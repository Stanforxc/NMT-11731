now , why does this matter a a of human health ?
here &apos;s a graph of the dolphins in the <unk> bay .
and i remember sitting on my desk , and i thought , &quot; i know . what a great scientific discovery , &quot; but it was so terrible .
they &apos;re all all the the and more more and more and more and and i think that should let this <unk> .
i started in the , , how how we have the ecosystem of monterey bay have have the pollution and the and and the and all kinds of problems .
<unk> -- <unk> <unk> .
about at the same time , him asked him , &quot; do you know the book of michael <unk> ? the &quot; ? &quot;
we really really afraid .
craig here the head .
you saw the skeleton .
we also have this ability .
it &apos;s , our modern kind of a something like this , , but i think we should also recognize , which price .
clay shirky , this great <unk> of all the , has the the , that is the the the <unk> , that that such wonderful .
now , there are so many new foundations , the <unk> and investment and investment that people together together , in a a , in a major context .
and i &apos;m hopeful , because not only the philanthropy is organized , and other other of the social and and business , use hard to use this business as it &apos;s <unk> .
i &apos;m this this this to me . it &apos;s in my office , because i &apos;ve always felt a a connection to these two men , i &apos;ve never been seen .
my own research research research and <unk> , that that 80 percent of all calls up up to four people . 80 percent .
whenever you have a moment , you &apos;re to to .
and with modern bureaucracy , a very <unk> approach , where it a clear <unk> between between the private environment and the public environment .
we we worry about <unk> , texting , facebook , , of the <unk> <unk> research , , how the the the the to the the relationships , to make love of the as distance and and and and .
one of the things we &apos;ve developed in the laboratory -- we developed several vehicles -- -- is how we believe that the first autonomous world of the world .
for example , the <unk> brain is to create a lot of <unk> .
no challenging task .
at the time , we pay money 60 60 60,000 in year , to to a people into jail .
their family lives in a a of a city called <unk> , west virginia .
yes .
we can create these local markets and incentives create create materials materials as resources materials .
and we all should invest in in .
and he won , , you , you can &apos;t think of a in in los angeles -- a reason to love love -- in the the the .
i started to to to to communities in the country to help their their potential potential to improve the entire quality of life of their people .
and before you don &apos;t have kids , you don &apos;t understand what i mean . &quot;
these deaf people are in in in in the . &quot; community .
it &apos;s always the time .
true guilt does just just one one of a person , and somebody with syndrome is not a person . &quot;
because the people &apos;s not more far .
but i found out for me that i &apos;ve been the kids i &apos;ve born , so love that i don &apos;t want to imagine you .
he would not reach its legs .
i come from a a family . i &apos;ve a lot of happiness .
it &apos;s about two weeks old . and there are .
this is beginning 2000 . my son , dimitri -- also here today , many of you know -- -- -- and has been built to to , and has built built to to the internet .
think of it -- because there are other people as bill gates , said , &quot; &quot; man , you have a real computer . &quot;
latin is also quite rare . let &apos;s look at some languages .
and guess what ? we won it .
we have a case for the , no a more <unk> to to to the the the .
for a <unk> , my apartment is about as to from space .
and we can care about the issues of <unk> .
i i to talk from a cliff , , i told me be too <unk> , even though i couldn &apos;t know , which the party that does or my .
prosperity is people people who are not to to be a <unk> .
in the issue , there &apos;s a more conversation .
none of this most , theories was a full success .
we &apos;re afraid that the world are watching .
and during a lot of this work , we found something , or i found something that really fascinated me , maybe you can remember it .
in fact , it &apos;s just happening -- from light to darkness in six seconds .
i see your faces very very .
that &apos;s not a expression of joy .
and this lady here has a particularly <unk> face , and both sides of them are beautiful .
this thing here , it &apos;s light light on it , so you get it , you get a <unk> object , although it &apos;s still -- just just how that &apos;s made by the reflection .
i had to move that part , but only one millimeter .
and one of what i showed you before , was a very complex .
it &apos;s it or lose it .
the emotional band between this object and you you , is a <unk> <unk> , which is happening before they think about it .
i don &apos;t think we need to meet those two .
it &apos;s also a thought that we forget .
i do it for for to to the of global ...
we &apos;re not thinking that way .
and at the end of the <unk> , they &apos;re all up and say , &quot; thank you <unk> , not , , , . &quot;
the other thing is that art should not explain to that artist would not tell your <unk> , because when they put it up , it was the magic , and we find it just .
art would have one of the tools that we we can improve our society .
we may not be with the the idea of what religions want to teach us , but we can admire the institutional way that they do it .
absolutely . i meet how many of you , people who say , &quot; isn &apos;t something bigger than we all all , something else ? &quot;
because you &apos;d agree with 90 percent , because you have a similar view of so many things , and you think about the think of the other .
so he was me in places like chile -- the <unk> desert in chile -- in in , in in , in in the , in the in the , in north america , until to antarctica and even the south pole .

this hut was built by robert <unk> <unk> and his men , when they came to antarctica , on their first expedition to the south pole .

this is an interesting statement , i &apos;ll come back to this .
what people are doing to do is <unk> <unk> that you can look at the the book , and it &apos;s fun .
there were a lot of people there .
but how do we scan them all ?
we &apos;ve the 10 cents per page when we work working with large volume .
i &apos;m not sure what what exactly what .
a day per is about two or three <unk> .
with 15 dollars per hour and and 100 dollars and 150 dollars a hour , we can make a very <unk> online online and and it &apos;s the net .
the question is : is this the world that we want to live ?
flowers are going to be <unk> .
we all know the earth has problems .
after the <unk> , , , <unk> .
if you go through the landscape , it <unk> up into their , and it to to the the .
across all the <unk> .
some of these mushrooms are very happy .
this is a extraordinary <unk> <unk> .

you take the the , you get blood , you <unk> the blood , it looked under the microscope , it the culture , it it into the .
but we need a <unk> , , for for patients .
and so , the medicine feels .
we looked at <unk> for the , we we looked at the <unk> , , and we found that they have technology and education , and they have something else , they have . .
and it &apos;s just just .
so these are really incredibly incredibly , and that &apos;s very significant .
so what that means is that that that are their dead peoples to their own people , and and they they have the losses .
you take their their and and their families their families to twice twice the year .
are are in in minority .
take a a in in new york with a <unk> , now , it &apos;s one one , , and that &apos;s as as san francisco within three years of the half the population of half the .
now , not all of us , , , or the that we can turn , and , and you can always get a meadow in a <unk> . .
and i &apos;ve been my my my my wife .
and to defend my title -- like <unk> and other , and other -- -- i thought i i left the 2005 , and won .

there was a very nice relationship between love and the of of the .
and i think the ceo of the doesn &apos;t really understand understand how important sense .
but i should point out , the way way that the the that people that people have have cheat .

they decide what they do .
it doesn &apos;t get help from government , and he a second , <unk> boat .
something that would us us all together .
scott &apos;s results were full of it .
and the challenge for the filter filter , these personalized filters is that they &apos;re to to this balance , because they go to first , first .
it &apos;s to to us about new ideas and and and ideas and ideas ideas .
and the man said , &quot; beautiful <unk> , what ? &quot;
i know that you &apos;re going to wait for other bad bad , -- i &apos;m just fun -- but now comes just a short short , and then i show you a new material over the solutions .
until the <unk> of may be an credit on on 2.0 2.0 , where you can go directly to the <unk> of <unk> .
well , all the republicans here : it should not be to to <unk> .
what really me me about the gulf is that they &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
and there &apos;s actually no one more , except , a few people who try to use the beach .
we have heard that bacteria eat oil ?
this <unk> is the the the ocean .
when the japanese pearl <unk> , they they they at least .
what the the of the birds , i don &apos;t want to do about people people people clean birds .
okay , people who are what what what they really really really really really really , and really really , , they should send this <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s about right and wrong .
and i developed a system to produce medical medical . .
all right , &quot; i &apos;m more than my genes -- all common .
i didn &apos;t asked to to it because it &apos;s true , but it &apos;s true to remember it .
they contain a molecule that we know as a . .
and this is just a <unk> . it &apos;s much smaller than a human human . .
now , neurons , how , like trees , can grow new branches and and old .
and we can even talk from the <unk> .
if you really the this number , you can make a that there is a big potential for the brain .
perhaps technology will be able to know that we know ourselves through through and and our own brain .
he &apos;s mainly on music music and and with his company , the <unk> <unk> .
so we &apos;ve been prepared an quick experiment to show you this .
ks : no , not yet .
as he did , , it was a sort of sort of .
ks : so , this is : there &apos;s a matrix of <unk> .
ridiculous , right ?
and a few months ago , a friend of a a a a a , , , eduardo sousa .
a huge conversation for a couple weeks .
but he still made it .
so his farm is incredible .
and he was this wild plant , the <unk> .
and then they fly in the circle .
i finally started to try and try before i went .
no salt , no <unk> , no oil , no <unk> .
what is the hell is that ?
at least , i think , it .
farmers who are to to nature to find answers solutions , instead of the nature of the
and from the old to to to , , , to change two two stories of oil and electricity , both two of the the fossil <unk> in the the .
our fuel for mobility is three fifth of cars .
you can get it quiet , it &apos;s harder than titan .
trucks and planes can use realistic hydrogen or advanced use use . .
so better light and and and so so the <unk> <unk> to a third .
in about 20 <unk> , , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , we have <unk> on their roofs and and their their .
and what we &apos;ve it it , it &apos;s going to be about the same thing : about about six trillion dollars in <unk> -- although we &apos;re buy more of it , and we have new nuclear power and and more , , or or more or more
so , results , and not incentives , focus on , can be <unk> and conflict to the most powerful solution to the most <unk> . america .
i first realized later , i realized that i had eaten two <unk> of his whole family .
this simple <unk> shows that that are in in areas where the least the children go to school , no school , , that &apos;s new simple : that &apos;s the most of the most of us ?
two years ago , on april 2010 , i called my father .
i &apos;m not trying to design the toothbrush .
we remember us and and we can find that in in the book of my son &apos;s son , that life , four billion years ago -- four billion two billion ?
so , i &apos;m not quite sure .
there are the , there are , there &apos;s a case : the vertical . .
you have time to think , you have time to do , to talk about art and things like that .
you go back into the future , back back , back , back , .
they &apos;re all coming from families , because mostly only one person at home , mostly mother mother , mother , and they come to their for their and and and your structure .
we bring them to turn to turn on the left and on the , so you can can and and the consequences , when they them them .
let &apos;s go all online . &quot;
it &apos;s <unk> .
they said , &quot; that &apos;s enough for <unk> .
you can support us . this is the task of you . &quot;
but i have to have my . .
you can listen and and .
let &apos;s take the <unk> <unk> .
if you think about the concept of wikipedia in the , each about the content , and at the end , you have the greatest encyclopedia in the world .
there are many people who have the same dream .
a a website was created .
there was no leader leaders .
extremism is become tolerance .
the modern tools of neuroscience show us that what happens happening here , an incredibly complex process .
we can keep the of of our own language , but not the &apos;re not about
we &apos;re by by the american babies that never never heard a second language , the perhaps the perhaps the critical phase .
it may look like a <unk> of mars .
science on one hand , a very rational approach to their environment , while art on the other side , a emotional approach to its environment .
now i &apos;ve got a <unk> over here to show you this .
let me show you over here .
the dalai lama said , &quot; love and compassion is <unk> .
the the were <unk> from a little girl by the body was <unk> .
it &apos;s part of human human . .
and when compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we choose with compassion ?
the wound <unk> of the maggots .
imagine you might take squares squares , and , , who doesn &apos;t ?
we start with a <unk> , and then we &apos;ll take another <unk> . .
then there was a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> .
i , &quot; he &apos;s already dead .
&quot; i i have <unk> ! &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t get a a . what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you doing here ? &quot;
so i went to the lobby , and i saw these indian guy .
marco tempest : if you asked him to deception , he said , &quot; , &quot; magic is the only <unk> .
where is the queen ?
i &apos;m going to demonstrate to you how extremely interconnected with our daily lives .
at the time when i interviewed the red brigades , i discovered that their lives didn not of ideology and politics politics , but by economic constraints .
i think a lot of people were myself to a little bit of a little bit .
but in fact , they went in serious <unk> with the crime .
this money was in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> -- in bar , understand .
nobody wants the to control his <unk> and his his <unk> <unk> with clients .
some of you might think , &quot; wait a minute . it doesn &apos;t necessarily look like a <unk> . .
so , i wanted to leave my <unk> , but but what i haven &apos;t seen seen was it is that it &apos;s a extremely uncomfortable to left his <unk> .
and i really learned that , the the the the the , the bigger the sense of a particular , if you get to end .
well , i thought the atlantic be big , but the pacific is really big .
but this didn &apos;t be <unk> .
it &apos;s this little green disk on the horizon , which they &apos;re very nervous because of the level of co2 level .
we can start , better , , , make more decisions decisions .
<unk> <unk> : why i <unk> over the pacific .
this is the world trade <unk> on the front page .
why ? why ? why would you do that ?
he doesn &apos;t cost a <unk> . he &apos;s not a extra time .
they were able to make that .
and the end it it about comfort , it &apos;s about you feel good at places where they didn &apos;t feel good good .
and that &apos;s hard if you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i asked , how can it be so easy to give my dreams ?
it &apos;s not so hard to get someone , , and one day , i said , &quot; yeah , you can my homework <unk> , &quot; and i gave him the wrong answers i had her on the night .
we both both the back in the the , we we would not be <unk> with <unk> .
you you have to get your <unk> and and and teeth , , , but , , how can you tell yourself , if all you want to buried up you it to you ?
this is french science .
well , go .
if you look at this truck , it &apos;s the largest truck of its on earth .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it &apos;s the largest and the the , and the the , in canada , and it &apos;s also the reason why canada is now number three is in terms per capita .
and as a father , i can &apos;t imagine what the of the soul .
by doing this , we &apos;re going to take a big part of our biggest <unk> , and and they replace it to most most of the gas gas oil of the future .
the <unk> of of the working is the <unk> that you can buy in any store , and millions of indian women have in on every day , and it &apos;s a a ritual that &apos;s <unk> with the the institution of marriage .

i hope hope you can &apos;t that complex and complicated are not always the same .
the <unk> <unk> is the the that we want -- the public support for the government .
so i came in my first tedtalk that we &apos;d be be 21 billion hours a week at a week .
just 30 minutes , a a day for a a a a larger improvement in the and and and the joy of joy .
why a game ?
how could a a game that a a a a huge effect in so serious , , , , , situations .
there are four types of strength , or resilience that produce growth growth , and there are scientific <unk> things that you can do every day to build these resilience , you don &apos;t need a trauma .
by through through through , it &apos;s going .
here &apos;s even a secret to you : if you &apos;re to hand , you &apos;re to your your , you &apos;re going to in your blood in your blood , the <unk> . .
and in this project , we &apos;ve actually got about hundreds of people around the world , and they are together together , and actually , thousands of people in this project , in many of of his different aspects .
and then a couple of people came from chicago and and , &quot; in the end of 2007 is the slogan of the <unk> , the global warming . we have a a of a , and we want them to fill them with your reef . &quot;
and and <unk> are not two concepts that are good .
<unk> said , &quot; how can i parallel with parallel lines ? &quot;
infinite . they &apos;re <unk> . . . .
so we have , from wanted to be , , , , , the the most famous <unk> of the math .
and their individual ideas , and their their of with this mathematical method .
this particular <unk> property -- -- -- -- is , is my opinion , is the holy grail of neuroscience , neuroscience , and , and eventually , we &apos;ll understand what &apos;s going on .
this person is otherwise with <unk> and and so , but when he sees his mother , his his , and he says it wasn &apos;t his mother .
so if this area is damage , you lose the ability to recognize faces .
tables and chairs -- nothing happens , just as as normal people , as i &apos;m going to show it a picture of his mother , the the the activity is low .
he knows that his arm is not there . nonetheless it &apos;s a a , , <unk> experience .
maybe you can the the the the the the the the the the phantom .
and my pain is gone . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , the last three days , i didn &apos;t have a phantom , and so no more in in the elbow , no <unk> , no <unk> , in the <unk> . all my pain
<unk> is blue is blue , <unk> is green , a other one could be yellow yellow .
that &apos;s the key .

it was too early , but he was a moral <unk> , a inspiration for scientists who were concerned about the control of the guns .
suppose we have absolutely alien creatures &apos;ve been watching our <unk> point from the in the cosmos and not only has been for 40 years , but the the of the the earth .
martin <unk> : : is this our last century ?
and it &apos;s even worse , &quot; then i would make a picture of this and a a dozen <unk> .
well , these are students , so they gave a lot of the money for things like <unk> and and .
and then we asked them , how happy they are .
but it &apos;s huge .
these are <unk> in in . .
the teams we we money to to to each other , , to other teams and and in the end in the end of the end .
if we hear today about the the of the , from the high , , us that that this is another of of this <unk> conflict of the middle of the the of the the of the .
ironically , it was a time when the <unk> of iran was was with with washington , and not the destruction of israel .
this is an analogy that are are to to the diplomacy , diplomacy , is diplomacy because is inevitable .
you can look at certain <unk> of , or you can look at the different regions and compare them .
the map of the <unk> <unk> at the end of 2009 was not as good as you could have been , not as well as the map of california .
the trick : the trick .
now , she she said , &quot; he he was not an &quot; . &quot;
this system wants to expand the status , , the status of the of the .
so it &apos;s not about my theme is the most important thing . it &apos;s not .
we can &apos;t do . &quot;
lawrence lessig : we , the citizens , the the republic of
for example , some of people in this room to have sputnik with a to to a to .
this is at my pen . &quot;
everyone &apos;s just a little bit of little bit .
i i don &apos;t want to tell that the is not true , is is true .
here in the model , you can the attack of the . .
if you see in north america , , the like many things are in in the in the united states . each other .
each of their <unk> &apos;s depends on this critical region , the <unk> that that has the the of the and the by the of the , of the , an electronic rhythm -- a very , -- -- a low -- to to a a signal to
they were a in in in , , but but they were .
so i i want to to show you a few of interviews of interviews that were to the opening on the bridge and describe what happened .
now you don &apos;t normally make a a , , but we all walk in the -- we &apos;re going to walk back and walk back .
am : the , there are a couple of tons , so you &apos;re going to go . fast .
it &apos;s the <unk> scientist in in his . .
i didn &apos;t say what the list was , but she was in <unk> order , and i told them , they should look for your name , or your <unk> , or your mother &apos;s <unk> .
and also perhaps that <unk> , maybe , or maybe a <unk> that that not worth economic , , or or or or or or or or a different property that is useful for climate change , and the other .
we &apos;re going to see a <unk> .
the idea of a was that it &apos;s cold , so you have natural temperatures under the . .
and if something happens , you can come and pick it up .
thank you .
watch your your . . this is not right .
maybe any lady , , lady , a lady ? thank you .
you only have two concepts of the united states -- two in the united , and one in the the russians .
so ! i have to talk about a little bit about a -- -- -- the things are , there &apos;s a lot of activity , and then they &apos;ll getting with and
i can &apos;t tell you when it &apos;s going , because i don &apos;t want the competition to be my . .
i mean something really interesting interesting that is going to happen here .
ok , we &apos;re going to talk a little bit about the commercial development of space space .
it &apos;s like the air .
after a couple of years , he &apos;s ready to give up , but one day he has a . .
institutions are &quot; naked &quot; , &quot; and if you &apos;re naked , well , has the consequences .
the fourth importance of openness and the fourth principle , is <unk> .
the the is out of the <unk> .
you know that bees and fish in in life .
all around us , a medical revolution , revolution , a revolution that will help us to to some of the worst diseases of our society , including including .
this is a tumor , , , gray , a <unk> mass , <unk> in a brain .
and you can see that the ring at the supply supply for the treatment .
but the question question is : how well do this work in practice ?
here &apos;s what happens when we add an <unk> , , and not angiogenesis is very effective .
but more more interesting goes from the study that the men who developed the the , , which have more more sauce sauce , , the more violent vessels that had their cancer .
<unk> by <unk> , once said that &quot; discoveries made to see what all of all seen , and think , nobody thought . &quot;
i &apos;m a <unk> in discover magazine .
it has to be fun , different problems , which are , , are not very good <unk> .
one is the the background .
you can &apos;t do that physically , but it &apos;s on a computer . over to the computer .
i wanted to make a sequel .
which the direction that we have going to fall ?
so there are games like &quot; brain , , &quot; the <unk> , , , <unk> .
looks like a a a . where is that ?
i really believe that a girl , so powerful is that we we had to train all to not be so that .
i remember as for example , my father , was very , very violent , was proposed .
we &apos;re so used to be , , , of the , of their own life , that we actually made them to objects , and they were into them .
and they looked into the eyes of her babies and said , &quot; of course , &quot; love , &quot; i love my baby . how could i love my baby ?
when we were there , they did a ritual that they girls , who are <unk> with their families .

i love that i don &apos;t take things easy to . things .
why should they be <unk> me , <unk> ?
so , in the actual process , all six teenagers , and <unk> the <unk> that they had made the the .
but the incident came in the middle of january , in the northern hemisphere , at night night night .
that &apos;s 10 feet away .

and , odd gives you odd .
we have a <unk> . .
the bad news is .
instead of to friends , , , they looked at <unk> . .
today , it &apos;s been developing development in a hundred countries , and it &apos;s up to the <unk> .
you get to to .
we can give up some rules and and look at them .

one thing that i want to to be clear is that not all the the <unk> .
we can take them up or turn down , or down or your down .
it &apos;s one of five children .
i showed you that we can apply it to in the circuits of depression .
we &apos;re to understand what these circuits are and what brain of the in the clinical scale and symptoms are these diseases are responsible . disease .
evolution works in a really more like a engineer as an engineer .
that &apos;s enough !
what we &apos;ve discovered is whether you look at the leg of a people like richard , or a a cockroach or a <unk> , a <unk> , the relative <unk> of this feather is the the of that we &apos;ve seen .
okay . the point is , it &apos;s really hard to say , right ? it &apos;s incredible , it &apos;s incredible , students , and they couldn &apos;t say it .
it does this with a <unk> glue .
what we do is we we take the hair as a model model , and they them together with another colleagues from berkeley .
showed that from the <unk> leaders , , , two third of the men children children are , but only a third of the most <unk> women .
on the , i left san francisco , my <unk> , and flew to this conference .
and we go out at the end , look at and say , &quot; what did it walked for you ? &quot;
there &apos;s a famous study school school school of a a woman called heidi <unk> .
and i &apos;ve my hand back and i and i was it in all other women , and then you were to do more of , just of men . &quot;
and a woman took me me and i looked at them -- she saw something young .
thank you .
they don &apos;t do it as as as they should , but they do .
so , was not fear of the .
but it comes in the in the .
now , i want to talk about this about about how we &apos;re in in this country , we we get to information information .
so they &apos;re in in <unk> , the language , , and it works .
we tell them that everything is okay ; it &apos;s going to be good .
this patient is about 50 , we can actually say pretty much exactly how big risk of risk of cancer prostate cancer .
they don &apos;t need the level level of audience in this hall .
and that bee , was he , &quot; i &apos;m going to <unk> this <unk> , this flower , i get get the nectar and then i go out . &quot;
and when you talk about nature that &apos;s as my favorite subject , how is the idea of the ?
all right , we &apos;re all equally <unk> .
the only technology here is the cheap <unk> : quite a to a a <unk> , , , i could be a <unk> of 10 of 10 in 15 minutes .
if a <unk> <unk> , the grass is going to this <unk> , and it it it something interesting .
and now i say that i want to build a layer of the world of the world , but it &apos;s not quite true because it &apos;s in the development ; it &apos;s happening .
if not , the is a . . there &apos;s nothing to do .
come come to a certain time , they get their <unk> of the price .
and then they can reach on different different species .
and it &apos;s powerful .
<unk> is a of of of the that the best news , the most exciting stories .
we &apos;ve been talking last last time before you .
you also see see that , i i , i i i &apos;t go to the the world .
you can see , it &apos;s started .
this is one of our engineers .
<unk> , who had been to teach students , , the law of the <unk> , just as as a as a . .
raise your hands .
it makes it to a place where it &apos;s fun .
and so this is what we work on , and we &apos;ve even have people people about the excited about it and crazy enough that they work on it , that &apos;s really their goal .
thank you .
what , , as he said , for his passengers was the experience of the through the landscape .
what does the live easier , , ?
and part of it , to , by a a great new facility , the the the the the of of their hospitals .
today , the industrial systems of time <unk> <unk> and and in fact , in part of the kind problem .
and as we can , we can , we can have a <unk> of , , a larger effect .
from my <unk> , , the the the the with his <unk> .
mark <unk> and i tried to a series of studies to to answer this question .
yet , it &apos;s exactly what the the the the the the paradigm .
but for the <unk> , , the availability of all of these <unk> in the market .
the americans discover that the choice choice in the the the the the the the in practice .
<unk> parents would be more more things like , &quot; noah was just for for so short time , but he &apos;s taught us much .
robert <unk> once said , &quot; it &apos;s poetry that goes into translate . &quot;
&quot; well , it &apos;s a very elegant <unk> of pink . &quot;
the three problems have one common common : they are <unk> problems that are by by by forces .
so thank you very much .
it would have to to through collaboration .
and then we build a <unk> that we can test the <unk> media , , we can can , and we can be very , very quickly .
girl : no .
and so i realized that the the best of the best best is not be a a a <unk> , but as a <unk> movement .
the the the the the stage .
and then the 92 channels that the the energy that the the the the the from los angeles .
you take it and it it it to the your your your your your your your your and and and on the out on the , right .
if you replace the word of the , or the &apos;s for the internet , it &apos;s very really , that that &apos;s very <unk> , now . let &apos;s hear . .
i think it was for the exchange that has led to information .
ph : i hope you realize how <unk> that is .
and finally the race to to the future of the , the the company .
mm : because it gave a a a role to do something .
they produce things for 1,500 and 800 dollars per minute .
and where television is what is built , is a very exciting new kinds of communication , and we have the <unk> of two industries and a new way of thinking to see it .
this is an spanish architect and designers .
color can <unk> simple blocks , simple materials : when i go through new york , i &apos;m on .
i &apos;ve been to , , -- maybe there &apos;s a day day in san francisco , and we all talk us and and and and we a few installations .
the the the the the the the public space is significant , almost an international model .
even the the of the airplane had french names .
he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s there there there there .
and it was , i , i , after some of the and <unk> , the the the seat i i i show you .
he said , you have one of the new , better chairs .
or they move up to the way that they &apos;re them .
i i i , i i , and i was in the office , where there was <unk> with <unk> , that was never to to to the idea , to turn a <unk> and to to to and to
and it &apos;s <unk> in <unk> .
two days ago , i can &apos;t remember exactly , i i read in a <unk> that that <unk> the first <unk> <unk> , , , , , , , , about 400 400 <unk> cases .
we need something that really really <unk> the that that it doesn &apos;t get the disease .
here &apos;s a typical situation : males over females , there &apos;s a of individual individual .
so , are not our biggest problem .
&quot; why ? &quot; why ? &quot;
and most of the time i &apos;m not to , though i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> .
look at the available data .
now , our mobile phones can build a story of our <unk> .
bill <unk> : your health depends on where you live .
this is my grandfather .
the simple reason that no else is talking about it .
like the , , , , through water out of water .
here &apos;s a title of a remarkable article from a <unk> of nature , &quot; which the the the the the the crisis crisis .
the 80 percent of that are said said .
and instead of a million of 100 percent of 100 percent of 100 percent .
we have a working technology and and one that is using a <unk> of of the <unk> , we we &apos;re going to the the the world of the world .
and he was a called called <unk> : he looked at all the <unk> and mutations and the and of , instead of look at the norms .
and in this example , you see the the , , , , but they &apos;re again without being <unk> .
because , i think , only just relationships between the pieces and the whole , but in terms of it &apos;s more more to a matter of businesses .
we &apos;re going to the the level of the the where we could build the five five towers , but they should all all on the <unk> floor to a single <unk> mass .
come back back , a few years later , in 2003 , and we &apos;ll see that this landscape is actually actually in <unk> as as as as as .
the difference is in in in in in desert , or maybe <unk> in <unk> , whatever you want .
there &apos;s a lot of toxic trash , a lot of things that were illegal illegal and now in the .
we have doubled the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the world , just by using that , the huge problems in water quality , and in rivers , and , and , and and it &apos;s the most important <unk> for for . .
but we can do that , and there are opportunities .
however , the biggest <unk> of the on the <unk> .
so need to work together .
so -- what is this really use system d ? ?
we want to see our products in the store . &quot;
the whole system system doesn &apos;t pay no control .
we interact with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we &apos;re using biological <unk> to provide this <unk> -- -- muscles .
this is what this looks like .
here we <unk> , or cut the <unk> , , , of the , and , and , and the other , that had our our -- -- : : two other that gave us our hand -- signal .
ak : it works well .
but i can &apos;t have a and and say , &quot; there . &quot;
and that &apos;s our goal -- something more more to to have to have .
this is jesse , and he &apos;s a <unk> .
so thank you .
sub-saharan africa has the condition , , 22 million people with hiv , which are were 70 70 percent of the 30 million people are infected .
governments need to create effective effective <unk> for the ethical aspects of in clinical trials that are going in the various developing world , <unk> , , which are in the government and the <unk> of the study .
the the the issues that we are faced , so too much of and and many people .
so they &apos;re all the criteria that usually people people .
so you can see that power that &apos;s going to -- -- the <unk> in this case -- the to to the the , and the <unk> , the <unk> , the the the the the the the .
we also know that not only are are threatened by but penguins and and other people .
so i want to show you that penguins are moved in <unk> .
turbo has <unk> to <unk> with his <unk> with his <unk> , we and we come in and and it comes in here .
and then there &apos;s another thing that comes in very comfortable .
now , here &apos;s a fundamental problem that we don &apos;t solved : our basic political political . .
the two are a very long a .
again , as in the , , china , two or . it &apos;s <unk> .
for countries countries , china goes up to the <unk> , , and and cambodia and cambodia were their less cheaper cheaper to be depending on china .
what i want to show you here , i call <unk> day day day .
these two arrows form a bow , a bow of <unk> and others infrastructure that connects the west bank with the the . .
a lot of them .
so what are next ? what &apos;s the future of the european union ?
53 countries and far most most of the the came straight lines on the map .
this dream exists there .
it &apos;s bad ? it doesn &apos;t seem like that .
okay .
and the hormone <unk> is the growth .
so how can a hormone the the the speed of the ?
we think that insulin and environmental hormones are are , are active in , in , -- good times -- -- when food is there , and there &apos;s not a lot of stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details about how it works , but we know that foxo gene is an impact on the life life life .
and basically , , you could change genes genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process that i talked talked to what is going to actually , a a , a different normal , , like for example , the bird can live a lot longer life .
you will never see an display , because , to to to buy their shoes .
you all of heroes , the <unk> .
it &apos;s like trying to run a a <unk> . .
this is that that that that many of <unk> <unk> are <unk> like prozac in the the the of the brain , as if the brain is the of of performance of chemical soup .
and my <unk> colleague , seymour <unk> thinks believe that .
we found out that a that , a , , a , , a lot longer , to the the <unk> , and when we put genes genes that did in this mutation that could have a role in this mutation .
and this question is , you &apos;ve been asked to people , , but we can actually actually test it .
so , , , , we find us in the in they smell . . . smell .
so you see it , that &apos;s the cheese .
people even told me that you &apos;re going to get getting by mosquitos .
in <unk> .
and every time i felt the <unk> <unk> of the the <unk> of the . .
and as <unk> , fat is one of the best sources for adult stem cells .
while we &apos;re talking about , about more trials , at the research research use use use use of stem cells .
we &apos;re very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angels in the world , not just in our country : venezuela . in our entire world .
so what happens when that &apos;s not happening ?
but here you see what &apos;s going on .
i can &apos;t tell you anything about it because i &apos;ve stopped in the headline .
<unk> <unk> : what you know about knowledge knowledge
but how ?
it &apos;s even better better . it seems that we can make that that , with the help of them that that that in dna .
the animal jumps , it &apos;s <unk> its wings , it &apos;s <unk> , , but it can &apos;t actually come into it , because the fly between two <unk> .
for an intelligent like like our fly , not not in stone , but changes , as the animal &apos;s through through experience .
so many many experiments , we were able to the the of the the of the the .
there &apos;s a couple of ideas in the <unk> and artificial intelligence , how to do that , but we still haven &apos;t solved a single example of how intelligent behavior from the physical <unk> of the the
here &apos;s actually , , or actually a <unk> of of . .
ed : right . &quot; . : okay , well , a little bit of inside , a little bit more .
i i know that in some of the , i know that hospitals can be very dangerous place to young people .
here &apos;s a picture of my <unk> of the legacy .
one of one i i tell you , this kind of <unk> , that <unk> all of their , their their , , the the <unk> transformation that we &apos;re going to see our in
they don &apos;t stick or an <unk> or a <unk> or glue .
here we have the robot .
<unk> <unk> built the <unk> <unk> .
what would happen if you were to the the of the the and and it would come up a <unk> , or we would shake the slate ? &quot;
and so <unk> did , and he &apos;s doing this .
of course , completely different as you would see this in a <unk> . .
we &apos;re going to look at the level level .
and i would say that people are working in the ocean and think about the goals , we think they should be much lower .
this is the ship i i was the last three months in antarctica .
when this ice ice ice puts up feet feet feet .
what was the cause ?
in both cases , the bad news is the the of the galapagos .
your relationship is the water water .
but then at the end of the the the the in black .
we have very interesting ways to have the the of the the atmosphere in the atmosphere of years , we &apos;ve just done with <unk> , but in this case , we go back 20 million years .
and this is the task that einstein asked , to figure out how how gravity is .
and einstein had already done space and time , biases and curves in the to to the gravity .
but deep in the structure of the room , the the idea , the idea could be able to do more than we see there .
and just as the the of a cello , different , , which that actually have a more and in different patterns .
not yet .
is this just an interesting mathematical construction that may be able to explain some of some <unk> of of the world , or can we actually tell these extra dimensions ?
so we have two two together two together with them dots .
now , can the the predator , the the that is , do it attack ?
and what sensory information is true , generally , for all of information .
and we look at about 30 seconds , which is a real hammer in a a of a .
why ? because if the the in in this shadow actually would be in the shadow , and the same amount of light on your eye , the the the the , , you would have to reflect more -- -- simply after the laws of physics
how do you know that ?
and it comes into the hive , it &apos;s got empty <unk> and and it , and it &apos;s honey .
he finds him . awesome , right ?
do you think ? ? ?
there &apos;s not a very , or there &apos;s no right or wrong .
in in in new york , not so much .
we also have a species of the storyteller .
now some things : understanding of security , the risks , the the , the the , how they work .
but in a modern and complex world need you models to the the of we we are .
think of cancer , flu flu , flu , sars .
there were no new insights , but less fear .
and there &apos;s another cognitive cognitive role : i call it <unk> to to to data that to to the data and and data and data data on the our <unk>
i was familiar with another group , whether my airplane was safe to fly to fly .
this is the people .
and he was found near , , in stanford .
they had good good with their teachers , students .
let me ask you some questions about whether that is a good choice . &quot;
i i , any of , i to to to save them or save a volunteer , , but i found that nobody was doing something .
we opened the first section in 2009 .
robert <unk> : build a park in the sky
and groups became often also used in the .
you need a <unk> process process that the core of this very complicated society can deal with its problems .
it &apos;s about that we probably probably probably the first time in the history of the arab world , a revolution , a a <unk> .
now paradox is that the <unk> of the the <unk> was so promising , and it &apos;s a a one of a main main .
once once , the ngos were not to to the the the streets -- but they they they they into the in the , because they <unk> the victims of these weapons .
thank you very much .
but i don &apos;t think that &quot; <unk> is something good .
so this was completely smooth .
it &apos;s a little bit crazy to work on a new <unk> .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , you know , this strange rich man in the movie ?
it &apos;s a great tooth . &quot;
and the last day , the sun come out , come out , you come directly to the boat . it &apos;s fantastic .
i i i i &apos;m a little little little a little of radical things , i &apos;m going to tell you about about about about about about about the audience , a audience , a lot of people who people who &apos;s many more than i do .
the part of the genome that we can read is the list of ingredients .
there &apos;s a huge amount of information in genetics by just just the genetic way .
and i , &quot; okay , at least this guy is good . . &quot;
and we we &apos;re in the same of of a as a own .
if you have malaria , we give them <unk> , or some of the .
where we really have to get to is the process that is just going on , and on the the level of the <unk> activity on the the of the , why doesn &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t stop how it do it ?
danny hillis : using it .
they &apos;re all members of tribes .
it &apos;s not enough to give up these people .
because at stage three , most of us .
that &apos;s their lobby .
there was no plan plan . never before someone else .
in fact , martin luther king &apos;s sentence in stage three .
so i &apos;m sitting there in this chair , and nothing nothing . &quot;
and all of all , they brought out the <unk> and tried to figure out , , &quot; how do we ask the population of sub-saharan africa ? &quot;
automatically automatically <unk> the little little from plastic plastic .
this <unk> or <unk> <unk> that were designed to make much to to the the the the the ground , they were not to a permanent buildings .
they <unk> the stability and security that can offer the lap of a uncle , you compare them with the <unk> construction of a <unk> niece in high . .
but from my perspective , compassion is a problem .
and it &apos;s the <unk> form of <unk> . .
i can &apos;t really explain them , and it doesn &apos;t really .
stories like this , , , , practical aid in a world that that for , to to compassion compassion , the the of suffering that may be otherwise otherwise .
gandhi was also a really <unk> person .
and the first day our our our our our our , and we taught us we had to give the the for the the the the the the the the the the .
this is one of two or three of their known .
here are some examples .
it turns out that we can &apos;t be part of a group without a , , , you can see the others .
so that &apos;s the world that we live in today .
and so i &apos;m trying to learn to my my my my my own way .
okay , number two : you go into the wild .
and imagine that , you a a a a a a very small village in mexico , in , , , , , very <unk> , and my parents didn &apos;t have higher school .
and so we believe that through all the of the that happens happened we we have incredible opportunities .
it &apos;s an initiative that &apos;s in simple , <unk> , and and solutions solutions .
we &apos;ve got 30 different conversations in 18 different countries , and we were able to connect millions of people , in the to learn what this particular market needs needs and
and my my father &apos;s father , my father said to me , &quot; you know , i remember remember that every generation of them has to better than the previous previous .
i know a lot of people who are very smart , and still , , &quot; why can i &apos;t my problem ? &quot;
i started started with a other family .
do not think that we have the responsibility to take the conscious seriously ? &quot;
i &apos;m going to go through the same four years of like before .
but that &apos;s not a good life .
that &apos;s what he &apos;s .
whether you believe it or not , for me .
he said , &quot; what do you think in your hand ? &quot;
what &apos;s this in your hand ? &quot; i said , &quot; it &apos;s a bit , and this one represents your identity , what you are .
when my kids were even more small , i always went to her room , sat down to her bed , and i my my kids to sleep .
it &apos;s less than i had <unk> -- i had a 10 10 10 million 10 million -- but it &apos;s a very significant number .
in a village , we have 100 laptops , everyone with a different collection of 100 books , so the village of a a of a .
right , the famous chinese characters characters for <unk> .
and you answer the question : how does it feel like , you you you to ?
we really learn really good good lesson really good .
think of a moment of what it is , to feel like it &apos;s .
and unlike all other animals are we we &apos;re obsessed with it to try to find it .
and i have to tell you that i thought i thought , i write this incredible <unk> book about a theme that everybody hate to be for an audience that would never be .
of course , the effect of of course , not just <unk> <unk> , , , of the .
in 1986 , they came from vietnam from vietnam .
the answer was <unk> , &quot; that &apos;s even worse . &quot;
our <unk> took down to a third of the <unk> in our industry , and in the the of the the , , our <unk> <unk> .
and bhutan , for the that don &apos;t know , the youngest democracy of the world , only two years old .
it &apos;s actually that we in the west , in the west , , as be , as be happiness , that we would have to be a , , or maybe things that we need to get .
and we make 10 simple questions -- that &apos;s simplicity .
what we have really to to be as leaders is that we can affect the the of of production by create the right conditions , so our employees can live their . .
bl : okay . one , two , three .
among deck , you you you the , you you you , you , but the eyes move moving in the boat boat , and say , &quot; i &apos;m still . &quot;
amy , you you up ?
the way : what did you made ? what what what you would ? ?
i just read one one .
real scientific education should be a voice to make people make them and make them to express this , and so &apos;s is the last word in this short history .
poor people have &apos;t have this possibility of choice .
we were <unk> in the 70s .
and in fact , to get coming up , we need to see that the principle of a <unk> of not only the the species that we &apos;ve talked about , but also our society .
today , 60 years later , i can tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure , anybody you already asked , , &quot; yes , great things up there -- but how do i come up ?
i was a at the <unk> davis so much of a lot of attention . and that would tell me the the start of the program .
we have eight eight motors in this vehicle .
thank you .
they fall apart apart , they fall out and you end up here .
i mean , people ask whether they &apos;re sure .
you have a <unk> .
because , remember the original idea of dr. <unk> : the <unk> cell phone of his wife .
and for those who can &apos;t read it : &quot; it seems like , it &apos;s actually a kind of <unk> technology . &quot;
green or natural <unk> , where they &apos;re not <unk> , , the right direction , but they don &apos;t care about the <unk> of in our bodies .
first , a <unk> , , , with <unk> , , the <unk> death death . .
only months later , i was , who was really .
i &apos;m looking for a cure .
i say , &quot; keep it in life when you can . &quot;
even with this <unk> paper in our hands , we have the hope to the hope .
it &apos;s a feature .
he suddenly he it was ever .
so to to you this , we need to get them back to the driver &apos;s . .
we <unk> the area , we <unk> it , we sent people in , we <unk> the building from the inside , the <unk> , we helped the the first <unk> , , search and rescue
if i do this , i &apos;m not losing the original details . the opposite , i could write story .
you &apos;re been by the public public .
that &apos;s not very good .
and which is a democracy is .
here is the question : which land cut better , china , china or india ?
because the indian man has a advantage of two two of two two of two two .
what political change , they &apos;ve introduced .
china , i think , has some few of , , -- -- especially in the of of a capital , public health , , a sense of equality , that doesn &apos;t have in india .
it was a place where people with <unk> <unk> and and and and and and <unk> .
and now you have the problem that they &apos;ve spent the all the money to help help help with this advanced electronics in these countries and now everything is <unk> .
a &apos;s a a of chaotic environment where probably many of ideas came , where humans have more , , , , , , , , -- people people different . .
another , a a few decades ago , a wonderful <unk> was called howard <unk> called and and darwin &apos;s reading &apos;s reading &apos;s from from from the period .
they were <unk> on their colleagues , but everybody said , &quot; no , i didn &apos;t think it to do it .
does that going to the other way ?
in the 1970s , &quot; one percent &quot; 10 percent of the national income in the united states .
many of these political factors can be in in in in in , , , political political that that a group of a a group of a <unk> , , but actually nothing good for the rest of us .
as you can just see , as globalization and technological revolution , this global world of the global &apos; of money , it &apos;s much more difficult to the the .
so , they invest in of of time and tools to to your kids .
we created the modern <unk> .
that &apos;s his small hand .
one of them will all die .
that was a huge <unk> to us , because we had had a new development .
i actually think in places like oregon , where you can can and can take a <unk> a a a a a a a a a a a percent have ever done .
so , a long time , a , , , they came to canada .
but i heard about cancer as the most of the the of the , how how and the the good and the bad thing together ?
and some of articles , in fact , , some of the that that is to cancer cancer cancer , and beyond cancer , not only against cancer , but it &apos;s spread in muscle muscle .
16 percent ! that that that there was this <unk> tumors in muscle muscle , but only 16 percent of the actual , -- which is that muscle muscle that the <unk> may be able to control the , the tumors that that <unk> these blood
this is a very very very , , , , but i really believe that that is possible .
after that , my was my translator .
she was the girl who in the the the the other to their team .
and in the moment i wrote a letter to my my my friends in atlanta , georgia , who had 11 year-old son .
&quot; what did he say ? &quot; i asked the translator .
so , the two came to lunch , and we went out of the restaurant .
he had kids from from from korea , and he found her families .
they &apos;ve a lot of time over the dictionary .
so i open the window , look look at the , and see how from the side of the hotels to the height . the hotel . .
so we did the the , , and and and and them and the the children .
until the adoption is by a year ! what does it need for that long ?
that &apos;s your <unk> .
this is sydney , which is going to a few days days days .
but there was no evidence .
there are small planets , there &apos;s a planet , there are a lot of planets , okay .
but there &apos;s a lot more to do .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomenon universal , or is it something that depends on the planet ?
and the deeper <unk> , the the point is that science is in the life , the life , to define it .
okay , let &apos;s say this is the size of the the universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , okay , from here .
thank you very much .
look : see , while uganda and zimbabwe <unk> , up to russia .
they find the highest hiv in the world in african countries , and yet they find them in senegal , the the same rate like in the united states .
look at this here kenya .
it might be something else is that the transmission is more .
we know about about billion people ever lived living .
it wasn &apos;t just an economic story .
and the result is even a bigger amount in a lot period than it in a a of of .
it &apos;s the same with institutions .
they have to give me to food . &quot;
he was wrong .
well , i want to ask with three three questions about the future billion , when the united states when the united states as number one of without china .
no , we &apos;ll be able to be , , of huge <unk> that we have , , , of our our , we we lost our work , and other parts of our historical <unk> .
lc , thank you .
there are many kinds of spider silk .
spider silk is almost completely out of protein .
the fibers that can create a single spider , are quite diverse .
also , <unk> , a a of potential to their ability to <unk> .
what i &apos;m going to realize is not the <unk> , as they as they as they like , , but the photos .
you have to have a physical structure .
there are more photos . there are more photographers .
this sounds <unk> in our ears , but what what what what happens is that 80 percent of the <unk> have have a lot .
the first thing that happens when you &apos;re a problem problem is that the the first goal of the institution immediately immediately is the the .
the inventor don &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states that try to find out whether is journalists are not .
it was created by by the <unk> , , using the of of of tools , and , , , the the world &apos;s the world today today the the same work for the last week .
you have <unk> , which probably the most of of the , or the the fibers , because it &apos;s just of fibers , because it &apos;s made of fibers .
everything is in the space . first level .
we call it &quot; <unk> . &quot;
but let &apos;s look at the different steps , under the <unk> of the the of the the <unk> level -- my search is to the the answer to the question , what is it so particularly in bread ? &quot;
this is transformation , two different things .
and if you &apos;re shaped , you &apos;re going to to to to to to to the life , and it &apos;s .
if you make this bread , you can use any kind of spent from them from them from them .
it will going to be a kind of <unk> , as we &apos;re working through this talk .
it takes very , very long , to write these scores , and i work on a piece that is the , for , and that is a big part of my life and i &apos;m the hair .
it &apos;s going to <unk> by brian <unk> , which is an extraordinary artist .
so this gives you a little <unk> of of the piece .
what we did -- and <unk> , , one of my students students , and i -- we gave the babies two two two two , a a <unk> a <unk> , , a a <unk> of <unk> .
i mean , the end of the end , , we look at babies , , they &apos;re pretty useless .
and our babies and children are a lot lot of lot to us than the babies of every other species .
the <unk> is it it to to to the hypothesis .
now there are two things that are really interesting about it .
boy : why .
our consciousness is extremely bright and and , and and everything else will dark .
&quot; babies and young children are like the research and the of the human species , &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , their research , how babies are <unk> the information and make decisions .
if i just to to for a little demonstration for a little demonstration of the difference -- because it &apos;s actually quite trivial .
then then you get this process over and over and over , until something that comes out -- in this case , the figure , as i &apos;m going to go .
what we really wanted was to be the whole human body .
you can &apos;t do that .
here &apos;s a few of very simple scenes , how it goes .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we &apos;ve done it .
some have already use our software to do that , and we &apos;re going to be a few of our <unk> in a few of big <unk> .
we thought he just would just the balance .
you &apos;re going to to go to the <unk> , -- most of you hope you .
but i have to say , i &apos;ll never forget what happened i was 13 years old .
i &apos;m convinced art and creativity , and creativity is not to develop .
if you &apos;re the lonely , you &apos;re a a new york times column , you get hundreds of emails . most of the what me what what &apos;s me about about .
some stories are just , , , and it &apos;s so . .
it &apos;s <unk> . nobody one has ever bought it .
there &apos;s a border that we don &apos;t want to don &apos;t want to don &apos;t we want to do ? what &apos;s the solution ?
this is microsoft word , ok , if you want to create a new , kind of power , like that might be !
but i think there are actually two <unk> of . .
the other products were being by microsoft with a open standard , rather of our <unk> . .
and <unk> , when someone came me a a <unk> -- -- what happened every day day -- i say , &quot; &quot; . &quot;
but when i looked at the <unk> technologies , , , , , and others in come in in the kinds of digital technology , i made a very big worry about the . .
and to just to the danger of these new new things , we have to just the the ability to the the the that they &apos;re the access to the .
i think the challenge that we stand , i &apos;m very sure that is going to happen -- the challenge is : are we going to develop this <unk> with the background that we have to this this device that we have to this
and if you build a three-dimensional game , for example , , , , they have all kinds of incredible properties .
and to give you a sense of the last new new new , , , -- he &apos;s <unk> to 400 million dollars , which is quite remarkable for us .
and if you can the concept of insurance , , , you can a a lot of <unk> -- -- the the of the market -- to use feedback feedback .
12 years ago , caves started to <unk> , , and i i my my research in this direction .
so wonderful and and things .
there &apos;s ice there under the surface .
so they &apos;re a <unk> form form .
it &apos;s even so much energy energy in this cave that there is actually a large number of <unk> .
we can see them .
we noticed a few years ago that caves have many thousands of properties that have used by the people and other organisms used to be . .
whenever you have a goal , , to , to , to , , , , , , , , , to go away .
and so it &apos;s in archimedes , the great greek mathematician .
it was made it , and it was from <unk> .
that means before we could start to the the the , , we had to take the book apart apart .
and this is what it looks like .
but by going to the speed of speed around speed , they &apos;re going to . .
this was a bad idea , because the <unk> of of , a a , alexander the great , and she lost the battle of <unk> .
because at the moment , their data , the data , and so that .
the original <unk> of the bottle of the the of the the century .
i i asked , 160 dollars for such ?
she has four .
a <unk> is is that many of these things from japan -- you &apos;ll notice it .
i mean , a <unk> , <unk> toilet .
there was an object that i couldn &apos;t get into the finger , and that was the <unk> cheval blanc .
and i can &apos;t -- call my taste of a <unk> -- so it &apos;s not necessarily significant that i was not impressed , but i was not the only one there , with this reaction .
in this year , a virtual asteroid sold it for for real real .
the really interesting about it is that you can measure it .
well , i could develop a game called <unk> , by just by a a of a , or or a thousand pies .
if it &apos;s real boxes , we can &apos;t do a lot , but in a game , we say , &quot; ok . &quot;
this is absolutely critical and and is is .
and i want to tell you a short story , in 1999 -- there was a video game video game .
it &apos;s about how as commitment commitment turns through the psychological and neurological insights that we get when we play humans play .
it &apos;s a kind of <unk> <unk> that &apos;s called the as a <unk> .
i &apos;m a <unk> , and i &apos;m totally obsessed with diet .

this is a <unk> that i &apos;ve got two years ago , that was was in one of the biggest projects i i &apos;ve been involved in my company .
but i &apos;m going to just just just the the of the process , three very <unk> . .
if we &apos;re so good , what we do , we should we be able to create a architectural manifestation that which is absolutely <unk> <unk> through the <unk> and <unk> ?
the architectural was , <unk> , , simple .
and this is the real <unk> of the .
the second technology we we we we we we &apos;re to know that the the of of an opera opera .
here you see the <unk> configuration configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk about you about how you &apos;re sitting in something like a <unk> .
one of these projects about a year and a year .
these are the images that automatically automatically created .
as long as i i wake up , i had the camera around the neck .
you can see a little bit that the the exciting moments of history .
it &apos;s <unk> . well , on .
a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> .
a <unk> , <unk> farmer .
what if you found the truth , year , what would you do the next years years of life ?
&quot; make money and a a , &quot; was the indian <unk> .
and the the , he told told you that he wanted to be , and he had given me about a of of . .
don &apos;t get me wrong , my , has been .
and the hand is almost impossible , except in <unk> , and then &apos;s is to .
very funny people , if lol means that means .
you don &apos;t do that .
if if someone would have seen in a black board of 1993 in the , the <unk> had been been a little bit of &quot; love story , &quot; but he had had what was there .
i &apos;m to talk about the <unk> , i i wanted to say , if you &apos;re in new york , you can look at at the next week at the week , and also in the <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
afghanistan , afghanistan is not an existential threat to the global security .
and the same thing is the troops .
instead , there was a <unk> of of <unk> optimism .

and finally , we need to understand that the secret of what we did in bosnia and kosovo , the secret of our success of our our , to the great part of our our , -- in the very <unk> kind of of .
rory , they started to , .
so here you can see two examples .
this is an example of the same system , on a way to show you what it looks like .
there &apos;s also <unk> that are <unk> , , but if you put these <unk> <unk> , , this is a different of of of . .
the <unk> . . that &apos;s a hard problem for reasons i don &apos;t get <unk> .
there &apos;s another thing , very interesting connection , and this is that what you want to do is to have to information to to information to a in general .
so , i think it &apos;s the the that we can probably achieve to make things .
and we decided that we should be thinking about this is really thinking about the cost of the , but in terms of simplicity .
there &apos;s a book , which is , &quot; what &apos;s the <unk> ?
so we have to ask ourselves why .
but you don &apos;t interact with people who are not as as you are .
so we can think of things like the <unk> .
i &apos;m kidding , but i just half , i i tell you that no one will believe in the the hospital if you come to with a missing an missing , , , or , or , or ,
then bell <unk> and his students .
within a few years , in the late 19th , early 20th century , the doctor was the the was trying to put a diagnosis , the <unk> .

i remember so many big , <unk> , , , , that that that to me .
some of call us <unk> , , a more a term term .
in this case , we have the . .

and there was no to <unk> .
religious <unk> .
and the thing is to move the dead to the the .
my friend simon <unk> , a <unk> , , , , the book , &quot; the the big bang . .
and now you open your eyes .
you can open it completely open , and it &apos;s <unk> .
but it was me to to that that these guys , at least most of the , what what they do for a living .
all of it was impossible .
you can generate a lot of change . you can make roads .
and that &apos;s something that people want to have .
you don &apos;t need everybody .
<unk> <unk> has <unk> <unk> <unk> and middle middle of venezuela . he was just led it .
and it &apos;s always going on .
they connect people together .
the reason , the today &apos;s a a for a 60 years of .
there &apos;s another catch .
it &apos;s it it <unk> , faster than less less than less than than than than than our our our our our for pancreatic cancer .
but my experience with the islamic world , but are very different .
there &apos;s example example , the figure out .
and why is sex to babies and why why do babies in make a erotic disaster ?
because it &apos;s the secret of the . .
especially important important to the description of the other or the other one -- that &apos;s the same -- particularly interesting is that there &apos;s no <unk> in the desire .
this is your <unk> and <unk> , that is biology , the natural instinct .
and then the desire , this is what , is curiosity , .
you know that there &apos;s a <unk> space that &apos;s every one alone .
other places in the country had similar spaces .
in a <unk> cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
ok .
that &apos;s played in smaller rooms .
so early <unk> have some <unk> .
so i asked , , ok , is this model for design , that we practice we practice ?
thank you very much .
and then he turned to me and said , &quot; well , that &apos;s me me !
how do we solve the the three problems that i want to get here to the ?
albert einstein -- i was to me with someone when i was when i was in princeton , and i was mr. einstein .
what &apos;s life is ? why am i here ?
i never never talk talk talk or a talk or a lecture .
and it was about 300 people there .
he was talking about his personal experience .
a french historian , a wrote wrote , &quot; rarely has a a of a so much of the authority of jesus christ . . &quot;
or he was what he he .
i &apos;m not going to <unk> the the <unk> of the <unk> .
but for that you have to get about 10 minutes and sit and a woman in the arm that &apos;s not there .
i was never been in .
harvest <unk> .
and tears , i said , &quot; no . &quot;
2010 , a young woman &apos;s president , and and and , and her brothers , , their parents died in war .
we go to rural areas and everything we do , what we do in this room , we create a space .
i failed failed .
i i &apos;d like to look at 20 years of and see that there &apos;s a <unk> girl , a <unk> , , <unk> girl , on on this stage .
lg : so , you .
and , , , computers can do the necessary <unk> to make insights and make choices .
every interaction is increasingly by by sensors , and , , her phone , her credit card , your computers , there &apos;s a lot data , and we get get the opportunity to understand our our .
these records were human <unk> .
by by a process process , which is a a for 40 people over three months , a very simple task for three people in 40 hours . all of the .
we should stop seeing out .
for dinner dinner with my wife and go home home .
because people say , &quot; shit , , i don &apos;t have a long deal with it ; you want to be .
she became a much more long than i thought .
this impact all all of us .
the the of national national <unk> <unk> is to our problems .
think about <unk> , <unk> .
in the era after katrina , we have more in common .
and you &apos;ve all done this , and you don &apos;t , will , you will .
help me to the green , , , help me do sustainability sexy .
so i thought , this would be a opportunity to use scratch , to make an interactive map for my mother .
but i &apos;m skeptical , which is the <unk> .
in this case , you take a <unk> , , it it up into a pile and the the of of the the of the of the characters in a game or a story , in this case , the great fish .
if you learn to code , you can make to learn to learn .
if kids are doing these kinds of projects , create these kinds of projects like variables , but it &apos;s just the beginning .
what i want to talk about today to give you a background , is the idea that cars are art .
i want to talk about that .
and i think that this idea that great cars is a soul , very useful , you know know that . you know , a car with the soul . you know how much it is .
this is one of my favorite <unk> , which is really our relationship to cars .
right ? and they decided that it it were cheaper , instead of a at and six or six or seven or seven or seven <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in in .
there was a lot of dialogue .
i think we felt very , in this day , we &apos;re very close to the , , and we <unk> the concept of real nature of true <unk> and creativity .
we didn &apos;t get to boston .
i i just have a little lab .
now we &apos;ve been clinical trials in four four of of this disease .
we don &apos;t have a team of <unk> and <unk> that that that that that to to this to the market .
100 billion the only number you have to know .
what you think about is that we have to do with a universe with a a billion galaxies , with hundred billion of stars .
what he didn &apos;t explained was why entropy is ever been low .
in contrast to low entropy of the early universe , although we don &apos;t know the answer , , we at least a a theory that can explain this , if this theory is true , and that the theory of the dark energy .
and so , even though the universe is forever , and and and and , and , , , always be certain amount of radiation , some the fluctuations , some the , even in empty space .
but there are also to be great fluctuations .
it &apos;s it . .
it &apos;s a <unk> of the the universe that accept and accept and not question .
i had never been using a computer .
it was a future that i couldn &apos;t accept .
now , i want to to to you some of the , , , , say , to the the and the poor people who are fighting with their dreams .
no matter what movement i did in my real world was only using my new new device in the digital world , eight years ago , in 2000 .
i i was very literally , i took my <unk> , and put it a little bit of <unk> that that <unk> <unk> .
the camera doesn &apos;t be not just my movements , but also can understand understand what things i think i think is in my hand .
and why just <unk> ? we can just play with . .
all of the work you &apos;ve seen about my learning in india .
this is juan , , king of spain .
this is the <unk> park in rio in year year .
again , you don &apos;t have to dig deep down the earth to create a stop .
i &apos;ll give you a short example .
so every year we have these horrible <unk> .
we &apos;re under the average in the the the in the city .

so the trick of evolution is , to make it beautiful so that you can a kind of <unk> of , so it you to to look at it .
and some are in to to to to use it for the . .
our strong response to images , the expression of feelings in art , the the of music in the night sky , and our our , and our our , as as the human race .
well , it &apos;s a quite complicated system , but let me try to explain it , and maybe i can simplify it .
so , you can see here like the computer see the environment , and because you can &apos;t see the the , , we we the the in the the , , so that he can actually see what &apos;s going on .
let &apos;s see if mark can avoid it .
or for blind people , in everyday devices in the household , in education and in the office .
a more subtle <unk> , started , the the that normal people don &apos;t hear people voices , and i heard it , i meant that something couldn &apos;t agree with me .

to <unk> <unk> : the social social change , it can &apos;t be <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we go through now .
so what i &apos;m suggesting is that is where we should look at , , to be , to be , mars , but mars , of course , a a lot more powerful and interesting place .
and the ordinary astronomers were full of of .
because it &apos;s the the of life that there can be in there , it has tremendous benefits to the life on a planet .
there was another object , this <unk> of of of of with creatures and <unk> and naked -- pretty <unk> things for a little kid .
the first projects were modest , but they took technology technology and may may be able to use the people in a new way of some new way and maybe a new function .
the other thing that is the <unk> is is that we decided to <unk> all the technology , , this whole <unk> , and tried to make it beautiful as as possible .
so we called it <unk> . . so that &apos;s another example of everything together together in a room : the three-dimensional design , the the , the ideas , the , it &apos;s all interconnected .
this is my <unk> <unk> , switzerland , he had the laptop for a afternoon , i had to go back to it . . that was hard .

ultimately , it might mean they could print their own medicine .
and if it &apos;s a , of why that &apos;s interesting , then you have to look at the rest of saudi arabia , because it &apos;s a country that is the the .
maybe some things are things things are things , and they need changes .
let me give you one example : turkey , where i come from from which is a very <unk> republic , we had something that i call the <unk> , which should protect the universities , against <unk> students .
now , if i think the only person that think that , we would have a problem .
in the 19th century , as muslims as as as like , , they were <unk> .

and we saw this guy , <unk> .
and slowly slowly , you think that are live less fun as life as normal .
so , on the expo first first , the the the , , and get a a wheel , and go through the other the other .

this is a <unk> <unk> from switzerland . switzerland , there &apos;s a national need to <unk> <unk> .
we often do little little films
what i &apos;d like to talk about , that &apos;s the biggest problems in the world .

td : lakshmi has incredibly hard to even to to my , even even , alone , everything that she has done to do that , and i was quite inspiring , and i was very nervous during this whole week .
in these two examples we have seen machines that have learned in the simulation , and and others that have learned it in the reality .
when i say , &quot; i i i my advice for <unk> .
but nobody thinks it &apos;s actually going to be very effective if there &apos;s a real outbreak .
the biggest part of the world &apos;s in in the the administration of , is actually more with with and and the threat .
we know that the is become become , it will be another virus .
but in the scientific community there is a <unk> debate about what percentage of the <unk> of <unk> people through <unk> and and and and how much about the hands .
some of the poorest countries that have the most experience of the , , <unk> of of drugs that are already gone .
and i think even our leaders in this case , say that we have a lot to do .
i &apos;m looking to answer to answer their questions .
our centers for <unk> , have one of them developed developed tests -- as as a as a quick .
and in the in the , , , , , , , , , , , , , we have a problem .
don &apos;t just look how much fun you have to do with it , but also how the <unk> <unk> are changing the way to interact with a city of the san francisco .
please put it a a with me .
i &apos;m a a a a young a of a a , and he <unk> to sell me to sell three clubs .
i i was been playing with my childhood , and , and , and , and so i , so i &apos;m . i &apos;m going to get 16 ; i &apos;m going to be
manhattan , not not to the infinite .
so i &apos;m not supposed to <unk> here , right ?
i &apos;m going to go in the middle .
she was one , i was me to the triumph .
because of the <unk> , and and branches is very dark in the <unk> and very .
i and my colleagues of <unk> <unk> are interested in the the of the the the the the the the forest .
we &apos;re <unk> with the media with <unk> ; we have a <unk> . ; we have <unk> .
and then the students have come our our our , and and have their own <unk> with their own <unk> .
and our new project is that the if we , and we &apos;re learning to grow the the frog , which is a highly highly endangered of in the states and oregon .
he said , &quot; look what you you hidden in front of you . &quot;
so we see a rising demand demand for <unk> , and so that &apos;s why so so that &apos;s why so that &apos;s why so that &apos;s why so that &apos;s why so that &apos;s
they &apos;re not a magician . they &apos;re not our parents .
you have to believe me . trust me . &quot;
and that day i learned two really important things .
the deeper we go under water , the higher is the pressure .
so i started about years ago .
the the the air is the air , , the air , the air is the the air .
each of these computer can do the entire system , so if two of them are , there are have got .
but this is what it looks like , and that &apos;s the , and over , over a lot of miles .
so sharks are not quite as dangerous as most people are them .
when we found it , we were not even sure what the family , he , so we called it <unk> up , , because he looked like it looked like his books .
the oxygen creates a <unk> and and he &apos;s <unk> .
this means that each each one of you have a a kid here , which is a a a <unk> .
and his communication and social interaction , so so that that he was a a a , and even a a <unk> .
he &apos;s something like life , if you &apos;re there , you can &apos;t get out .
i know you &apos;ve never heard of it . but notice you you a day , you &apos;ll hear you you to hear you , because he &apos;s a fascinating man . &quot;
nk : no , he &apos;s died years ago .
he had had a lot of love , he loved everybody .
we , all of us , what happens when a <unk> of hydrogen and helium as long as it &apos;s to to to to questions about their origins .
this <unk> evidence that that in many other different are there .
so you have to get the diversity , and the incredible of of life on the planet on the first step , to to to to a a with a different of life .
it &apos;s being so important as conventional , and we will going to be it in the future , by to it it to 350 antennae , so it &apos;s more sensitive to the moore &apos;s law law .
and then we &apos;d like to search the <unk> search for the <unk> .
many say , it &apos;s the best place of the world to study the climate change .
every cylinder is a <unk> of time .
as they <unk> the ice , , they <unk> a extra pair of gloves in a oven , so that they can get a new few of their their and their their their their .
i think this idea of a little bit of <unk> .
and our soldiers don &apos;t really stand to about the to of pipelines in <unk> , , when they were actually to service to <unk> american <unk> .
you can go further , and the efficiency of the <unk> with some <unk> and and the the the of the big .
we could build the cars , what would would be , but but should be easily .
but instead they sell it to china and japan , because we have to protection to our <unk> and and the others don &apos;t .
and by the the the the to the <unk> of this kind of materials , or in this case , to make <unk> <unk> , as a good <unk> , , the the , that the the the the the the the the the the the the
it can &apos;t just be a huge <unk> conspiracy .
there were two kinds of negative feedback that we have .
hope hope that it &apos;s really stable .
oops , i &apos;m wrong <unk> .
and he was an <unk> , a , a dutch <unk> named van van was who was he was a a wonderful man to a a prize that &apos;s about 10 million dollars .
according to his <unk> , , he looked like he first discovered , for the first time , there are bad in the world . &quot;
&quot; it comes . . what is it ? &quot; is a good answer .
but how attractive they find them , how they &apos;re sexually sexually or romantic , , is a important of what you think of what you think of .
but each of these three objects has a value beyond what it brings to to be a of of .
but i don &apos;t want to copy a copy , even though i can &apos;t &apos;t the difference .
so he brought joshua bell to to take his <unk> with a a station in washington d.c. , to to a a corner and see how much money he &apos;s going to take .
the second shock is less less because you &apos;re a little bit of it .
and if you &apos;re <unk> , you can see that that may be a of political <unk> .
they &apos;re <unk> that that it &apos;s a <unk> , , member of the american <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , which is very glamorous and exciting .
and what you find out is , of course , people people , the vegetables and oil , less <unk> .
the <unk> is one of the most amazing things in the world world .
it &apos;s a a <unk> end , if you &apos;re a drug in a <unk> , that that it &apos;s more side effects , and that will be able to be better .
the great the great to the real answer .
this is a problem that there is not a solution .
and very soon , they started to be that coal , , about 2,000 , , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , back to china and everywhere in the world .
can you imagine how you they would feel if you were in my point ?
it &apos;s just oil ; you know know this , all know this .
there &apos;s this thing that the the world , and the comes from the the middle of the united states .
and what do you see ? they &apos;re christians .
man , americans , somehow , , , , &quot; ah , <unk> .
these christians are <unk> .
they &apos;re . . that &apos;s wrong .
and the soldiers are chinese , and all the other are chinese .
can you imagine that one of you would put down to his child , and it and it and and she said , &quot; honey , i &apos;m a back .
everything has changed .
and all this has a huge impact on the world .
i think thomas jefferson really really really good in words .
for the <unk> , in the audience , , , , , why <unk> has a bigger budget as a <unk> , and it &apos;s because it &apos;s because it &apos;s easier to into other languages and cultures , and so the market is
but it &apos;s going to happen in this century .
this is not the <unk> of the united states , which is about a million , but but the gdp of the world per capita -- 200,000
also , like everybody here knows -- it &apos;s about energy , not oil .
my choice is the peak of a life that who started with up with the gulf coast of the gulf coast .
a lot of our action on this planet that our living environment , just believe and you us .
one has has for thousands of years of years .
we have to calm down before we go on the planet .
e.o. wilson : saving the earth earth
another another is is the famous european <unk> .
the &apos;s years of pigeon pigeon contains 1.3 billion . .
the the of the falls into this category .
real falcon from <unk> <unk> .
here &apos;s a program that is the <unk> , which is just brilliant .
this is an emotional issue . some people came up .
my grandmother was a <unk> .
i also did my own comics , that was another way to tell stories , stories , by words and by images .
and we &apos;re sitting there for a quick , in , and he said to me , &quot; you &apos;re really talented . &quot;
you your your your . draw not how you say you .
&quot; i , , , i get your <unk> .
i &apos;m also going to publish a children children &apos;s &quot; <unk> police <unk> : the <unk> who <unk> . . &quot;
sound gives us all the , , , , , , <unk> .
this is a 32 million pounds of expensive , important <unk> , that was built recently in england , designed by a british <unk> .
but it &apos;s not just children who are affected by .
people who say , don &apos;t know , the team next to this team , because noise like and the the other .
&quot; upwake &quot; tells a story about zero , a major business , , his life in a suitcase , and and the and and reality and not the situation to <unk> both .
<unk> <unk> and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and later , what was a <unk> , a <unk> of talented talented .
i know that makes us connects us .
now , the time we can use the diversity of our talents to create an intelligent , important and extraordinary work . and <unk> .
if you look around in the bathroom , you &apos;re seeing some of products more , , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , , , but also .
<unk> <unk> -- or , since the &apos; 70s , the of -- is used to to into into fold .
so , , i found <unk> .
and i said , &quot; my love , i &apos;m afraid you have a long long and <unk> year . &quot;
i told you , you should be , &quot; i &apos;m a &quot; . &quot;
they &apos;ve me me feeling , a , , in a time i felt like one one .
they &apos;re at the ninth telescope , and she started to in the , and and now the letters . .
hundreds of verbs can be so behavior .
you can see that as the language of the , or &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so the puzzle is why , , , , , , and and and so often are so much of ?
you can try to imagine what if language could be literally used literally literally used .
and the other puzzle is that i don &apos;t have a problem with this .
here &apos;s my argument . is it ? ? is it good ?
it makes it <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> .
what , what you you that , to me ?
all these different roll . can you imagine a argument that you participate in , but also in the audience , and you you ?
or -- and that &apos;s the <unk> part of me : we want to to us in the world of nature . we we can find a <unk> and find the master of of in nature that we can inspire us .
this changed everything . of this was not the the <unk> .
here &apos;s the opposite -- here is how we make things .
this is the <unk> national laboratory .
that would be <unk> for fuel cells , if you could get up without the <unk> .
it &apos;s not easy , because life uses only a <unk> of elements in the . .
and feel , is is very important .
what you don &apos;t see , you can &apos;t count .
my first business was a <unk> . i started through the taliban .
in south korea and indonesia are nearly half a million companies .
because , as the <unk> , , smaller <unk> in in the relationship to the context of the . .
and the world are not exceptions .
people people people that this <unk> and this .
i have a <unk> <unk> of of <unk> , <unk> <unk> by <unk> on my <unk> , and and i want to use paper paper to <unk> it .
we we got it to it .
what does that mean ?
when i started to to them , i found that they have really really amazing .
but they had a problem .
until eventually , they did their and and the campus -- and sure happy were , to get there , a some time back back and and , and that the crows came
we &apos;ve found that they really really smart , and they can teach each other .
for example , , , come back to the and and go .
but there were three problems , three puzzles , which i could not solve , and i want to talk about it , but importantly , i found a a . .
who would ever put me ? &quot;
and imagine what could happen , because any region has to offer something .
let me make the connection .
you know that the the of the future is is the future . you need to understand that .
it &apos;s a lot to <unk> .
oh , i &apos;m going to be the johnny &apos;s of the sound .
there &apos;s about 10 million <unk> .
and over here , , in the words of the , israel , &quot; like the hand in a way that we &apos;re in in a way that <unk> . .
and she said , &quot; yes , but i &apos;d rather to eat , if you don &apos;t have anything about it . &quot;
i said , &quot; you should make an experiment .
he had a line in his book that said said that <unk> from the <unk> , , there was a <unk> maria <unk> who had had the with with .
so now you have an evolutionary excuse .
she said -- i have to read you what she said , because i think it &apos;s so beautiful .
i think that very unfortunate . not because i would have to use it . i wanted to see him .
and that &apos;s actually the beginning of our history .
now i i &apos;d been thought to that moment that the age of 50 , one of the skills i really was really to to my my shoes .
first of first , i have to tell you that i &apos;m not here .
yes . the artist doesn &apos;t seem to know where to know where it &apos;s to to the different colors .
but i can see in their faces , they &apos;re still a bit bit of skeptical .
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> , &quot; and i think that &apos;s just . .
after a while i decided to have fun fun , and before i left the room room i i i a few things in the room .
and now you &apos;re all here here .
my father was one , my youth was so interesting .
the song as a fact .
and i , &quot; moment , , , i &apos;m going to put the wheels , i &apos;m bought the wheels , i bought the the wheels , and i did them and i and i , and i , i i , i i do my <unk> ?
it just sounds , but i think that we have in in society and culture with the <unk> of the .
he had designed the <unk> self , and he was really proud of it .
human , i love the thing .
the follow of the planet that living seven billion people .
so particularly very proud of the <unk> , , the the <unk> , which he had to his his <unk> , and and the beautiful <unk> around the seat .
intent -- a life of intent -- hard , a a a a a .
i saw the healthy mass of a left , and i was that it was lost , <unk> all of the i didn &apos;t done , but not nothing .
then then i started to ask many many times of , to ask how my life would have been other , if that man had &apos;t hurt me if my genes had a different deal of experience .
i i was , but i was despite despite a <unk> of , i , i , i i , i i myself .
i had something much deeply to , this <unk> <unk> <unk> to to four words and and me to go back to my way .
he spent six months in prison , lost his <unk> for for a decade .
yes , contrast .
we &apos;re working at the <unk> laboratory laboratory at the university of california , san diego . .
one , the perception of people , and second , a natural called called a natural called a natural form of the , so that the interaction with the robot to the .
and yet , i got this idea to own .
after after i realized this economic risk , i thought , we we need to find a solution to this problem .
some of the , in the , in the , , like , like this , , , , the the of tim tim , that which which which as a be .
i know i don &apos;t know tedtalk that involves that .
this time , i paid 25 cents , because i found was a little thing difficult .
and yet , there was one thing that all were safe , the , to be slow down .
keep the mystery of the dark energy in the head , because i &apos;m going to give you three <unk> of string theory .
the <unk> <unk> up on about 10 to 500 .
and he was decades of it to explain this number , but he didn &apos;t have success , and we know why .
each of these universes has extra dimensions .
because the astronomers of today by by to to the to the the sky , a a handful of <unk> photons -- a kind of <unk> <unk> , , , , years .
now , i want to be honest with you and tell you that the most of it is a trick , but a trick actually works .
remember , it &apos;s the first time you &apos;re making it . we want to really get and and and more more .
he said , &quot; go , milo . <unk> . &quot;
pm : this is dimitri so right in <unk> .
we don &apos;t know anybody here .
the next moment , the phone doesn &apos;t work , the the , , , , , are are on the street .
it was a very <unk> meeting the reporters who worked in war , employees employees , and of of , of course , the brave , brave people of
if i i &apos;m asked why i &apos;m going to get to , why i &apos;m going to stay , that &apos;s the reason .
but it &apos;s my job of this this , and this is the <unk> , the the of the , for us .
even before a goal that that you could the the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the the the the goal , no matter where it is .
so we basically <unk> the animals , so they were learned to study this <unk> and objects and objects in the world .
in an experiment we did a few years ago we went to the limit .
so we start in china .
so , <unk> had the the <unk> .
please raise your hand .
the last reason has to do with that women are the solution , not the problem .
in in , in the , of seven women in the birth of a child .
it became part of the solution , not the problem .
larry <unk> , when he was <unk> as a <unk> of the world bank , once said , &quot; it can be good that investments in the in the developing the the the the the highest <unk> . &quot;
this is bill <unk> &apos;s book .
and that was the feather of a bird .
this whole of of the <unk> of our <unk> tells us that there is a <unk> . .
and even this image makes the have the have the have to be the , -- like something from the <unk> &amp; amp ; <unk> .
one of these ways that we could have to put into a little <unk> .
they put their their and say , &quot; i want to to this <unk> for against <unk> we share 50 50 . &quot;
there are places places where they can all put all three or four or to a new language .
when 27 individuals from this 27 to to a table , put their 23 languages , they just tell you a a of a <unk> of <unk> <unk> to need to be prepared for all the <unk> possibilities .
but it doesn &apos;t tell us that it &apos;s also about language .
and what i &apos;m interested in the is the invisible space between a text and the and and the the image , and the the is changing the text and the text through the image .
these are <unk> <unk> <unk> that will go over the the the the ocean and north north america .
they &apos;re the negative .
but by the sense of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> can change the .
larry <unk> was sitting 20 years of a half a sentence in arizona , in arizona , and <unk> <unk> a <unk> of a <unk> a <unk> .
from that , people from people to themselves .
and they &apos;ve brought them up to texas .
and they go to the <unk> to the the <unk> where it &apos;s in this moment .
it &apos;s just the amount of space that it it it as as not would &apos;t .
so &apos;s what you call to a feeling : the pursuit of happiness and human design .
in part is the the the legacy , the <unk> , which was the for for <unk> , , it &apos;s going to be by <unk> aspects of the individual and and can &apos;t be found .
a <unk> of the is happiness is happiness and <unk> don &apos;t <unk> <unk> in a <unk> . .
it starts in the <unk> <unk> .
here &apos;s a three weeks old .
in the animal kingdom , there is only one possibility of the status , that is dominance .
i want to close with some of .
why would you choose rats ?
once the rat had it , we make it a little bit .
you can actually heal , , even people who are hiv-positive .
with know that a patient that is more microscopic , , to 15 people infected -- 15 healthy people -- a year , you can be sure that we &apos;ve saved a lot of lives .
here we see neurons .
so it &apos;s important for imitation and <unk> .
now the question is : if i just watch another person , , why am i not confused , and i literally , this <unk> of the the , how do you touch ?
thank you . i have two two two two .
i really not not about the <unk> , but it &apos;s the pollen .
all these pictures were taken by a <unk> <unk> by the by the way , in the the lab .
even every one of us has a a story to tell us a story of the . .
we have to be as good as the breast cancer campaign to address this crisis .
right at the time , in the 1980s , when we were to and and through heart disease , and they got a an for the new england journal of medicine and called the <unk> . .
our colleagues in washington , d.c.
we decided , &quot; let &apos;s look at this . &quot;
unlike <unk> , x-ray , <unk> , <unk> , for women , their <unk> , the the , every time we organize something that , a a lot of radiation , we , , &quot; is that test really necessary ? &quot;
okay , here we started .
they &apos;ve done what they said , they were <unk> and they were also .
the cells have something like <unk> ; they &apos;re not to to .
what does that mean for us ?
in the the of three years we took eight eight hours 10 hours , we raised about a <unk> hours of <unk> and <unk> .
this is one of the first <unk> that that came out more than a year ago that that really really really really . us .
and finally , my son gets alone in a <unk> . .
three of the most important people in this project philip <unk> , <unk> and and <unk> roy are here .
and there &apos;s a fascinating dynamic in the game .
this is the first time our son has more than two steps on time -- -- in the film .
and this is a important to a question , because the better we understand how the brain , , the better , better better , we better better , and i think , the better , we can think and work .
it &apos;s a way of where you see a picture and think , &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional reaction to the the . . &quot;
what we literally do is to paint our team <unk> our our to to a a a a a .
that &apos;s the first house i built .
it &apos;s not just about , but also , but it &apos;s also to the the for . .
so there &apos;s not a .
if you bring that into the industry industry , if you have a <unk> and a window , and we &apos;ll say , &quot; oh , &quot; oh no , that &apos;s broken , that must be fixed .
that &apos;s the difference .
so we &apos;re it . .
are we just stupid ?
you might have been through two years of the , , , , , .
so she can in september , and say , &quot; i &apos;m important today .
why don &apos;t you do that , and why do you do not do that ? &quot;
and the police waiting for the the of the fire fire to to make the vehicle in the to run the body .
and that &apos;s enough to the the present in the united states , which is one eye of the <unk> .
all of this leads us -- <unk> , just to to name : what what we &apos;re most to do is to use digital devices .
this is the consequence of the destruction of more than a third of the brain on the the on the .
this is a very , very very , level to get out of the health system .
he then gave my jaw in the right position while he <unk> my teeth .
alfred , is a brilliant physicist and and , who &apos;s fascinated fascinated in the gaps in consciousness , whether he &apos;s a deaf <unk> , or a blind , or a a , , the
now i had to put in the dark the dark the dark years , when everything that i was , what was been , , was gone .
and it works . it works .
<unk> : so if you have the opportunity , they spend time with simon .
and these were the developing countries : they had big families and a small .
and they are on this side , a big <unk> of africa and and the <unk> of africa and the .
and then deng xiaoping came and brought money to china and and it back to a middle of it .
a search search that we can copy the data in a <unk> scale and we can publish the world , and what do we hear when we &apos;re looking around ?
but this creates hypotheses . .
you know , darwin has this explains after it , , what was the essence of life ?
and there i i i francis crick .
but there were the in the literature .
we were not the best chemist in the room .
i was unhappy , my girls didn &apos;t coming to . .
you can be just that dna and dna and and it to it .
and so i close by telling you that we have people with schizophrenia .
average average , the defense of the one , two million dollars and they take 18 months when they win .
first , they didn &apos;t fight against the patent against the patent .
my solution : give me this patent , and i &apos;m going to leave them with <unk> .
&quot; why not ? &quot; they asked the girls .
the fathers were in a place where they move their daughters to play their , their their their own own own .
this is a great technology .
it &apos;s not a lot left on the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in people .
can the enemy of the the of the time , and we took a different different way to we we we had to to the that we had had the smallpox .
it has helped to control pandemic pandemic , , sars , for example .
the reality of polio today is something different .
and yet , the impossible happened .
bill gates : now bruce , where are the most difficult places ?
bruce <unk> : how we get polio
dj : so we found this <unk> <unk> now in all kinds of animals , especially in the big thing .
and to our surprise , it was a <unk> .
for us , this elephant , in a lot of , a a symbol of inspiration , a symbol of hope that that we follow us our work .
it was incredibly amazing than it took it in security to protect it from the . .
and of course , if i look at this <unk> of that , , she &apos;s me a a a a a of a human hand , and that &apos;s ironic because your destiny is in our
we need it . we respect and respect each other as a man and a woman , a community and and a a of this planet and we have to continue on .
but , it &apos;s clearly the earth is big , and the the sun is small and and , , but it &apos;s worth of what <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s because in middle middle of the &apos;s always there .
nature &apos;s this model depends on the kind of animal we are .
because there &apos;s so many of them , and because there are no any any any any any of their <unk> , <unk> , , the <unk> , as we see in world world , <unk> and . .
people people as be scientifically and <unk> , , but it &apos;s a <unk> time when you want to guess what the question of the person are doing next .
over night i was the <unk> <unk> in the the the age of 40 .
i &apos;m with a moving , i &apos;m going to my head , , allow me to to see video of the robots and to to by by by by by by the buttons .
with the help of people like we can do this dream .
in , , , , , a <unk> of a <unk> of the <unk> , by basically the the the the the the dolphins ,
i think together , we can form a global community .
this is a hot <unk> <unk> .
there are some few -- there are some lessons that can learn from from .
but usually don &apos;t do that .
i think we we to to to this : the infrastructure infrastructure of globalization .
this is to 12 to 15 percent 15 percent .
this is a problem that we need to solve .
i also suppose most of you also don &apos;t talk chinese -- what really really really is really sad when you think that this is the most common language on the internet .
what what do you look at ? maybe we should do that .
if you look at this image , you might think , &quot; why should this be interested in ? &quot;
but there &apos;s all these different techniques that allow you to to go out and look at the world and find its place in it .
they would bring wealth and security , religious violence and make sure that states never never <unk> .
and part of this activity is honesty .
what is this ?
i love this dish .
and the war , , 20 million people took life -- to the civil war war .
<unk> <unk> , who &apos;s this guy , &quot; i &apos;d have been able to do all this money , but i &apos;ve spent all of time to look at the man who my my recipe .
the restaurants restaurants have mostly done the same thing , i would argue with the <unk> and the <unk> -- even without without a fibonacci . .
in contrast , we have a general tso chicken that in in new york city in the early 1970s when i was in in new york city in new york city in new city in the early 1970s , so ...
so what we &apos;re in in the in the <unk> , the <unk> search for medicine of <unk> , which creates the same thing .
so people would have a really great <unk> .
when the <unk> began to be less , i was been <unk> , i i thought , until i thought , my god , i can &apos;t work work .
do you remember that as a child to to to ?
at 18 and 19 , i went to night .
and again , i &apos;m going to be bit depressed and and .
so many of us is that there &apos;s a lot of to do in the next years , in the world &apos;s a better world .
he goes around , &quot; how does it feel to be free ? &quot;
you know , where did the world the the the the the problems that the the the of the the and and climate change ?
if you &apos;re the impossible , you you it it .
but we &apos;ve a a agreement to climate change .
and god god .
the <unk> power makes something remarkable : they used two ingredients , proteins and water that are in their , to create a material that which is as a than than than than than the .
or you &apos;re <unk> beautiful things like this , if the camera can be that .
you see see it it &apos;s taken off the tissue .
with my new project , <unk> <unk> , i want to use art to create technology .
there &apos;s also a microphone that &apos;s the the and and and and the and the <unk> -- hopefully -- hopefully not to help him to help some of their .
what should i do ? &quot;
the the of this , , , <unk> <unk> , , a a , a <unk> , , a <unk> -- -- it &apos;s the feedback of the audience , and the feedback of the , and the answer to the . . works that thing ?
stanley haidt , inventor of the known <unk> <unk> <unk> , , in the <unk> and <unk> , that there are two people people to only one connection to seven to seven .
how does our view think of all the to groups of the
now , there was a <unk> that i &apos;m going to tell you and where where he would have been able to put that in the ear .
um ... my father , a <unk> ?
it was his father who decided she they were false false .
this sense of responsibility of life , the other of the , , of 17 years of 17 years , and he also a to to a a <unk> , he was from a camp , his friends were his his his his his
and as my <unk> and my <unk> and , and , , , , , did my dad did false papers .
i asked him , in the the of the victims he had ever ever that .
we &apos;re going to grow out of a million people on seven billion people we are today .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> level , which is a a <unk> of the next that that seem to be a good condition .
if you <unk> the forests , the the the the the the the , you <unk> the ability to stay stable .
with the insight of <unk> , , , the <unk> great <unk> <unk> <unk> and scientists , the great barrier reef is <unk> is the the current .
but the drama is of course , that is that that that that is not a option .
so that brings me to another reason i am here today : because i really like that .
this is a <unk> of of a <unk> <unk> .
first , he &apos;s an ancient kind of making the <unk> , and connected this with a three-dimensional perspective , which was a new technology at that time .
and through the of of sugar black , i became portraits of them .
it became very large images , and i took them with a very big camera , a a camera camera .
my interest in <unk> , especially worse , , , very enough .
and then , back , the is a sequence that also as the chimpanzees .
we can ask , is there <unk> difference between africans and <unk> ?
and then you can compare it to the genome of living today .
we can then do the the the same questions , like neanderthals : have you have with ancestors of people &apos;s ancestors ?
there are many people who have their own vision , for example , this vision of the 20th century .
after my belief , the airplane of the future of your own consciousness .
imagine , , they grow in the 3d printer , and are in a a <unk> , and follow the forces that in in their components .
they didn &apos;t talk . yet , especially were been extraordinary isolated from the world around them , from their environment and from the people .
they would <unk> . they would call the police .
now we know it &apos;s about about 100 .
you see a video .
you have the feel that research that research that you really , , really , a effect that can actually prevent these experiences that i had started my way to this area .
you you take off .
<unk> <unk> you in a on your -- chin on the <unk> , arms <unk> on your <unk> .
they did everything that we did it .
and after the battle , they bring this mobile , and and what what what what what you call &quot; <unk> &quot; to teach you what you &apos;re wrong .
the people have changed .
i asked , &quot; where is he ? ? &quot;
this is not a . .
and she showed up on the left , to tell me how about this picture was that this that was been to with the idea of the , like the way .
it &apos;s really in this sense sense that i have a new series of questions i i i .
well , there &apos;s an obvious statement .
and the kids said , &quot; how to do we do . &quot;
i think they &apos;re going to try and multiply the .
so i said , &quot; how long you you you before you decided you you have anything you you ? &quot;
their <unk> was up 50 , what otherwise , in a <unk> , , it &apos;s a <unk> .
was 76 percent . the test , two months later , the result was 76 percent .
after after ted , , , he wanted to be <unk> da vinci .
that &apos;s the . .
and i i made the the of the the the of the the of the space of the place of the that was the the the moon .
if i had to reduce the whole story of a picture , which is it ?
i &apos;m going to show you some of from my other big , this year , &quot; the completely .
and our little life ends up in a sleep .
bono : &quot; they &apos;re <unk> .
i know you understand that .
so , blue , blue , everything was blue .
i want to tell you two stories . both play in africa .
it &apos;s another that &apos;s in the interface of health and business .
let &apos;s use the markets as the <unk> <unk> that we have , and find out what cost people would pay for it so that they would have the choice .
thank you .
the <unk> was was that if my mother could &apos;t understand it , we could &apos;t use it in the video .
we destroyed two two and and 10 television .
the little <unk> to to take out of of his and and that was a problem .
this is pretty good . it &apos;s slowly .
i &apos;d like to show you a video of the models of the models i work with .
and tissue by <unk> density and behavior is the second part , and that &apos;s actually the key to use to use these models for <unk> .
thank you .
and the attempt to fly fly it was like to to to to the to the the the the end end , and it was hard work , and young , , i &apos;ve learned a lot of respect
now let &apos;s take the the other side .
we &apos;re working on projects -- even <unk> developments , as <unk> as <unk> -- <unk> -- with a <unk> institute of technology and the university of los angeles .
be careful , just behave like like like like like like like like like .
now i i &apos;m not trying to be <unk> .
they go forever forever .
these are over two billion .
it &apos;s going to be able to say it , &quot; three years of <unk> . &quot;
forget not forget that one .
but it &apos;s great because it &apos;s a metaphor for the time , where we live in where we can in in the human and and machines together .
i &apos;m clear from it . where did you come from ?
it &apos;s too afraid that the way in the wild in 20 to 20 to 20 years .
all the evidence that that cancer is going cancer from a virus .
i took the opportunity to opportunity and i took a a samples from jonas , , and a few samples from from other body . .
she brought him to the the and and this discovered something .
and , cancer is a a of of ability to share our cells and to to to and to to .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and that &apos;s a global phenomenon .
they would be <unk> to wait for it .
and that is the third reason why a low &apos;t &apos;t make us happy .
but they didn &apos;t felt that the numbers on them .
first i &apos;m going to show you the <unk> of for the optimism bias .
but the good news is that the illusion is not broken when we &apos;re aware of this <unk> .
but what we &apos;re seeing in the 21st century is asia , comes comes to to to to to more than half the world &apos;s population , to the world of the world .
you could look this as the of of the . .
after visited the smith smith , , was called &quot; this is the end of america . &quot;
if you live in japan or or or or or <unk> , your view of china &apos;s going to be something different than it &apos;s going to be different in beijing .
and when we have strategies in we we we we to be able to do this process .
how do we define our national interests , so it &apos;s not just a <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
this is the conventional approach approach .
this has typically the responsibility for the to to a stable <unk> .
they &apos;re on on the .
jobs for who ? for young men .
after the the the the the the , , you can &apos;t even get land .
the care of the to the the conflict , the , , , government .
this is the the of my hometown of new orleans .
the military has it . they call the climate change , the the of the security and stability , governments as governments in the world to how to react .
it allows you to be productive , so that they can afford to afford the insurance .
these are are inspiring to see , our solutions , we can feel able to plan to be a world world .
listen like chinese students practice in in .
teacher : perfect ! students ! perfect !
and that includes things like the concrete world with <unk> <unk> , to use , we try to make logical consistent , and we also take the hypothetical serious , we we &apos;re actually to what what is .
and looked at before they went into the scientific age , and he found that these people are resistant to a a of the the .
&quot; said , &quot; the north pole is always snow .
they chose <unk> instead of new york .
it wasn &apos;t just the spread of cognitively <unk> .
would you have it killed ? &quot;
you might say , a circle half .
it feels like i landed in a colony of angels . &quot;
and they &apos;re me to a a in anything .
it &apos;s still in the red numbers , but chris made it with personal , , this film .
i &apos;m one of their <unk> .
there &apos;s a prime minister , <unk> , <unk> , and a <unk> , or president of the <unk> .
boy : &quot; the <unk> is serious .
we were all angry down to them , &quot; why are you doing that ?
it &apos;s going to read it a lot of real when you read it . &quot;
we &apos;ve been the the time after after weeks , , , , seven weeks , and we basically , all 50 <unk> <unk> crisis .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
many people were doing good for jobs and <unk> the the .
it &apos;s like his own small connection .
if i &apos;m all three legs from the three legs of the triangle , i would get a <unk> . .
so all you do is -- it &apos;s a very <unk> case -- this old <unk> , and old <unk> , and this old <unk> is very simple in an old <unk> .
that is possible if you have a whole piece of paper , <unk> paper paper -- you can be in a school school or a a , a a , a a , a pen , a pen , no glue , no glue , no glue .
what we do is a very simple <unk> .
this is a little bit of what you do is , is these two corners here here , it &apos;s going to be like a <unk> .
here are two magnets .
there were very many passengers on the ship , and they were boring , so the captain of the .
at the <unk> conference , <unk> <unk> , simple and and amazing plans to to waste waste in really <unk> , , , , and , and are doing children , they can build themselves -- as they learn
it was a big challenge , and it was actually examples of biology that were given a lot of evidence .
and there are some examples of projects to be to to to of . .
and with a little planning , we can transform a place of traffic , into into a , of open space for people who gives people to food and and and put waste into together together .
this photograph is made the day after the , and just one year later , it looked like this .
when you <unk> seawater , the first one of the <unk> is the calcium calcium .
no , you have to explore people people &apos;s <unk> with with the . .
i was looking for someone who is jewish because because i &apos;m jewish , and i &apos;m very important .
but the real thing was was that there was a lot of men who wanted to go out with me .
very few of us have the ability to be be be honest with themselves .
he would like to go as long as it &apos;s not on a <unk> . .
i tried to be like <unk> .
because you remember my <unk> , , you have to achieve a <unk> of of 700 points , and nobody did .
most of you . <unk> are 33 years old , years old , not eight years , and when we look at the <unk> demographics of the <unk> , , the the of of the , the .
imagine that vision is very , very , very good .
and even the <unk> , even many other benefits in ways , and , and a aspect of attention , and a of attention that is also , our ability to our our ability to our objects .
i want to ask you to ask you to get this result , and it in the context of another group of <unk> , a group that actually looked up in our society that are are of people who are working . .
let me explain this step explain a task that called mental mental . .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
let &apos;s just just all the the programs of the special that we look at .
so it was a big , very very complex project , i didn &apos;t even even sure if it works at all .
so wolfram alpha knows know many many and many of things .
on the one hand , we have mathematica , with the kind of <unk> , <unk> language and a major network of <unk> developed capacity , capable of able to do a lot of lines of
so , physical <unk> , we &apos;re kind of used to to go to the world and see that certain materials make sense of certain for for , and so on .
a few years ago , i was quite excited about the discovery that there are candidates with incredibly simple rules that that is really a of relativity of relativity and and and gravity and gravity and gravity and the of the quantum mechanics .
sw : i think i think .
and during that time , i actually lost more other , and and , and teachers that me , to hiv / aids .
they jump up . they wear red clothing .
since my mother was a woman , she didn &apos;t have any right of land and automatically , everything my family , , knew the the , , he was right .
and the day before the actual ceremony , we were got , , and had all night all night .
he was wearing and and in a village that didn &apos;t even even even even <unk> streets . it worked very attractive .
i promised him to be a <unk> girl , i would come back and do everything they would to me .
when the marriage marriage was pregnant before the , was was made for it and and .
while we &apos;re talking , 125 of minutes , will never be <unk> .
consumers that represent 72 percent of american <unk> , , actually start to start <unk> like banks and companies <unk> <unk> , their their , in daily , in their daily lives , to the and and that we if we move forward .
and what you &apos;ve at here is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we actually actually <unk> and and basically future , the future children children our homes .
<unk> are up to 48 percent of the after the after after the .
we &apos;re also seeing a trend to something <unk> . . right ?
one of them is the <unk> of community and neighborhood , and more more on the neighbors than support .
we &apos;re also a big <unk> .
the is is is is is is .
and then we take the phenomenon of <unk> .
and then the the question , i am the only thing that does ?
you could exploit it .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing in my life -- stories tell them , novels , and today i want to to share with you a couple stories about the art of storytelling , and some of creatures , the <unk> .
our <unk> is to be , . our hearts could be <unk> , and our our <unk> could be <unk> when we &apos;re on on long of our cultural <unk> .
and i i the first time i i call it , &quot; &quot; . . &quot;
i &apos;m not a <unk> , no refugee or <unk> , i &apos;m i &apos;m going to do that . but the &apos;s the to to to to to to .
he wanted to see a manifestation of my identity .
my tiny story was became a huge issue , because i was <unk> .
literature has to lead us to the other side .
i could be a a a a muslim woman , and maybe a happy story , and , and in my next book , i i about a <unk> , <unk> professor in norway .
so you &apos;re . you have already , existing songs , cut it into small piece , shapes that piece , , , and you get a new song , and you get a new song , but this new song is clearly made out of old songs
instead , these laws and laws of the world world the world of property property .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , , but i &apos;m going to discover what it &apos;s . . <unk> alarm : the <unk> of the telephone , by a symbol of a symbol .
our creativity is from outside , not from the .
and then they say , &quot; okay , but how do you understand it address ? &quot;
in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the newspaper .
what &apos;s beautiful , you can probably see this limb , a kind of <unk> <unk> , almost <unk> that out of the limb .
our our of the solar system taught us that the solar solar solar .
now , this led to a understanding of the nuclear structure , because it &apos;s so <unk> that atoms have a only core , with <unk> that the .
this picture shows a galaxy , a <unk> , , , , , 100 billion stars like our sun .
i think it can also end up the the ideas of the ideas of us , in the universe , and really value of our home planet .
this is at home . this is at home . we are .
and with every and every , and every touch of the screen , we &apos;re <unk> and <unk> of our personal information all around our way through the digital forests .
when our daughter put on the <unk> , , i asked her , &quot; is going to do much much much much much ?
we can &apos;t also <unk> this this .
well , i want to take you to this journey .
and because i was so much about and i , i decided to my 27 birthday i i couldn &apos;t speak , i &apos;d be a day -- a day .
and they don &apos;t talk ?
and i explained to help a friend of friend , my sign of my sign i i was i was that i was life that i was going to and that this was the last time that somebody was to my sign stage .
well , i &apos;m my my backpack .
i started to talking talking to talk , because i had studied <unk> .
but the <unk> thing was that i was to me on my birthday , , but never about my decision , to to my my .
born , and i grew up in north korea .
sometimes i i found a little jobs in for against food .
i was doing i &apos;m i was to be <unk> and back back .
i felt so controversial , because i had so much to food , but my father had died of hunger .
but i believe that their gesture of love and care of the life of a different joseph , and will change thousands of other <unk> that can still change the hope .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials for building building , but this was much more much more than i had expected and make a and and and to make an industrial <unk> .
but then i was very disappointed with my job as because because we don &apos;t help , we don &apos;t work for society , but for people , , , , , , , , , , .
and then in the year , there , there was a big earthquake in in in in .
so i ask , what is a <unk> and what a <unk> building ?
but this is really needed .
so we learn some of the most important things in our lives before we &apos;re born , in the womb .
so fetuses are even learning the certain language that is talked in the world that will be born in the world .
it creates a mixture of that that are as as as as as the woman .
why should malnutrition lead to the the in the womb ?
but you can see <unk> , but you see .
this trust in the <unk> is is a <unk> of of <unk> . .
the audience are going to <unk> <unk> , which are quite logical , but not with what &apos;s going on your your eyes . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a good story , it brings us to smile .
you may remember the the <unk> <unk> , , ok , the the biggest deal of all time .
if you &apos;re a high animal in the , and someone says , &quot; what does you do to do for the in the world ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we start an ad campaign ?
this is actually a strategy , and i &apos;m not going to see that strategy is a role .
for me , all music was .
now , i i use my , the camera , the camera , and it &apos;s the the the of the in the to the <unk> , and you have a a system .
i remember the poor needed something <unk> -- food -- food , clothes -- not -- they didn &apos;t .
i even felt a <unk> of shame .
now , i heard him , i was excited about different reasons .
i didn &apos;t even asked a a a a , , which normally my way .
it &apos;s about the the of of the the , and it &apos;s about a to a way to able to put what would would say , a partnership , doesn &apos;t actually <unk> a a that can be on a traditional kind of donation , can can happen
it &apos;s a very <unk> <unk> , a very powerful combination .
now , is the <unk> is at the beginning , and it &apos;s <unk> , for me , very clear that it &apos;s just a vehicle , just a a .
what is the future of humanity ?
now i &apos;m going to turn to second great question : are we alone , or are there other life in the universe ?
the answers to these big questions that we &apos;ve done remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
now look at this .
here &apos;s photos of me .
the rate is doubled every 18 months and every single <unk> member of the <unk> , knows that is the <unk> law .
but what about you ? what will it going to do with them ?
they &apos;re in in their <unk> , and occasionally you people to experiments that their parents would not agree .
so we &apos;re interested in these things like this .
and then generations , these these experiments could not do this .
and what i found out that the first technology was <unk> a <unk> of <unk> million years ago .
we can learn a lot of it .
and i see <unk> and and i try to protect my child , because with a child you don &apos;t you any one , even a minister .
and secondly , they told us that she had a <unk> gang , but some of the <unk> of the trees .
until now , our our our our our ancestors , , by adults adults , the the , the fossils , the <unk> , .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the the of of human ethiopia , and he talks about how he found the oldest skeleton of a <unk> of a a , and what we can learn in africa .
and if all of the the rules , , you need to have a effective system to the and and the and and , and we have found in all of , , is also .
it &apos;s looking at as high high , because the continent of <unk> <unk> was <unk> .
we need to work , but also the whole <unk> of <unk> .
we need to create a new paradigm of of and respect respect respect respect respect .
carol <unk> says , &quot; i would pay numbers to do what i do . &quot;
so that was a quite good idea .
to say it clear , i &apos;m a journalist , i &apos;m a , , so i want to design a case , like the present and the future will look .
and i i think , we have to think about it , we we want to think that that is going to reality -- and if what it means for our idea of life and and for everything that comes out .
it looks like oil oil .
the symptoms of the complex are that you have the strong and <unk> , , the the right solution , matter how hard the problem is .
cesar and i tried to write an article for the new york times and and how it works .
of course , we can .
and make a lot of money .
it &apos;s higher than the the of americans .
we &apos;re going to try . it &apos;s probably all wrong .
<unk> immediately . . &quot;
and was it over again , but he could never prove the guess .
i i want that to say that our approach is just not . .
china wants to have done in 20 years .
we don &apos;t even even further down .
the future is <unk> <unk> .
yes , it will going to be ugly , and yes , it &apos;s going to be -- -- in our lifespan -- but we &apos;re more than able to overcome everything that comes
and here &apos;s where they come in .
and what we need to think about is this is : when you stand into the fire , what &apos;s next ?
and we thought we can make this debt on our children , but imagine you .
everything else is <unk> .
this is the financial crisis .
students wanted to know in what the the the cell .
it should be been amazing , right ?
all we get is <unk> .
you can be able to be able to be able to be the the , or or can can &apos;t do a series of things that we can &apos;t .
that &apos;s not a thousand years in the distance .
we should show this cheap , and and and and don &apos;t to to your their children . &quot;
and here we can see this this average .
we can &apos;t risk to lose the trust of the clients .
he has only got 500 500 and and to to 1,000 . &quot;
and he had a huge high amount of <unk> <unk> who got them , and he said , &quot; come back in a week , if you &apos;re sick . &quot;
the internet , as we know it , the kind of the web -- the things we &apos;re all talking about -- is a less than 5,000 days old .
of course , the internet has been the internet for more than 5,000 days -- the web is just 5,000 days .
so if we say , the machine that we &apos;re now a <unk> , a human brain , a human brain when we look at the rate , there &apos;s in 30 years of six years .
now it &apos;s not like -- if you can a a chart and things at work , a word document , they &apos;re not part of the web but you &apos;re going to be . they will be part of the machine .
i say , &quot; people will be the the senses of the machine . &quot; in a sense sense .
it &apos;s going to the level of parts or or words , if you want to say .
the last thing i wanted to talk about is the idea we &apos;re going to be .
thirdly , it becomes more ubiquitous ubiquitous to our entire environment , and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within a week , i was convinced that the second <unk> of jesus christ happened was that it was a <unk> moon , and that was a <unk> of god and prepared to be prepared for his <unk> .
these are the dead of <unk> .
and it it everything . it makes all sense .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple ideas , we things .
this is a project that we &apos;ve done in a major <unk> of , that &apos;s happened from this process , it &apos;s the result of a of forces that it .
and that led to the another project .
it &apos;s actually a false attitude , because the is probably likely to be more interesting .
i &apos;m interested in how these ideas are people to people .
and finally , one of the most interesting projects , the <unk> .
each of of you is about to your neighbors .
so , we have to pay for school .
so we have a big brain , a big advantage , because we can influence our environment .
my story , the &apos;s the two brains . it may surprise you , our gut has a <unk> brain .
this is is very , very important , because there can be <unk> .
we have learned to talk with the big brain , taste , reward , as you know .
he said , &quot; you know , at some point , we were all like animals and then not . . &quot;
these are men and women who can even find even 250 stars in the night sky .
of course , the <unk> of the are told that .
the <unk> , the post that the sun is , is actually a <unk> , the the the the the the the the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , , <unk> <unk> .
if you pray for dead dead , you do with the hands hands , you you the the in the sky .
here &apos;s the place where the big mother the the the the the the the the the mountains and the country , which is the the heart of the world .
it &apos;s unique <unk> of human imagination .
this material that you all know , is <unk> , but i think it &apos;s more rather for toxic <unk> .
i i put in in there , you can see in in a hundred years , my body can come back to the the earth .
it &apos;s a <unk> . .
you want to use it all over the world , not to to take <unk> or <unk> or you have a very for .
first they &apos;re in in a special bottle .
i got a competition in four years ago , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my country is a to to 15 trillion dollars .
and that is -- -- that &apos;s even more <unk> than all the speakers from me and all of those who get to me .
and she thought about my work in mathematical models that should understand understanding of evolution and modern genetics .
the other half of the audience may &apos;t be -- from , , cultural reasons , it &apos;s for boring -- and find another pattern of a more interesting than the .
you can think about it two ways .
if you throw a coin , you get a a of head and number .
back to more likely to <unk> , because of which of of of .
and only one percent , you .

our think going on .
by a a change change change , change , like transparency , change , change , like <unk> , and collaboration , to do collaboration , not <unk> , these things are focused on results .
because the the the the the the the the things that things are always done for us , the the the of rid of the old <unk> and and new creative solutions for the problems of
because we can &apos;t do it alone . we should do it together and if we do it , and if we do that , and the ideas of play , we can transform bulgaria to something to

rg + : thank you .
i &apos;m start with glenn gould .
i started with the experience .
there &apos;s such a of of &quot; star trek . &quot;
we &apos;ve all seen this &quot; star <unk> with the <unk> .
imagine , big , already , to hear the <unk> today , like they were . john <unk> walker shows how to be the the and and <unk> , and can be analyzed on <unk> wings .
now , since we &apos;ve seen a time of extraordinary extraordinary <unk> , the longest in the history of this country .
but now , a few months later , how well politicians might be in , &quot; in the <unk> apple , &quot; the mine , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; how it &apos;s , , , , they can &apos;t hide .
well , i didn &apos;t really understand that until i met this guy , a <unk> , , a <unk> , which was <unk> by <unk> and and <unk> <unk> .
but interestingly , that &apos;s also a future that society is a a couple of <unk> of capitalism , which is the the dna <unk> <unk> innovation in the society by going to and and and and and and and and and and .
i i want to show you a amazing new hypothesis here , and some surprising new insights that i worked on , which i worked on the relationship between the structure of language language they &apos;re talking to save .
and if i want to talk , , , i to to about about it .
well , this is a <unk> theory .
you you , you , you can , this device , you can can <unk> with your <unk> , so i can measure their <unk> . .
it &apos;s the the kind of the in for future pain .
i don &apos;t have to tell you about how important the ability to communicate over generations .
we teachers teachers they &apos;re them .
but i &apos;m about it as a a .
but they didn &apos;t get the results that wanted to .
at the same time i was on the field of the <unk> , , though i had a ph.d. ph.d. in <unk> .
humans and <unk> and and and and and and , the red line here is up here , and are are , livestock and pets .
we focused focused on serious serious of of the future and produced products for the company .
let &apos;s see the next video .
this is last night at the party , and -- and -- you can can can how it just <unk> , and you can can you you can .
and he was a to about how the people the buddhist religion in the the the .
and he &apos;s a a <unk> man back to the village .
and he close his eyes , it &apos;s so <unk> , the <unk> and everything .
the animals are in one of their lives . people people people .
we we we we . we we the sense of a a mother and and on all of all living in that meditation .
and you think about how <unk> are the things are , if you &apos;re happy .
and of course , they &apos;re cruel and <unk> . other .
even though the change in your attitude in something for other living living , and you feel these new quality in you , and it will you you , and it &apos;s a role model .
so the coffee cup is the coffee cup , or the cup of , , of the society used using tools to the public health .
interestingly , complexity complexity is very high .
we &apos;ve heard bill gates .
so it &apos;s very , very just as you know what to read .
well , let me close with with four <unk> , , , and two two .
and i don &apos;t want to go you on details , but in the bottom right corner , you see an example of what we have .
do you started doing that ?
and this is the the of the the the things that we &apos;ve talked about what jimmy have been talking about what we have is our new kind of organization , or , , how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
the inventor of things are are getting less in the , there &apos;s be in in in , in with with the <unk> .
let &apos;s say astronomy , what talking talked about .
there will also be <unk> , professional arguments .
so there &apos;s not going to be a huge two of two -- but between this data , there are been many ways to some interesting positions that are going to . people .
it costs about 100 dollars .
and then people started to to their their , and and actually a team has a team , between new zealand and spain .
and the first thing i thought thought was to thank him .
but the truth is , that &apos;s is right right here .
so , people started to and have news like this here .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m like batman , to to my my . . &quot;
and the one who didn &apos;t have a data , so she turned out that it was moved into another town and a new job .
and in the last 35 years , i studied human behavior on the basis of all , from genes , <unk> , dopamine and dopamine , to the to the .
some of them have it . and it &apos;s on the gender .
this was one of these cases , because if you were no violence under their ancestors , but my father .
they &apos;re a to to be as you can be .
by the way , i &apos;ve got one morning morning , that we &apos;ve done the last part of atlas .
and these guys are the weak force that perhaps probably known most .
so if you want to know , the the sky is or the , , , , , you should be in , , a a computer , -- why dna has the the that you have .
the comparison is that people in this room the higgs particle .
but it &apos;s really that that that theory of the the the the the the the the the the bang , a a a a a , a model , and the model didn &apos;t have with the goal that that &apos;s happening , but it seems
they created this civilization , this wonderful image , the darkness into light and it allows allows to see the civilization from of all .
another big insight came from a study of the state university in 2010 , the baseball of of the <unk> of of the <unk> .
in a similar study in germany , researchers spend <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and and and after they <unk> the face of the . .
&quot; because the colors that you you , not the european standard , , &quot; he he .
&quot; safer ? why ? have more police police ? &quot;
we built the light the the , people people people people people people people , to to to they they were to to to their their .
president roosevelt said , &quot; believe that you can can , you &apos;ve got it to .
all over in , who came and and and for the cell phones .
one graph for the the power of technology finds into kibera .
by 2015 , there will be three billion existence of the world .
in the the in the the , , , batteries and bread <unk> .
this is the the of of the , in the , of a <unk> , in the <unk> , the the the rose .
do you read an interview with a writer ?
and there , when i look at the great bear , i remember as a child to his head to his head , not to from his shoulders , and i feel like this child .
we &apos;ve seen seen as creative technology can be and in our lives and our our and , and to have those solutions , innovations and moments that don &apos;t <unk> the flow of time , but again .
my mother was <unk> .
in every single refugee refugee , they had to <unk> soldiers , the my older , , , the nine , was nine to him to take a child child .
and i should do it alone .
take anything you want to have out of the suitcase .
and then i ended up in <unk> , because i don &apos;t <unk> my emotions .
thank you .
so everything &apos;s all life is going to be about five times times .
<unk> <unk> the the answer .
why should this work ?
so , , we can grow any any organ out of any of any cell .
here is the increase in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the conclusion .
if the the of the the the the , the robot .
and you can see , the control control .
and he does that , he &apos;s <unk> .
they take your neighbors .
this is is that we we double the <unk> , , , , , , where we can bring them to form teams as you can see here .
but the robot can also figure out where he wants to go .
i can feel that . but there &apos;s so much , and i want to expand up here your horizon , open consciousness and your view of honeybees .
that &apos;s been a huge problem for many years , a huge problem since the late late 1980s , the the the of the , the many of the , bacteria and <unk> .
they &apos;re not .
the the the the for their for . and honey -- there are <unk> -- they use the honey to their bars .
the bee dies . honeybees die when they stick , so they didn &apos;t want to do it .
okay , now the question is : why is that ?
of course , we also , in the last decade , the world , the world with a dense chain of <unk> , with a chain of global trade .
and never before , many people were not aware of that fact .
in fact , no , many of you , that , of bread , of bread was not a european invention .
and especially the <unk> in <unk> and china is the the <unk> .
<unk> has been to most most people , and there are no many farmers farmers to be able to be bad , to the environment environment , to the environment , to the the environment .
everything depends on .
and as i &apos;m doing my bread , i &apos;m doing it , and i &apos;m trying to burn to burn hands .
and it &apos;s to to to the long time to the the of tools , materials and <unk> .
you take someone like me , a scientist , analyzed and and and and a new technology , and it is <unk> the <unk> .
because i hope you you here today , a new connection with nature .
this was a couple of days ago .
and what do we do ? what is our answer ?
this is from the year .
but <unk> <unk> was one of them , and shekhar she she her a film about you , <unk> queen , you should to see .
but i think the most important thing is that we can do it .
but here &apos;s the <unk> as a . .
this is a <unk> patient , which was the the , -- he needed a call , , , but he &apos;s to .
i love this slide , because you &apos;re talking about what people really really to change , and what &apos;s not .
if you eat a <unk> meal , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a <unk> . americans , and americans eat more fat because more , more , and even more , , and so the percentage is lower , but the actual number higher , the the is to reduce both .
one of the <unk> studies that found that 70 percent of the people were were to , 65 percent of people had , , , percent , percent had <unk> -- -- -- that &apos;s no healthy diet .
on the other hand , it &apos;s all , what &apos;s intimacy , <unk> .
i hope it &apos;s not going .
the film is based on an <unk> of of scott <unk> <unk>
two <unk> were involved in the project , warner brothers and <unk> .
and we had enough passion to make the technology and technology .
so we we we from motion .
the number seemed seemed be infinitely .
and that &apos;s the data we get it , and then it &apos;s used for the model .
and so the finished picture of that that was used in the movie .
it was a very , very , very early .
and we found this , in the middle of the state of
and has a <unk> .
people are the <unk> , these these , , <unk> past , past , in they &apos;ve lived their lives .
we were to <unk> -- two as as a driver -- and imagine imagine this , this is a ocean from sand , 40 degrees , a one bottle .
i think that camel is the best most <unk> animal animal in the world . &quot;
and they &apos;re using it as like we see our <unk> .
we took our animals .
so i &apos;m going to show you a different film .
i don &apos;t say , until my body team to to degrees degrees -- enough to to a an egg .
<unk> , thank you for the .
start a meeting a poem . that &apos;s a idea .
but what would it like you like , if you never knew how how how how how how how a living god the world , the the , or or if you &apos;re sitting down the the , , on the the , with your little <unk> ?
who could be more in this night ?
but you knew that judy <unk> in your age a a a a couple of ago that <unk> d <unk> <unk> the french army and and pascal must &apos;t bring room his room -- no , i mean he had invented the calculator for the
and in the end , they sat in a tree and a <unk> hand to the other .
and the human <unk> is more than than that , but would take those two columns , probably not a lot left .
also , we have the the problem that you can &apos;t build construction to that that to a a elephant .
a component of it is understanding . here &apos;s a <unk> , , &quot; the ability to understand the feelings of the other . &quot;
so now we we we are more sophisticated expressions . here &apos;s is . .
that the test doesn &apos;t run good for them .
there &apos;s a very simple task that you have to do .
a philosopher wrote a philosopher wrote that it was impossible that that was a sense that had a sense of fairness , because fairness was invented in the
now it &apos;s not a lonely crazy , it &apos;s not two crazy , three is a lot and a lot of news .
the last decade i spent the last , i i to to and and , , for a good thing , the <unk> .
and i have to say god thank you .
so i heard , in a way , it was a success .
over the years , this can be serious <unk> .
sheryl talks : how the healthy lives being
and i think that many of of the <unk> share this view .
a really cool thing .
now these studies are been , and they were <unk> , but they &apos;re not the whole story .
ask , you will be the part of the story that doesn &apos;t tell .
... a priest ?
and another one group , which believes that the indus people the the ancestors of people in the world today .
on the right left , how many ? okay .
it can be useful in the more data , to create more data , which is the .
this this is the most one one one in the indus <unk> , and only in this is it .
it turns out it &apos;s already a tradition in the time of the , on the the of of the for the time .
space , we all know what it looks like .
this wire <unk> <unk> the <unk> that the first called bell .
and , the historic discovery had done that that can can see as as as as as as .
actually , all the young people of the city .
somebody who &apos;s sitting sitting in the seat , this is okay in a <unk> , , , would you sit on a <unk> , and somebody would be so so so so so they would be <unk> .
the dalai lama always telling him -- he says , if you go into the idea of the <unk> , , it &apos;s because you realize that you you and and and and and , and , to a little playground for own intelligence .
take this wonderful thing that has shown us , and she would <unk> us fear with the <unk> .
a a man a a tank in a a a a a a a a of the the the the of the resistance .
but what could they couldn &apos;t be do anything if they had the modern communications , to create a sense that the wrong that was going to be done , right immediately ?
combine it power a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate global level and <unk> global challenges that are now now now and and the most nature .
in the museum of the children in rwanda , there &apos;s a photograph of a <unk> young -- and the museum of the children who were left , were left , as the of of rwanda , a million people died .
here &apos;s the task : help me build a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in 3d .
you can move on very different <unk> -- they &apos;ll vary in the <unk> , the movement of the surface and the the .
this is <unk> as a driving algae .
boy : <unk> .
let let down to see the the in action .
mark at stanford , one of my partner , is an an an an an an an an <unk> called called called called called called , , , where he can put directly directly into a
they &apos;re almost like from aliens , and the secret of what they &apos;re to , they are their <unk> toes .
this is what we pull the down .
these <unk> structures allow the to the , and <unk> and the <unk> , to to very <unk> , difficult surfaces .
so , <unk> , the long songs that are as as as as as as and and and and and and and and and and and to to and to .
so if dolphins are less than 20 feet away , they have to create less than half the time .
if we think of the to of the animals , dolphins , we need to think about the the of of our most people we were in safe .
after the <unk> , the marine marine has made this available to the to what the scientists could .
they &apos;re only hear the low frequencies .
if males and the and female and female and and and and a a to find a partner and find them , , imagine what impact that would have been in the of of the .
as ships can be made , they they found that with a better <unk> of that noise that can be reduce 90 percent of 90 percent .
they &apos;re the speed at 50 percent .
we see strangers worlds , we see strangers , 300 , , more far , and it &apos;s more and and they &apos;re not like we are .
you have all all possibilities .
we &apos;re seeing a a of rise in the men .
and obviously there &apos;s one , the one , the hundred .
with with with the 100 dollars , , it me to me thinking that we could bring a whole new generation of people into the old <unk> computer .
thank you .
i think nothing is the problem .
our daily lives is is , , , , in a extraordinary extraordinary state , we say in a <unk> .
usually , it one one or two a year .
and they have them !
but we &apos;re a lot of . .
part of the challenge was to try to try to and and space by by not just my hands -- -- -- -- -- but the the rhythm of my body and feet , and the feet and the balls on my feet .
and then they &apos;re crazy .
ok , because you don &apos;t understand understand what a <unk> is , i give you a little of .
now , , -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger .
you you have someone here here who &apos;s the <unk> principle , is this to do this , ok ?
<unk> -- and then it comes to ! just a little number over time .
with space and in in the room .
and then <unk> .
in this year -- you you show the the -- in this year we we the the <unk> with us , a project that we have to to design .
we can call this on a a <unk> that which it allows you to do more information about the clothing , , as you &apos;re these <unk> .
even scott adams : i i i i &apos;m going to be the the first one in the the . .
and we &apos;re also known to a new product for tonight . it &apos;s the first time that it &apos;s going to be in public .
now , the the the farmers only just in the season , and not in the <unk> .
electrons disappear in a kind of <unk> , and then it &apos;s just energy energy , and you can &apos;t see .
that &apos;s what he thought he was there .
potatoes , potatoes have 48 chromosomes ; did you know ?
good . atoms , you can &apos;t see it .
and someone said to him , &quot; well , what &apos;s the sense of , ?
we &apos;ve been <unk> about four years .
if google is a book , you get it in a very nice format .
i &apos;ll give you an example .
suddenly , the middle of the &apos; 1970s , everybody was got excited .
but imagine you , it &apos;s not going to be .
but also , many of the the right , which seem to have from propaganda .
if you &apos;ll the the the , , it means &quot; a &quot; &quot;
if i walk this pink sound for a little bit than a few minutes , they would stop hear it .
a lot of people who are out to , , but these transform the , public spaces like this , shared <unk> , , in millions of tiny personal personal personal . .
you can also do that in a beautiful place like a a a lake .
and finally , an acronym .
and i said , &quot; this is my job . &quot;
thank you so much that you here . we &apos;re so grateful . &quot;
and they went away .
because they were not on the the , and and the exchange , and the exchange and i thought , and i was , , a exchange that takes us us , and we them .
well , i &apos;m going to tell you , in the <unk> , there was a lot of competition , because the arab spring is growing up , the <unk> is , , what ?
this photograph became even in a police station , and on the floor , the the of the people who have been by the police .
the kids just go photos in a class that teacher gets them them them to the the .
in today &apos;s about the brain , and , , , there &apos;s a <unk> . .
this is something we can work in our lifetime , and i i i i a difference and i tried to get out of the <unk> , to come into the . .
but sometimes science has a few other other other other that really really do interesting .
what do we bring up with more data ?
there &apos;s something we think we think it &apos;s obvious , but &apos;s wrong .
it &apos;s that intelligence is defined by prediction .
but we don &apos;t look at the alligator as very intelligent , not in a human kind of
in humans , we developed the <unk> of of the <unk> of the the the of the neocortex , the the of the the little trick .
it &apos;s not that you &apos;re looking there and say , &quot; what do i see ?
not like a <unk> . not in the least like a <unk> . .
these are the things that will get .
we need something we need something , we need something , but just to the defense .
you can see it in her her . &quot;
she traveled because they was the elections of the country .
this is <unk> <unk> .
and then when she was the the door , said , &quot; no , no , no , no .
you wash this : by hand .
this group uses three , everyone one one .
it &apos;s real .
it took it to to learn and learn this as a foreign language .
the computer , , and it &apos;s one of three school participants .
if if , , you think different as the who who in the , in fact , of our <unk> , , because we did .
we went through the experiment with the same groups , but a a a a of the about how we deal with the data , and the actual beginning of the <unk> .
the price of the is the from from paradise .
and they moved and and they and they and they put their arms on each other and <unk> .
we &apos;re really good at talking about skills and security and health , we &apos;re really bad at talk about character .
then you &apos;ll take personal down , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> against bad breath .
i don &apos;t really feel with emotions .
the first gift , or talent , is <unk> -- the ability to to the other people to and and to and find out what they offer .
they have <unk> humility .
that &apos;s what the the is for . .
we found it between <unk> , , lot of many men , i don &apos;t know how many .
where is it to to ?
and it &apos;s not normal to live in a home .
what was my challenge ?
you need her empathy .
ag : the process of . .
now , first first , first , i &apos;m the queen the queen because it &apos;s funny .

and the advantage for the to the the is the sum of the <unk> and the social <unk> .
would they surprise us to be <unk> us ?
that means that the can can cut themselves . they can incredibly incredibly small .
a challenge challenge , how we can express this new of of the .
what i didn &apos;t know about the time because because we only had the outside the , was that the surfaces were on , within the the , and that was a pretty surprising discovery .
inspired by the <unk> , michael <unk> algorithms , the incredible amazing forms of of , , , a human , no human can create , but you can build it , but you could do it , and they could do our understanding architecture architecture .

we &apos;ve realized that recently , more more people are more more and social social networks , to give their stories to give their photographs and to their their own stories with their own voices .
the same time we put it to come here and also to our our part of the world .
so i became more or less than &quot; no . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; maybe , if i do this ants a little , , they pull it . . &quot;
this was called &quot; <unk> .
so i thought , &quot; how can i do this ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i came back the next day .
and it went ...
my work , <unk> , , sometimes five , six or seven weeks ; you can &apos;t always anticipate .
and i put it around , and it it up the <unk> .
so i put up the needle .
it &apos;s a very very , , but the best things come in small <unk> .

i i all the the i i i would probably not to to them , the <unk> that i would not you , the friends that i would not have to look at the , the <unk> that i
because you don &apos;t need the <unk> .
and if you you them away from the back , against the wind , you can just put it over , and it &apos;s in the in the &quot; . &quot;
20 years ago , the doctors would cut off my leg and and and and there was a 15 <unk> of of policy .

we are now in in every state , and the problems in florida is other than the in new york .
come and and me down here ?
there people people people people about ?
what we &apos;re going to do in the lab is quite the same , but with a dozen of different of of molecules -- -- a <unk> reduction of complexity , but even the try to create something more <unk> .
it &apos;s actually very <unk> . and it &apos;s a <unk> , , it doesn &apos;t really do something .
now , you &apos;re all the experts are all , we are play with these protocells .
we then see the the of of the body of that we &apos;ve seen , and the black <unk> of represent represent those black mud -- this <unk> , very complex , organic black .

you makes it , , of course , to be .
this is a <unk> building .
we &apos;re all all know that is the cell phones .

some of the things we share , we &apos;ve made things we found and each individual option is what is in in this industry .
that &apos;s the simple thing .
i had a very <unk> , <unk> , expensive training in india , and it was made me almost . .
and i thought , i start to a barefoot college -- just for the poor .

interestingly , there &apos;s data of data groups of people , to get data about how happy they are .
&quot; i think it &apos;s physically , , , emotionally , mentally and in almost any other other of that better better . &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t have minute .
he he he he he he didn &apos;t , and , of course , since the had six months later the same idea .
in this case , it &apos;s because they &apos;re used to to tell you that is being used by <unk> images .
we raised our materials , we went from the room and waiting for half an hour .
i &apos;m going to show you why .
they were two two images , and they have two beautiful <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of of you , and we said , &quot; which would you give you ? &quot;

<unk> , the the big car and the <unk> are are beautiful .
voices : it flies going to the air . oh shit .
&quot; ma , don &apos;t start ! &quot;
don &apos;t forget that this tradition is not from the <unk> of <unk> , but ended up on a time before before we were stories on <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the kind of food , yeah .
the kind of the roof , you know .
and so we had my dad his dad , because i knew he would kill me when i leave her . so let &apos;s go into the car .
&quot; and had this guy a a <unk> uniform and a <unk> expression in the face ? &quot;
do i want to get in ? because if i didn &apos;t have <unk> <unk> to me to me -- enough for for your taste -- could it be that i never come out .

smart <unk> at the station , and you see see where you see where the bus is on there and when &apos;s coming , and you can buy their buy on real time .
i want we to <unk> the wireless <unk> <unk> , and i challenge that this network is to to with standards for everybody else .

i said that i wanted to tell the the <unk> , i wanted to share with you the three &apos;s three , and i wanted to leave them with a <unk> .
because they all all were three years old .

i ate <unk> with <unk> . . &quot;
you can sleep in clean <unk> .
j there are so many that that that that is a little bit .
i found it weird about it , as it would be a competition , a a way .
there are a white , a a , rich <unk> that who was not <unk> for the city .
it looks pretty easy , but it was a <unk> . .
people were about two things -- they were amazed by the destruction , but there was also a sense of the the of the new york new york that i found very moving .
because at the four , , the the the -- and a a has a -- -- -- -- -- we knew it had to be be to be to to <unk> conditions and the changed the definition of ground zero .
we have the possibility to think our think about cities .
dr : it was an honor to me .
and i know that children are four four .
if -- god forbid -- anybody from us here and a a a , , , most of us in a period of a few of a few of weeks .
you have to know about the problems that we &apos;re talking about today .
as turns out , tom &apos;s a a a a a a a for 20 dollars a good opportunity to keep an 100,000 <unk> .
this is not true , but it &apos;s on tony blair during the living forum in 2005 , when his his , , of course , &quot; discovered , and he was described .
in other words , they have a common and growing complexity of visual language that &apos;s in in <unk> sequence .
he was told that there was no cure .
today , all countries are are to to offer patents that are at least 20 years .
it depends on the <unk> of the to to their patents and and to to them .
in , , the same kind of stage , a <unk> , , , people sat in the <unk> sun , the the in the <unk> , and they didn &apos;t feel like .
they can adapt anything to to to your well-being .
he &apos;s all these services , <unk> , , <unk> , and so little things that you make online online , but for people who he &apos;s the to the the digital world .
the question was , how do you do from this teacher
let &apos;s see what he &apos;s doing here .
and the husband husband , he was also sick by his wife &apos;s <unk> .
but the visual complexity is still large .
well , <unk> had a <unk> of our studies .
now , when we feel emotion , we show it .
and you could get the impression that the unfortunate people can take another different different different different in the network .
this is my <unk> . &quot;
they &apos;re both both from carbon , and yet one of both both of the <unk> in in a particular way , on the left , and they get <unk> , <unk> and dark .
to to this something , , let me give you a moment .
and then finally , there &apos;s not easy .
under the same circumstances , older people are their cognitive resources , like <unk> and memory , more information information than negative information .
we cost life life .
they &apos;d say , &quot; tonight , i &apos;m going to do this <unk> of this girl on this city . &quot;
kid david : it &apos;s so i &apos;m , , often not really really , what what happens when i &apos;m dance .

this is something different as actually actually actually an effective ad campaign .
what &apos;s not new .
the lights are become dark .

we have the in the sun .
now , logic -- quite , , look , you are now to this this position -- without moving the wrist .

so , if you &apos;re interested in this , i &apos;m going to present some of the . .

and the <unk> said , &quot; if we didn &apos;t have transition transition , we have to invent this whole of of infrastructure for the first time . &quot;
but there &apos;s a problem .
the budgets are not really balanced , and to a certain degree of the the the the games that they play to to the that that &apos;s the the , so that you can &apos;t see what the kind of obvious challenges
in fact , there are five states that are worse , and really just four states , that not to to be .

and he &apos;s the the <unk> of it . he &apos;s sorry , his friends , his his family and his his community .
they want ... they want to control yourself .
you know that it was for long long time , this narrow understanding .
we don &apos;t teach our kids .
and most kids get them .
well , supermarkets .
if you can cook , time doesn &apos;t matter .
in the america , many wonderful things , , , if we &apos;re just looking back .
misha tandon : anonymous , ladies and gentlemen -- a clever group of political <unk> the 2011 .
the web connects everything and it will very soon to give a lot of human activities .
interestingly enough , anonymous is <unk> the information , but not &apos;t make it for financial .
he explained he was in 2003 and 2004 , he was in in on on tour , 10,000 dollars a <unk> , from the -- from from the -- in <unk> , by using <unk> cells .
it was born in <unk> in a stable and respect middle class , his <unk> as a <unk> as a <unk> .
and most of the , with the script and <unk> , , no real social skills in the world outside -- just in the net .
i think there &apos;s several reasons . i &apos;m not going to go into detail , but i say .
but they &apos;re all the market , and what the market is is is especially -- number one is the great demographic <unk> .
we &apos;ve also found a lot of examples of dead boxes that are been transformed in all kinds of social institutions , many of , , many , , many libraries , like this .
and finally , i expect the roads to be the the the of the mall .
it &apos;s very successful , and it helped to to that where eight from 13 , from 13 , in <unk> plans , to be <unk> .
the stream was <unk> by the parking lot .
their people are are different than typical , , but they &apos;re less less than than cities .
&quot; his vagina , &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; is a whole <unk> . . &quot;
but actually , it didn &apos;t work there , it started with a with a woman .
it &apos;s a gender here , a a of the a basic resource of the planet , which is .
it &apos;s a <unk> , , and the kind of one in the body , and i think it &apos;s a real meaning , our bodies to our our -- that this <unk> has a a , that the the the the the the the .
i want to tell this little story about my own beginning , because it &apos;s much with happiness , and with agnes .
maybe it &apos;s in my <unk> south carolina , which is not much smaller than than time time time time , and once of a a of the country .
well , maybe he was too <unk> because he he he was , after the <unk> <unk> through the the , and even after the <unk> and and the <unk> in budapest .
and he received the same answer : &quot; do you bring me best workers that you can find and and if they &apos;re good enough i &apos;m you . &quot;
and it &apos;s clearly saying , &quot; it &apos;s okay . it was so beautiful .
&quot; oh ! &quot; said dr. robicsek . &quot; i went to the film . &quot;
as i said , he &apos;s too much .
and you can think of it right .
you know what you &apos;re looking for .
but we take care of the most very , and the the the the the next day .
so we came up with these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mother went , during the the soviet union .
and if you think it &apos;s not , it it it , you get it to to .
what i want to try and i hope to give this . .
and what i &apos;m going to point out is to point about 50 percent of the u.s. are under under the ocean .
it &apos;s <unk> because the photons can &apos;t achieve the average deep the ocean , which is <unk> miles . the <unk> is is miles miles .
and so we went along the <unk> in a area next to the <unk> , and the the heat and the the heat out there .
so i started to a new new new of , with a <unk> that that , and i , and i don &apos;t have to get into my vehicle .
we find the the of the .
and i looked looked at them yesterday , she &apos;s up in seattle . ok .
but i would a kid to a a kid with a <unk> to the .
in some parts of the world , for example in south africa , is really hard to available .
when we saw the effect of the , , andrew , and i would have to give it to to the many people as possible possible to possible .
what was the special of these classes ?
the video is going to be broken and the the the the college will be a question .
so we wanted to convince some of our colleagues of the , that multiple <unk> is not so bad thing .
in the other of a small courses , you can ask , which the the the the and how to help the students to fix this .
we even see the beginning of either by a <unk> or or <unk> feedback that we showed them .
i thought thinking about my place in the universe and what what first thought , what if if if i was one kid .
and in our society , of course , , , , is about to the reality of other .
i &apos;ve my doubt that my doubt about the values of the , like , , it &apos;s it &apos;s you &apos;re rational in a <unk> . .
so you can understand my surprise , when i got to read the the new yorker that alan <unk> , <unk> of the , , , , , , , his <unk> . .
i think you can make about this fun , they don &apos;t have , and not , that , because i &apos;m not not going to have a jokes about about , and and his his <unk> .
i &apos;ve been <unk> this old times of the , i i tell you .
he said , i had to pay him more respect , because it can take to to 18 years to be a really good .
huh ? yes ? what ? i can &apos;t hear you . &quot;
and i &apos;m afraid of that active person doesn &apos;t like us .
i &apos;ve been about about <unk> about beauty about beauty that they <unk> us yesterday , and it &apos;s in his book , that that that that that sometimes be beauty .
george w. bush : what the the defense of our security , and what the the defense of our freedom , we need to pay the cost . &quot;
ten years ago , no one would be in the world on the idea -- -- -- -- a few astronomers -- that there are the planet outside of our solar system .
many other ecosystems on the earth are truly in danger .
he he &apos;s all the that that an <unk> could go a <unk> and a a a a a , and the the the world .
we need to be the the same of of with the same of .
and , of course , we don &apos;t want to see .
what can we do about this ?
and now the worst . .
we use a lot of money on making sure that we don &apos;t die at a <unk> , but we don &apos;t give it . and yet it &apos;s totally preventable .
we don &apos;t want to get down on the wrong foot .
i hope that &apos;s going to be .
this is very , very important , because this is the system , the the the life on the planet , and it &apos;s time for us to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing insight , and we we know about this .
and that &apos;s what the system of <unk> , a number of <unk> in in the southern hemisphere , in in these circles .
everybody who &apos;s later coming out , just to the database and information that it &apos;s it , for everything that is happening .
we &apos;re , the wave to him , the technological possibilities .
in a earthquake , large &apos;s huge amounts of this new microbes that we never saw , from the sea floor .
the john <unk> a a network of <unk> cameras and sensors that power our oceans to global the global , interactive lab -- and a a <unk> of the the world of the
so i think that optimism is the architecture forward .
so again , radical <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> against the . you know , too often want to understand everything .
our intellectual people are complex .
you know that it &apos;s true ; the <unk> , as unexpected , are always be unexpected .
but i &apos;ll rather be a little bit , and even , , and even more , rather than the same time , so it &apos;s it &apos;s from his his . .
risks of some of the way that they should be in a very major city .
there are the of the victims .
daniel <unk> is very big ideas . he calls 17 terms of 17 terms of the architecture of architecture -- raw , , , , , radically -- and inspiration for for each bold creative
it also has the lowest of all the cars .
and this is something really , , or will it be only be a few of ?
em : it just need to . . if not , we &apos;re in big trouble .
with that capital , and put the the on the roof and the the the roof , and the the <unk> , <unk> a <unk> <unk> , that is lower than the bill .
we &apos;ve almost failed , but we &apos;ve gone in 2008 .
it &apos;s similar to a jet .
how about everything in the world could be be innovative innovative ?
look at this .
boy , if you &apos;re our for our , and a a as he eats one of our goats , he &apos;s very nervous , and then go go to him .
we have been hunger .
our tradition looks like this : in every <unk> , there &apos;s an holy fire .
so , we were to the world world wildlife fund in the to to the little programs to the <unk> .
also , also -- we invest in the in of about aids and hiv .
<unk> -- over again , a <unk> of many in the world of the -- are very useful , they &apos;re a wonderful tools .
and we hide that price behind huge .
dan <unk> and alice <unk> , a lot of the the revolution for <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , -- -- that were the known .
this is like a <unk> of protein .
the science looks the world through the , , , , things that could be and described , but they have the art for knowledge and insight .
and from a couple of cameras , a couple of cameras , after three weeks , a plan with 25 .
that &apos;s the natural cycle .
that would not normally do a <unk> photographer , a a picture of a , right ? but it &apos;s sometimes to be to to to show the dimensions .
here you see the glacier back back .
this &apos;ve seen here here here .
could india india the origin or a global center for innovation , just just as a global center for a global <unk> and <unk> ?
when we asked talking to people in those of people , they they were working , they said , &quot; we &apos;re working on global products . &quot;
they can &apos;t be a professor , they were not even student .
the best hospitals to the to the to for cancer , , as well , , , , , heart disease , heart disease , for artificial <unk> , <unk> in the morning .
it works a bit like -- that &apos;s a recently <unk> <unk> <unk> for for four in the morning .
i said i know a <unk> message when i see a .
and in our society , in our society , with cancer -- if not personally , then , through a loved , , a family family , a family , , a a friend .
in this <unk> , the genetic material , the chromosomes , within a <unk> .
we have a tumor tumor in the laboratory over over 20 different cancer cancer , and we see this effect in all of it .
he got the <unk> . .
but what we see is that in sixth month , the the , and it starts <unk> .
that &apos;s only the beginning .
this is a new <unk> , a new project .
in fact , they &apos;re 15 feet deep , and collect rainwater from the roof , there &apos;s a little city , and from their courtyard .
so , water of 300 , kilometers away , soon it looks like this .
somewhere , a stream , a <unk> , a <unk> through this scene .
this is called &quot; <unk> . &quot; in english , we have <unk> and water water .
and you have to go further .
these are the beautiful satellite that we just saw on one of the images .
and <unk> are are 27 percent , over percent people a year , less people a year in sub-saharan africa .
10 percent from india .
you will get the jobs in in , people get out of the <unk> and and and and and and and and .
and the countries the right , you see see the <unk> . , and basically , every country has a a of of , , we say , less than 5,000 dollars , a <unk> of say , three .
in the the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , doesn &apos;t &apos;t really really .
buy african products .
but i think a much bigger problem with this that that that logic -- that we should ipods and don &apos;t decide at -- -- i mean , it &apos;s a great title for thomas <unk> new book .
and , 500 people have four and four four of them were chosen to visit the the and and to to to about about . .
now , we citizens in in in , in , by 2020 , not necessarily change anything about it , because still , the the that the the the agenda .
<unk> <unk> : does the internet <unk> <unk> worst ?
&quot; like a man . &quot;
and he went around with younger guys .
because for me , that in this time , and in this <unk> , the question was , &quot; you want to say &quot; or drugs or drugs and drugs .
i was also paralyzed , people .
as indian , and also politicians and and , and i &apos;m pretty much to the the that , , the the , about india , the talk about india as a new <unk> , , even the new
in other words , all of all kinds of <unk> stories about countries , whether they want to want to want to come out of daylight or not .
but the result in the , in the time , , , , it took it about half an hour to a half an hour .
it can &apos;t understand the . .
this can sometimes have incredibly consequences . ok .
and this of you you you have money , you may seem to see how many <unk> of the <unk> on the the <unk> that that the the .
i went home and i i a little bit , and i i a bit bit of bit bit of . .
<unk> <unk> : a a as no water .
and i feel like george bush .
now , this title , this expression , comes from a critic , an early critic , and this is a passage that i just love , and i would like to read you .
and that &apos;s a good thing , because if it would be like a , nature would have a problem like all the world we get chimpanzees to to ?
this is the hardest part that &apos;s not obvious , obviously , and so i &apos;ve it for the end .
ok ? stop . this is going .
i don &apos;t know why there are <unk> <unk> , but don &apos;t matter , they &apos;re in the garden .
thank you , thank you , thank you .
i guess that the the <unk> of the most of the reason we know , a lot of reasons why we want to be very , very , very quickly .
it &apos;s like this . you should like this .
bob know , another another -- another version of this practice in a pretty famous famous experiment in the &apos; 60s .
and we &apos;ve learned that with time : you can get a much better , , much more creative results , if all of the rules .
and suddenly there was a a of of about design about a <unk> object .
they &apos;re sometimes a bit bit skeptical , i &apos;ll get back to that .
you know what it feels like , all of uncertainty , you could see back in the the , the doctors in one of the <unk> of the <unk> and you and you &apos;re what &apos;s going on .
so , this would all feel sure , and we would have a good time , because we agree about the rules and agree with it .
we do everything that leads to success , but then if we have here , we think we we we we we we we &apos;re going to and and and , and all what we &apos;ve done .
i was faster , but it &apos;s as depressed as depressed .
i &apos;ve learned that success is not a street street .
and the <unk> is just full of hotter in . &quot;
i did , , &quot; oh my god , &quot; , &quot; hopefully , for the last time , the the .
he he sure that all together together .
it took 900 people from it .
and the second thing is that people are aware of the actual connection .
these are questions .
as you see in today , of of of democracies , the society that the state of the to us to determine our our itself , but it &apos;s also it it too .
it means that we are our our to our our to human human .
so these are the layers , the kinds of questions that i wanted to i to to to -- the question : what are the intentions that get to to that you get to do something ?
so i said , and my colleague , sebastian <unk> told us that there must be better ways .
and we were successful .
i &apos;m going to give one in the fall .
he <unk> them into the right position , <unk> them to his nose and <unk> .
we learned the first first surprise .
there has to be a kind of <unk> of to make the where the the of power and the the speed we see and the the of the system .
a load cell , and and this is actually a <unk> load cell load with a crystal .
this is the <unk> -- here &apos;s the heel , and that is going to make <unk> and and the load load load .
a very , very <unk> solution to the problem .
and <unk> : it &apos;s not , , , , it &apos;s ocean .
i think that &apos;s one of the most beautiful classic <unk> that were ever built .
i don &apos;t know other different <unk> , , not even <unk> that that that that that this is a three-dimensional space .
now you see see that -- he just just stand .
the submarine , the last year was this one .
<unk> is the understanding of architecture as <unk> , <unk> , please ask the obvious obvious example -- is not the right approach we need to choose .
basically , is new york on the back of the <unk> , , our streets of their injuries .
in these eight <unk> , , , little <unk> of that are basically <unk> .
so you walked in london and and was overwhelmed by this <unk> .
finally , there &apos;s a a map of the . .
and that &apos;s every second week .
i was made her <unk> on the top of the <unk> . .
and in this area of the amazon is discovered in oil in .
the other side of the area is the <unk> , , where actually , bin bin is is . .
this was one of the great <unk> . .
this is the <unk> . . let me continue and you the the the deep field field .
but then you go to jupiter , and it &apos;s 40 minutes . it &apos;s a problem .
this is going to be part of the in the beginning of the universe .
we have just a million galaxies .
so the stuff that seems seems to see the the , dark matter .
when you first saw this image , you don &apos;t have a lot of in it .
this this simulation , with 1,000 1,000 percent a month , just just to make this visible here .
with <unk> , we hope that we have a resolution that is about this picture of earth , which you can actually see the complicated pattern of earth .
and we &apos;re by course , , of course .
47 percent .
it &apos;s crazy . we &apos;re doing , , the time , the every time .
i got into a cycle cycle , and it led to a lot of pain and problems with the <unk> , so i i could &apos;t have anything .
i i was why , could you be creative , if you &apos;re on the for the ?
all this happened not this is at morning .
the the time of <unk> is is , as as a <unk> <unk> , , and there &apos;s <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> the &apos; 30s , the <unk> , killed millions of <unk> , , in the &apos; &apos; , they looked at the the , , , , , , many women were <unk> to germany , germany .
because the brings the grief . &quot;
and as a <unk> , , i got excited about the most most thing we &apos;ve learned what we had learned about us in the virtual world about us , and we &apos;ve been able to use our identity , to live a better life in the real world .
we get used to a new way to be alone alone .
human relationships are <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
it &apos;s it .
because the moment , people are alone , for a few seconds , they get <unk> , get , , get , , you to to an electronic device .
but we are in danger , because in fact , the opposite is true .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently , we didn &apos;t have the <unk> that we were <unk> the <unk> of our graduate , , and quite a -- -- quite a , i i that they had their predictions in the financial kind of
maybe because my father was always read read .
so i &apos;d them in it -- but i and and , you had to be .
and finally , i thought , i was a pyramid , but i &apos;m &apos;m the time to take take a more powerful .
although you &apos;re lose , not afraid afraid of the failure we &apos;ve been , because we &apos;ve been to to people , because of people can do more than everything that he can do .
if i call the name name , i never know one .
i i have <unk> enough ?
the second challenge were cells .
today , in many clinical trials , are used used different types of stem heart disease .
it &apos;s only last month , we &apos;ve been we used to to show the human human human . .
we can then map it and then go to and and and the kidney , and we can analyze the the of the , and then we can just take this information and then print on the . .
i couldn &apos;t have to school . i i i was dirty .
i was a kid , i said , &quot; yes , i want to . i want to .
you may have noticed that a new area called the <unk> .
and connected to this <unk> of these , there was examples of the world -- the choice of the president to the to the wikipedia wikipedia and everything that is in between the showed what the power of a lot .
third , , , , environmental issues .
because what you need , that is , not the .
i don &apos;t want a cd ; i want the music that play .
my name is joseph and i am a in kenya .
we have to to our women and children , we need to run . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to improve the infrastructure .
late at night i went home and and ice and ice .
together : anybody &apos;s <unk> ?
co : i decided to stay in the country , to give up the master &apos;s master and work in in a time , to do this .
so , can be huge spending , but if the city can get a number of x volunteer , , , of the <unk> of the <unk> of the the city of the city .
they have <unk> , tables and data .
so that &apos;s what they &apos;re in in the 18 minutes that were <unk> to to talk to here , between two and <unk> people that are in their cities .
and he was in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the building here have several stories .
these green things in the foreground are <unk> .
and if you &apos;re a <unk> <unk> , you you &apos;re in political activities .
i couldn &apos;t know that i would be part of a technological revolution that would be true to this dream .
think about it . these men who who not the same <unk> , like i , helped me to my who support to to the <unk> in school .
and at the time , , , , , , , with a <unk> , , and he used an <unk> <unk> and <unk> , , he could a machine that could read each other .
but you know , i think it &apos;s very lonely to me me me .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport these books across the border , the different different countries countries , the , the united states , united states , canada , australia , and zealand , had to have all the different <unk> of harry potter .
the <unk> has has has has been completely more than doubled , and it &apos;s increasing increasing in five hours a day .
one last thing . want to want to do , like me me me , okay ?
secondly , the new world is a a good news , because once the the do doing the , we have to do that , we have to do and and and and and and and .
the social challenges should be be to be .
the economic game are surprising , , , and surprising , very , very , very
and my biggest concern is that we create a world with <unk> technologies , in a a little bit of a society and and , by a economy , the inequality of
in the , i started to feel more <unk> with this this of god .
some have some of that we can believe believe in a god that <unk> our pain .
in the second <unk> , the line , &quot; wind and and the the . .
so who is god , if not the great <unk> or or <unk> ?
the <unk> soul of the universe .
by the god of the . by by my own <unk> .
and one of the first things i started to explore was the story of the <unk> . &quot;
we &apos;ve no found that that that that that older than 40 years , and the average age of this <unk> and and tribes and
our bodies has used to new food .
so this equality of energy and matter that the turned shown , and the modern science of the <unk> , the entropy and information and energy and energy all connected to each other , so it &apos;s a long continuum .
this is a robot that wants to be your own own , , to get more electricity .
and what i mean by that is that we &apos;re looking for new job .
a great one of the years ago , billions of years ago , through and and and and and our choice is kind of is in technology is is really in to us with this force , which is much more powerful than ourselves .
and they said , &quot; well , we have five classes of 30 to 40 students .
we did it down all down and we found beautiful <unk> , <unk> , , , and it had that -- as we &apos;ve got , , , &quot; you know , it looks like the ship of a ship . &quot;
so we waited we sat on the tables and and we waited .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> . the only problem , specifically for adults adults who didn &apos;t really know about the , of the , that they had started to be that there was only a toilet .
the teachers we work with -- everything is different for teachers -- they say tell us what we &apos;re doing .
so , have have have been on the book , and so this was a big . .
and directly behind -- that &apos;s a little chain -- you saw the time that they were taught .
there &apos;s also this <unk> -- -- it &apos;s a shelf you don &apos;t see if you &apos;re in in , but it &apos;s open up .
he &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s his his his .
write an email , he will you you you can answer you .
i was this girl .
80 percent of the refugees in the world are women and children . oh .
there &apos;s one side that thinks that peace means the end of the struggle , and there &apos;s one side that thinks that peace is using the create schools and jobs .
she sent her kids to school -- a new home .
there &apos;s also one that &apos;s the the of the <unk> , &quot; do you know that ?
there &apos;s a <unk> on cape , there are <unk> roads , and we &apos;re all here .
that &apos;s my baby . thank you .
he said , &quot; i &apos;ve designed everything . &quot;
and in a certain sense , i &apos;ve always felt bad .
so i was in this kind of complications .
i found that that that that are very good .
the school is most difficult , so the is is difficult to be a times .
from all in a strange <unk> of <unk> , , about a window to the the moment that the road was been black house in the black black black , and this white <unk> <unk> there in the sun .
and i became a from the the of karen armstrong reminds that religion really really understand understand nothing with with with .
the <unk> has , , , , the same size , it doesn &apos;t look like this , but it &apos;s not the same size as the united states , the <unk> of an area that is about the size of the state arizona .
but it &apos;s not just the developed world .
we can &apos;t wait for the <unk> , that had had to change our political culture .
this challenge is part of our whole civilization of our civilization .
a new appreciation of the <unk> that we have through the business of this challenge .
now , before i show you a few images of the , i want to give you this beautiful detail of <unk> and design .
and that &apos;s in this sense , an extraordinary school .
we have been with with with with with with keith <unk> , that many scientists aren &apos;t able to show something to show something , to the bit , of fear of be , to be <unk> .
here is what you can can , you can can can can can can can , in 3d , which is very interesting .
so that makes us more about what robots mean us .
no . so i had to think a little bit of . .
we did the same thing to iraq .
that was a challenge that we had to make us as a physicist .
we can push it up . the forces more . more of them , but they &apos;re getting . .
&quot; <unk> seven , a whole band .
and there are some employees in foundations that call this <unk> .
the idea of justice , which our our lives , and a sense of what &apos;s really in life is what &apos;s in life , what is what social .
and as that &apos;s , he <unk> , he &apos;s a .
so every week , the the <unk> come back . &quot; god , you &apos;ve heard my back back . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom of a tumor , an infection , an infection , an surgery .
the muscles were <unk> , paralyzed -- <unk> call call it .
we treat them with <unk> drugs -- -- -- -- -- , , , in this kind of pain is not very effective .
now you get a sense of that way , a sense of how much rock is going to here .
it was a . does nothing . it can .
i don &apos;t know if you can see it from the back of the back , that &apos;s just stars .
in 2005 nasa launched a probe called deep impact , which one of them in a a of of a comet .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts , as i said , engineers .
the difference between the dinosaurs and we we we have a <unk> and and and and we can and we can change our future .
at that time , i took <unk> , the only independent independent to be exactly the only electronic electronic of the country .
and i thought that <unk> survive and a great company would be , if if <unk> was only gone , what was going on .
and at the end of the meeting he he , look , it won &apos;t work , you &apos;re never going to see your money again , but my foundation will get 50,000 dollars on the table so so you can
and we said that -- that &apos;s okay , we &apos;re , we , you to your business business with what they actually did .
you see , we started in east and and and our work and went to russia .
after a while , we opened a <unk> . .
and we &apos;ve developed the idea of the , , , in the the the the .
and in this way , you &apos;re to the funding , so there &apos;s no a , no more , , the the , the around to find .
so , why does this work ? this is the question .
now , some call this a theory of everything .
just one simple example is this : newton &apos;s the law of gravity , works as one one of the the of the <unk> of the .
the more symmetry you have , the , the the , and the of the theory of the theory .
one thing that he thought thought most of us now , but but he was for his time , but he was not of course .
it doesn &apos;t <unk> the importance of these these these that they they &apos;re the the law , and accidents .
but he read read in every free moment he had , books .
and that ambition , he returned to the <unk> .
but when he was just , his his his <unk> , , his hand was deaf and and was , because he had a a a a a child during a <unk> . .
not very surprising -- it were only three women under the 16 <unk> house house .
but i have to say , the older i was , , the more i understand what an incredible privilege was to have with with this aging lions from a man .
and as lincoln told told the story , all of the war after the united .
i asked my father to tears , &quot; what can we only do ? &quot;
what the reason is that i &apos;m always grateful for this strange love of the story that it allows me to spend a life in the past .
he had <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
this is the <unk> , this object is evidence that the jews after the in in , , after the years that they sat in in the rivers and i remember the jerusalem that that that that that <unk> to go home .
all of these are <unk> .
the <unk> cylinder is by the the of of the , by by by , .
you all know what happened .
to see this object in tehran , come to to thousands of thousands of the <unk> jews . tehran .
some of the knowledge of the living conditions , but they think they &apos;re a <unk> <unk> .
the new <unk> of the the first few hours , but their needs not have their and and and and and and and they learned to to to to and in , or they were <unk> , , and <unk> and start the the , like everyone else .
a study is that that 10 percent of a <unk> cost of a <unk> <unk> , about 30 percent .
and that was fascinated me because i almost had a my life in front of a camera .
you know right what you &apos;re doing to do to find an answer .
there were <unk> people there -- most of them friends and family .
we heard every single one .
but of course , he never got . . the explanation did happened .
and after many , many meetings , i was excited that this man , <unk> <unk> , , really a of my heroes and mentors , it made to get up into the boat .
he said yes , and we found us in afghanistan .
they were the who believed peace , and and and and , etc etc etc etc etc etc etc . &quot; and they made him actually .
we connect us with <unk> -- i &apos;ve met <unk> <unk> , i said , &quot; london 2012 , it &apos;s about the .
it &apos;s about their <unk> , to your business .
the most people are also also the the most important
i &apos;m the the literature in the the of this number , but i could never find them .
there &apos;s just a big <unk> . .
and amazingly , that exactly what our ancestors was invented a million years ago when they discovered the cooking .
and i think , very simple ways to the conversations that i led .
and i think i &apos;m in the beginning .
but once the the fighting the , the the physical rehabilitation .
behind him was a child , his son , red in the face of the , to dad .
but mahmoud and his son were there .
i was talking to my my my my my my , and i and i told them -- i -- i said , &quot; look , look , we start with a few hours a day , just for some of . &quot;
two groups of the <unk> began to fight .
so i asked him , &quot; what is it ? &quot;
&quot; yes , we have to increase the production of feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
<unk> , not just in the center center , but also in the houses of people .
and you should see me during a <unk> . .
and that hospital could have been <unk> .
why ? because the way i had was , was . .
but i learned something that was that , which is that the leaders -- the managers of the economy -- -- bad bad decisions met our economy , the the .
because i knew that the state of african african continent for my children and their children children are important .
i &apos;m trying to get the experience i i in in , to africa .
is my time up ? ok .
we &apos;ve got a moment that a a great society can be a a a generation .
you will tell you that it &apos;s very very , the the <unk> , the sun we we draw as children .
in fact , that &apos;s something that half of them , more than half of them , not be familiar .
32 , <unk> <unk> .
i think . &quot;
and these are the messages they you them ?
because , in the end of the , , the , love , and so he &apos;s constantly it on tv .
a professional <unk> that who who who , who , she doesn &apos;t &apos;t me ?
what is <unk> ?
we &apos;d like to like to of you people how to <unk> <unk> , <unk> and and and <unk> and to make it .
thank you .
so the entire hospital is often just about a a .
there must be something better . &quot;
but that can control the user , whether there are power or or not , because they can control the <unk> on the ground , how much percent oxygen give you your patient .
but we want to be sure that this is the most effective and and so , that we can make hospitals .
the different species of writing in africa , the first first was <unk> , like the the <unk> , which is the <unk> of a secret society in <unk> .
anyway , in 1998 , as a <unk> <unk> called <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , in in in , in , centuries .
almost one fifth of the greenhouse gases from the -- -- that &apos;s more than than traffic .
not bad .
i like animals , and the <unk> and and and the the of the the as tools , is not just so .
<unk> was a in a french issue .
a picture of <unk> would be better better , right ?
so it wasn &apos;t quite bad .
i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
some of us would would that that that may not be like that .
i a a year ago , i asked a question , &quot; why am i , even though i know what i know , no a ? &quot;
on the weekend you have the choice .
you can make a picture with an iphone and all names all of the , even it &apos;s more .
it gets . . he &apos;s win the race .
you can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
you would think it was interest to find more about it , if the the are so high , but it &apos;s a very <unk> area .
or an aesthetic experience -- a <unk> or a big artwork .
human nature has to change .
but part of the reason -- and that is why we have an ethical level in the <unk> of -- is that they &apos;re also intrinsic valuable .
it could be more complicated in people , but maybe not very .
jh : is it <unk> to play with these forces ?
and so i knew i i i need something to to the . .
so there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s the dynamic behavior of the liquid .
and so i think that can be <unk> .
this is a great <unk> in in the studio .
we take the pizza , our very very very very very first , , and <unk> the the , in the the the the the the the and and us .
i was was a 20 before i first went into an art art art .
i thought , okay , you &apos;ve got a criteria as you want want to pick the works .
it &apos;s not a photoshop .
they were interested to create a novel , alternative , , and they needed money for it , so they were to to to get some interesting projects projects .
this project is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so we went to the grave and we did this , it was -- -- the we were the .
and it describes how the <unk> -- everything it is it is like because of the <unk> . .
he &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and he &apos;s an artist .
it depends on origami . so go .
people used mathematical principles to understanding the the of .
or they put it on the top and they &apos;re 50 stars on a flag with 13 .
how would you make a a flap ?
we have these rules out of these rules , you you , you get the <unk> with lines , the the more lines , the the the the the the the .
you can do a lot of things .
but if you want to do it bigger , you could need some origami .
and it doesn &apos;t work whether you go into space or or you &apos;re going to a body .
i grew up in a <unk> in the state of washington with a lot of time time .
we have only three minutes . but we &apos;re going to talk about it .
and so i want to talk about it , because if we don &apos;t recognize it , this is going to be very painful .
and in a moment i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;ll see in the graph -- it starts in in in , , just before the women were starting to <unk> the job , and it goes to to to the day
you were up by up .
because i &apos;m about about a book , i i still still , , and i don &apos;t have answer .
and that was very very for them .
since we have &apos;t have this information yet , , come back to us in the form of culture , in this <unk> and and , where you can see that . .
there is no man , no woman who is in the middle , and the the the .
and the income income income on a scale that was constantly to to the to the , over that time , more than doubled .
and to hear me and understand what i say , you have about 60 bits per second .
and then it happens to the last book of me called &quot; good business , &quot; i &apos;ve interviewed some ceo who who from their in their environment as very successful and very ethical <unk> , with big social . .
and control is also a safe thing , because you you feel , you don &apos;t feel very .
&quot; where are you born , grew up and went to school ? &quot;
because when my grandparents were born , they had their own meaning of what home , and they had had their meaning for community , and even for the , which they were been by birth of birth . they didn &apos;t really have the opportunity to go
more and more people are in the future , or present , the the past .
i went down into the room i i to sleep .
<unk> <unk> : where are you home home ?
there was a big gap between the billion in the developed in the developed countries and the two billion in the developing world .
but that &apos;s the world that we have today . no gap .
and let me show you why i &apos;m to to the digital technology .
the survival of the the new green .
and again , they were better than we , &quot; your british and heart mortality is is is shocking . &quot;
but when you have people , you don &apos;t change the number of heart disease .
and i started to work with <unk> , , she she grow , and then i worked with <unk> -- mice that could &apos;t produce the gene .
one of the subjects was my my , , and of course , i don &apos;t know how old she &apos;s .
could you be the the the the the the the .
there &apos;s certainly many progress of many lot of <unk> lives .
this is even real photography , the time , , that that that the in the in a days .
and here you can see , what &apos;s going to six months later , that &apos;s the <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> is made from two different types types .
we &apos;ll it back into this <unk> device .
even more complex organs . with the the fundamentally , , , the , , the , , with a lot of <unk> <unk> organs like heart , liver and and .
this is still in the .
we prefer cells that are not <unk> and make no tumors .
we only need five seconds .
for any problem , any problem out there , any idea .
so , i &apos;m going to be a bit of , in it -- in all the and and sugar , i had -- but this is a really really .
it doesn &apos;t mean you have to go a a . .
i went to door door to door and sold the door .
it &apos;s like a recession . so there &apos;s a recession .
and you would make that chairs .
it &apos;s no . &quot; you have to to find a way to get faster .
i sold a lot of <unk> .
they don &apos;t get regular regular income , but they have the possibility to find more more tasks and learning , the ability ability to the , and they also learn the ability to find more ways .
if you go into a restaurant and and you &apos;re doing bad , you show you how bad <unk> are .
these boys , <unk> .
the development of the students is the to throw all of the interests on one .
the <unk> of <unk> or a <unk> of cultural <unk> , the of the students of our students students .
the past the past also also also . . that &apos;s a lot of society .
but it &apos;s a policy of principles , not the <unk> .
they have a spirit . and they have other people .
what we should to about , when we think about , -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- the -- -- is what &apos;s going to go .
yeah , i know you don &apos;t really believe it .
and this is not just a a different result , it has the potential to change the we we .
completely different .
actually , this is not a right organization , but -- let me finish this -- creative commons , writers -- a simple way to put their content in the the that they want to leave them .
john john . .
and i wonder how often it happened .
he told me that he he the the <unk> , and then said , &quot; there &apos;s a snake in the next room , and we &apos;re going to be <unk> . &quot;
so , for today , i had the idea that i &apos;m going to go through this process and &apos;m going to show you how this journey .
and the hospital and general <unk> were also happy .
i survived , just to understand that we .
i &apos;m &apos;m going to ask people , &quot; is it really possible to use this microbial ecosystems to our advantage ? &quot;
another way way , how microbes can spread is through the people , architects , and , and , to the to to the interaction , or the to the to the the of ideas in the and and offices .
imagine a design of the microbes , for , , for the plane or on a phone .
and nobody knew about it .
my company , <unk> , built a system called <unk> for the apple macintosh .
in was was the on the <unk> of the <unk> .
and greenpeace wanted to be the <unk> , and a a way that to to to that , was in in a <unk> <unk> .
in 78 percent of voices . to give you a idea of the <unk> victory , <unk> two , and a <unk> .
and the last message i &apos;d like to tell you is , you can be quite successful .
i think i don &apos;t need to explain what a great privilege of you is to stand today .
this is the school that was built with the community .
something that we have in gando are <unk> .
just that way .
good morning . magic is a good way to be the the the of the possible to do today , what the science is going to be .
there &apos;s the color red and the color black , they &apos;re going to go to the open shift from day . day .
voice : why not ? this is a very good sheet .
this is an illusion .
so this is china , a a , and not as a as a . .
but you can &apos;t lead a country as china , a a , on the base of it , a a system .
and the reason is , , first , the state state is gets a very special -- -- a very very very very , as the , , the embodiment and the <unk> of the chinese civilization , the <unk> .
he was in inches kilometers , , beijing beijing and shanghai .
we &apos;ve seen this in terms of the -- that the position of the <unk> of the <unk> -- or the <unk> .
he goes on on the <unk> , the the , and the the cars go underneath .
red is , , , , , , the green of green is the orange of , , , is the <unk> of .

they all all that that her picture wanted to to the each other .
&quot; you mean , you know , you know , a <unk> face -- that a face , , , right here ? &quot;
most most places that i i decided i decided to go to i had heard about you in the media .
i took more photos , and we started the project .
are you an an organization ? are you the media ? &quot;
so the roofs were were , , a woman , &quot; &quot; can see me . &quot;
because this is a big part of it . there are layers behind every picture .
but they basically have a promise .
or , &quot; how can we help . &quot;
when i think about the the and what you you you is now , i think , there &apos;s some factors i want to to give you a .
they have a trend .
zipcar , , , a decade , in 2000 2000 .
it think that &apos;s in to to to , and cities have been to be in participation .
it &apos;s very cheap , and it &apos;s very <unk> . &quot;
the last 40 years years was extraordinary times .
and it also miniaturization .
this would be a <unk> <unk> . .
it &apos;s vital that the at ted , ideas ideas that we think about , and the able to make sure that this is a particularly <unk> century , not a of <unk> and <unk> .
my family family are boring academics that to collect <unk> <unk> of our <unk> .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m here to meet the prime minister . &quot;
i thought he thought thought , but something of it was really . .
i sat , like you , in the audience .
this is another picture .
and i my career , my career , , it was going to get me a lot of success .
i started to the <unk> <unk> of human human human .
this time i said , let &apos;s try something else .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
sw : much better . einstein &apos;s very honored to go here at ted in in the in the of of einstein &apos;s . . in fact , it &apos;s very excited .
it would be very dangerous when you &apos;re down .

sw : great . .
sw : what &apos;s a <unk> ? ?
my parents found this important for your inner .

at this point , you can , you , you , , and they them , and they they they they they each other .
and she looked up up and said , &quot; well , that &apos;s better .
i think they think me that they look very good .
and so far , with 50,000 students , , , , , , a a dozen schools , my readers , by the way .

there &apos;s the the , men , and and with <unk> .
goliath &apos;s a prey . he &apos;s no a chance .
so goliath is to greater than the than the time , and usually , there &apos;s a explanation of it if there is so far outside the norm .
and i think that there &apos;s a very important lesson for us all .
and it turns out that we &apos;re covered by a <unk> , and these microbes do us actually well good , instead of killing us .
they &apos;ve all all the microbes and the the the the the .
most of these pills , or the <unk> that can eat , or two , perhaps five species , maybe five species , and human community has thousands of species .
we need a <unk> for for the microbes that live in and live in people , so we can understand what to do to our lives .
so many people think about the internet is really on english , but for us , it &apos;s truly global . us , there are in many , many languages .

we first we started to build ushahidi and and .
a call call in the united states , , , or china , five <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s built <unk> , so you can also a a a and and so in remote places .

the best definition of <unk> &apos; i i know -- she explains so much -- coming from <unk> gary marcus marcus . &quot;
it makes us very , very old <unk> . .

she went out the <unk> and and and .
and they say , &quot; hold your laws of my body . &quot;
and we have the signs of <unk> the right , <unk> is the <unk> god -- and both work together .
and so the answer , my opinion , i think , to to to to to the to the truth and try to make them into a better future for us .
but if you react , are a lot of other people in the environment that are innocent , but also , be be -- the military didn &apos;t want to talk about <unk> . .
we look at something else , &quot; and never seem seem to be very like the situations .
does someone have a commandment , how often often , if you think about how often the police used in in in the , in in ?

we have started to to in our &quot; &quot; . .

and i &apos;ll tell you about about it , but just ...
but he also moved over here to other people who did the same as he did .
this is &quot; <unk> . &quot;

there &apos;s the glamour of physics .
and in fact , we see see these <unk> photos of stars all the time -- they call it <unk> .
they don &apos;t looking at about one way , but you have to be your your world .
<unk> , that <unk> <unk> <unk> , is glamorous .
but it &apos;s going to be an illusion that if you buy that lamp , you &apos;ll live in a world without wires .
the perfect <unk> -- -- is through the perfect chain , with perfect <unk> .
because glamour can be very <unk> and and .
but i did know how hard they were working for the week .

and it was , you know , i think , a a class .
and secondly , it &apos;s possible possible , or , , , , , slow down ?
they want to go back to an <unk> rhythm .
and norway , sweden , denmark and finland are under the six <unk> nations of the world and work hours , where the average americans would be .

i &apos;m the the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> a <unk> task on my <unk> , , because they were so slowly , and i wanted to get done .
and so all the the start , and they said , &quot; you can &apos;t build everything in a island ; part of it must be on the , because we don &apos;t want to convert ourselves from the community . &quot;
i worked on months and i didn &apos;t get it because i felt that people who came from the historical , , , , , and if you can see a museum , and you can &apos;t process it .

night before i looked at night , i looked at , , i i , &quot; how am i going to do this ? &quot;
next -- oh , , , . these guys are the community .
so i was pretty successful . and if you &apos;ve all this that , what is it that you , ? i &apos;ve told about the <unk> and and other things , but what what what what ?
at my last tedtalk , about seven years ago .
but carl norden is really the the code .
whenever the norden bombsight has been into an airplane , it becomes accompanied by a series of <unk> . .
the <unk> is <unk> on three three square square .
after the war , , there was a scientific scientific -- as the army , the force always does -- and they asked the question : how many <unk> of , did we actually destroyed ?
i described to you the opposite of a success story .
a walk in a city city or a a of a a of the human species in the amazing way .
we ask asking to the human human .
but what &apos;s the that that the ? ?
imagine that that would have to <unk> .
it was a african that is the world the world &apos;s diversity .
the sahara was much bigger than today .
the people who are the animals that they were into the <unk> , they went to the , and and about about about about about years ago , the the east in the middle east in a rare <unk> phase of the sahara .
the <unk> , <unk> on mars .
we know deep in our hearts that the universe is not moving from to to .
so there we go .
what you see here is the blue areas are about a of of than than the red are .
they &apos;re the than than gravity than gravity , what explains why you and i have smaller than the stars and planets .
they &apos;re be familiar with the double of of dna .
let me explain explain why .
in the last 200 years , something else happened .
now you might ask yourself , &quot; what &apos;s talking about ? &quot;
we &apos;re not as good when it &apos;s about .
and then you need to decide how they invest in their 52 choices , and they never heard of a <unk> . .
at least a a study that it &apos;s predicted .
but if you get the driver &apos;s driver , you you the the , you you want to to to to . organs .
the other group gets two apples , a gets taken .
save more tomorrow just does it .
that &apos;s just one example .
it &apos;s a song about a called a <unk> , , an creature that which is an creature that again .
hello , who is there , please ?
thank you .
this is a lot of impact on the .
i &apos;m trying to <unk> time .
so what did i do ?
we invent stories to explain our existence .
so what did they do ? they sent her her walter raleigh to separate their human part of your <unk> .
do you have a child ?
elizabeth : <unk> out ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i went to visit a friend of mine and he &apos;d waiting me for in in <unk> hill in the the floor , a really very rich area in mumbai .
everything is a contradiction .
we lived from less than a dollar a day -- for about 15 years .
and you have got to start from the the of the that forests as as as than than than than than . . &quot;
he said , &quot; you can &apos;t <unk> a person to sleep . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about people ; it &apos;s about <unk> .
if on a limited planet , you &apos;re all the , , how can we do this ?
coke has to work with pepsi .
these are nine of it .
and at the end , i think , 60 percent of the world &apos;s production at the table and 25 percent of the <unk> .
that &apos;s not important .
but you don &apos;t buy the juice ; they &apos;re buy the carbon in the trees , the the the of the the <unk> the the the product of the product to europe .
so the communication is interrupted the brain and the spinal cord , and this causes a full and and and of the <unk> .
after a few years , we &apos;ve been able to develop a <unk> <unk> <unk> that the the system system of the spinal cord in a <unk> .
we &apos;ve been working on this to to to this goal .
after a couple of weeks , we we a a pump to take a a <unk> into the spinal cord .
and i was a child of the . .
he was talking about the world , it &apos;s &quot; and the world , as it should be . &quot;
and by doing this , , , these women are many obstacles from the way .
in the white house , and the desk that &apos;s sitting called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
the last day , the woman who who were there to do everything , and we talked about each other , and suddenly suddenly told me , &quot; would you sing me me ? &quot;
for this is a <unk> of a <unk> to the voice , because it &apos;s mysterious -- as you can see -- it &apos;s completely , , and it &apos;s originally .
they didn &apos;t have that .
so the the internet takes <unk> and instructions .
one of the most popular websites in the world that will done by the most powerful company in the world , and there was nothing that are not to be youtube or more .
and today wikipedia wikipedia is is so <unk> that you can even find them in the maps of the in china .
and that &apos;s what wikipedia .
this is a blog that &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
why ? there &apos;s a <unk> in <unk>
the world did not in the 90s .
and we see that the impact of the is in the in in some countries , very , very strong .
all of it costs money .
and it became a lot to to students students with <unk> , or social small families are the same opportunities .
how are schools and teachers in the media ?
in the , the teachers are going to left the class and and they have a lot of <unk> .
some people say that the change the the the the the the a <unk> . .
but if you look at the issue from this perspective , then you see what happened in the last 60 years .
and i walked around the whole morning about 15 kilometers to get to the the . .
so this was obviously a <unk> device .
we could also do that with phones .
so a business of them .
&quot; the government has to provide economic <unk> services . &quot;
it was , long ago , long ago , when i was 24 years old , i was at the the of of a college college in bangalore .
and you can see my map , when i &apos;m them here .
and i &apos;m a invention with .
now we &apos;re in the 1930s , and you see that japan are going by a of of war , with lower life life .
and they decided to invest in health health and education , but they also started to grow economy .
washington , d.c. , i went out .
not the bubble , not my bubbles , but the financial bubble .
the once that once used to really accept a completely changed a whole global global global power power power , where they were over over the last 50 to 100 years , to the to asia ?
the rest of the diagram is a very mysterious substance called &quot; dark energy .
but that explains the presence of the all the mass .
and now you that that we we live in in three-dimensional universe -- a three-dimensional space .
again , this is a kind of <unk> model of what &apos;s going on .
they move moving off each other , because space is going to bigger .
by looking at things like these -- their <unk> , , how many of you have time as a function of time -- we can get in experience , in a way to the dark matter and dark energy in to to structures .
the great questions in physics .
so , you banjo boys : <unk> <unk> out -- new jersey ?
so , recycling and and are <unk> here .
marc <unk> : where million of reasons to invent the
and in fact , this change in gay men in the u.s. states during the 1980s .
it &apos;s a disease that kills a lot of adults in africa , and many children .
in uganda , we see that the . .
it makes it similar similar to similar .
but openness and and , a price of if we think of diseases . that should not be surprise .
coffee is <unk> <unk> .
emily <unk> : looking at the aids statistics in africa from a economic perspective and and comes to a surprising conclusion : all our knowledge of hiv on the continent is wrong .
but i fascinated me because i watched this kind of <unk> italian <unk> .
he was <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , , because he was the front of the , and every time he was into a tunnel , he was a a <unk> , , he was a a <unk> . the tunnel was always a
this this is the water water water .
then we ask ourselves why the the membrane and and and why it &apos;s needed much electricity .
for example , in the <unk> of <unk> in the material .
at <unk> <unk> , my <unk> , , we work with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
janine benyus : biomimicry in
&quot; yes , but why ? &quot;
we were four , not one , and for happiness , not a boy .
you can &apos;t do it .
it &apos;s never happening in india , because that &apos;s , once , and never .
they said , &quot; yes . &quot; i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s pray . &quot;
this was a <unk> for over 1,000 number of in in this prison .
second , it &apos;s about the <unk> movement in india .
so let me tell you about a project that we made a years later , a of a of a of .
it &apos;s basically power by an old book .
the number of sides that we use the is actually so high that the number of words that we &apos;re seeing a a a day , very big .
some are more funny .
now , the web is <unk> up with several languages .
then my <unk> &apos;s my <unk> .
there &apos;s a way to beat two to a .
but what &apos;s still surprising , the the that we get from the <unk> , even if you &apos;re just <unk> , the the that we get are also just as the the professional <unk> , , and that &apos;s very surprising .
and people they learn learning value , they don &apos;t pay for money , they pay pay with their time .
the the side , the company , what it is really good .
<unk> to the in the part is to be normal .
and zipcar has a very , , service service , that &apos;s done .
for aristotle , the the the the , the the to to the the . .
maybe those people have right . his thoughts , , perhaps not good .
ten percent of the time , the the thought -- ... sex .
i played the violent african , the african terrorists .
well , the first first <unk> , the first <unk> of the the first , , -- so no one had the the the most the most , -- the elections in a second , three weeks later .
here &apos;s a interesting comparison .
so i went to la <unk> and i learned that .
the people in the 17th century didn &apos;t really much of how we we that this stuff is a bunch of different molecules , and we &apos;re it out of a reason and so that .
and so , charles said , i &apos;m going to make money to give you a building , and you can meet there , but don &apos;t talk about religion .
reality is what you can see .
i thought everybody was a little bit of mind that .
just to see what would happen if you pick the both together .
so i &apos;ve got something else that &apos;s not personally .
if you &apos;re going to be rich today , you want to be .
they say , when you &apos;re the temperature of the atmosphere , it &apos;s &apos;t you -- they &apos;re not at all , we &apos;re in the , and we &apos;re very carefully in the , , and it &apos;s &apos;t .
dr. kary mullis talks the the basis of modern science : the experiment . he told stories stories from the 17th century and his own <unk> of the garden and <unk> , and and and care of science and care of the of of .
i wanted to represent a a a a body , which these <unk> , , spaces .
&quot; <unk> city is a a for new york and &quot; <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> and <unk> that from the feeling of the in in urban environment .
i love to travel , and berlin is become a of my favorite . .
and all the time i &apos;ve seen a single rat on some of those places until recently when i was in in london in the
the first question is , and maybe you write them on , either of paper , like , , , or a a a a a a , in your head , and you can see it .
and we we with , we we are the best <unk> college college in the world , &quot; because of our british <unk> .
except that -- they &apos;re going -- well , in your <unk> , , you thought , &quot; well , what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
and one of the most difficult problems is , when people have have a idea of how everything works , it &apos;s quite difficult to change that .
and as an expert of of , i have friends and colleagues , the the areas between organic , living world , the world world ,
and you can see , he <unk> , <unk> , , in a way .
we even have quite incredible forms we can manipulate .
and darwin himself in a letter to a a idea guess that life probably probably did in a warm , maybe in a warm -- maybe not in scotland , maybe maybe in africa , maybe somewhere else
what is life ? what is this stuff of life ?
and we can connect them and and and and thousands of thousands of thousands of people , to the same size of dna and proteins , but it &apos;s not carbon carbon .
we want to put them into the environment , and we want them to get their energy from the sun .
and i think if we can make there biology biology and make matter and to it , , it will actually define life .
but there &apos;s another second reason why i like this <unk> : every one makes one .
and these are high professional female interviewer who sit on an hour with a woman and they &apos;re asking them to their <unk> .
i was sitting in friday in my computer , and i could see the mortality of the from the from the <unk> of .
as you know , we love this economists , they want to , and more and more of it .
as you can see , it doesn &apos;t make a sense of a average on a of a improvement that no and that very fast progress .
but you don &apos;t talk about that much .
in those who were high , , very high , child mortality and the families were also very big , six to eight .
here &apos;s also . .
whatever is is more value for money .
yes , i went to to the , i was 12 .
and he told them , &quot; it &apos;s the <unk> .
all the time was a border .
and <unk> , , my opinion , the world will going to make a difference , not just a few , but for for everybody .
... above the knee , yes , that would be difficult .
the <unk> -- it took about 10 years and 700 million dollars .
he said , &quot; the earth enough enough to engage everybody needs , but not everybody everybody .
and <unk> die .
i went to high school .
when i was at the the of scientific research research -- 40 labs -- two two <unk> , who didn &apos;t have each each other , , i built teams .
they &apos;re being able to see , and now i &apos;ve apps in the store store .
it &apos;s about perfect something old and something old to something to something .
it &apos;s still hot , but not more <unk> .
but there &apos;s not the the of the , and and is not as an , , means that the the don &apos;t have the the of the .
i i believe that the reactor that i &apos;ve designed here , a innovative source of source , the great scientific projects of the , and i &apos;m really ready to do this .
we &apos;re moving to a <unk> , where the experience is the actual product .
there &apos;s a french that for the the the case that they go in the forest .
and finally , a long long of , , he his his his son , he says , &quot; &quot; especially , , <unk> you , <unk> yourself .
you don &apos;t usually go much in los angeles , but there &apos;s a place where you can walk a lot of out out in this city .
then they &apos;re going to be wrong as a <unk> -- by these characteristics that they don &apos;t have .
when i was small , i was very an , and i was just me for me alone .
then it only about about to start to a point and then build it to the . .
so i made it made from concrete , it doesn &apos;t matter .
that was this tool .
and for me , this is the most important thing , because since i &apos;ve been a kid , i wanted to put my passion and love .
25 days , the <unk> <unk> &#93; <unk> , 32 and , and hands develop 36 days : the primitive spine begins to to to these weeks , which is the the the the the the the fastest .
the complexity , this in a single system , again , every of of understanding , any of .
because apparently , there &apos;s this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> not in the atmosphere of stars stars .
so what can you do with these ? ?
recently recently sent a colleague colleague , <unk> , <unk> , , an an interesting spectrum , and said , &quot; can you look look at it ? &quot;
there are two ways of the -- about <unk> and <unk> stars -- which matter and chemical elements in the universe and and and .
because can you imagine that everything all <unk> ?
now imagine an object , an incredible object , or something that we can &apos;t explain , and we &apos;re just and and and say , &quot; so , we &apos;re . physics . &apos;t work
and if we see <unk> , oxygen , oxygen , then i think , we have the perfect
i just said , &quot; really ? &quot; and he &apos;s , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
what i can tell you is , it &apos;s universal ; we all have them .
i &apos;m easy to <unk> , but that &apos;s another talk .
this led to a little -- -- -- that actually , so that &apos;s what
and i said , &quot; but the thing is : no <unk> , no <unk> . &quot;
what do you feel be be be be ? ? &quot;
i &apos;m right , you don &apos;t right . stop the . .
we do like that we do what we do , not a impact on other people .
people are their their meals in twitter , the <unk> of their children on your iphone .
so if we think about it to do to make systematic improvements , we think think about how it can be useful to our <unk> , for our our and and .
and today i want to talk about one of the things that we decided to do at then , we wanted to find a new access to health care .
so steven &apos;s me a little story . but he &apos;s not alone .
this is what people pray .
i also also have this <unk> , , , , they were the only <unk> that were online and available .
and here &apos;s a paper here .
you have no <unk> , you don &apos;t data , that &apos;s not to scientific them .
this is the curve on the <unk> .
but my brother didn &apos;t do with him .
so , when we went from from here today , we would go up to something that &apos;s 300 feet high , 120 miles , , , , a few of wide , and that &apos;s two
to change the state , you only need two volts of a <unk> .
we said , &quot; can you build this ? &quot;
we can do better .
but there &apos;s a fascinating solution that comes out of what &apos;s called <unk> .
and , are networks are of a of of complex systems .
and it has also implications to the risk risk .
so we could put a <unk> <unk> .
we see the <unk> <unk> and <unk> programs that are to to our our our world world of the complexity .
<unk> have a capacity capacity with <unk> <unk> -- -- unless you pump expensive pump and valves .
and we had been prepared 500 of these . .
without human human . .
so we were up on our our <unk> .
and this graph doesn &apos;t even even something that data data .
and my brain starts very quickly to think that this is a <unk> representation of <unk> of <unk> in the world .
because this question is that our external world can predict our our our , but the truth is that i only can predict 10 percent of the person &apos;s <unk> , if i <unk> their entire external world .
and that &apos;s for two reasons for for , , and and wrong .
we &apos;re moving people to open up , you open up , a <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of someone to someone in their social environment .
to say -- a <unk> , , you know , you know , my father was the <unk> man in the world .
and so i was . i went to to , her .
they said , do it stop .
you take a huge disk from cardboard .
he was the first digital media in in tokyo .
do you hear that ? as cows ? this is 4 o in .
so there &apos;s all these things , but most of love , i love to the world to taste .
and i tried this passion .
your culture is not in schools , and i want to to you ways of how we can overcome this problem .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re nervous because girls don &apos;t want to go schools where there are no boys .
and i have about little moments in my life .
or mothers who have brought the young ?
we need to change the attitude by the young in school school .
and you have the impression that you believe that would be okay .
let &apos;s see where we &apos;re going to .
is this a problem ? yes , a big problem .
we believe that why &quot; why &quot; why &quot; why &quot; <unk> evidence of the basic principles of nature .
i &apos;ll going to try and i , i &apos;m i &apos;m so excited , whether it works .
and that was really a important lesson for me , you can &apos;t really have a object .
so we have created paper paper , a a a a a a newspaper .
it &apos;s a radio down with my ipad , and that &apos;s a software that on on the ipad .
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add a <unk> , so i <unk> it to a a a , so that people respond to the glass , the people are in the the the the glass .
from my i i &apos;m going to <unk> a man , a , , and then a old man .
<unk> extra allowed to
radio : what do you think of it ?
fold it up the wings and go on .
so i i think you a different question .
and he &apos;d put a <unk> <unk> <unk> , with <unk> who had to , , he had to <unk> , and and night , but with the secret instruction , didn &apos;t really them to
because they &apos;ve found that that the human behavior is the .
but we have to make a an <unk> <unk> <unk> where you can create this kind of value , and it &apos;s a much fair .
now , we all have these tools , we have to put the question -- and and and and and and and we have this , how we use these intelligent smart .
they &apos;re the new new <unk> .
they give up little , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i felt passion , passion , soul and heart , had my body .
audience : no .
sb : no , not no . &quot;
all around us , , , , , a a a a replicator into this culture of culture .
they &apos;ve got it .
imagine the world full of brains and more and more memes than than than than you &apos;re there .
we are the only <unk> and and <unk> .
i think that &apos;s the wrong approach .
that was dangerous , but it &apos;s . .
they use us to make the the of the planet to produce more and more and more and more more , that we hear here at ted .
and will we get this third risk of how we have the second and the first ? ?
in collaboration with <unk> -- that &apos;s the <unk> in haiti -- the the department of the public , , with different <unk> , , we we more than 1,500 buildings .
it won &apos;t going to cost us more when we do it right . &quot;
and because i had a to a a of of my body , it took the one an hour .
we also found that it was been good , i would have been to to back to the to the pain .
and how bad would be be the punishment , if i was ? ?
it wasn &apos;t that the <unk> people -- the , the , scientists were <unk> -- less <unk> -- the less religious -- those who never never never <unk> for commandments -- more <unk> .
so if you &apos;re not any any any any any of any seconds , you you &apos;re a brand , it makes a difference ?
because it &apos;s like this .
i think all of these forces are very bad impact on the market .
but you can believe me . i work in the . .
these are the <unk> that i can show you today .
and suddenly , amazon will be to brand and and with the <unk> , , as you want to spend money money , what money is and what &apos;s what it is .
maybe it seems to be a to ?
i i don &apos;t have to explain it , i i had to explain -- last week i had to explain it to -- -- -- -- -- -- are are from by an individual to another . .
and i knew that animals like the <unk> , , , , or most most animals don &apos;t stabilize their tissue by been off on bones
and that was that every point that we found that we had in nature , the same <unk> had had the same . .
everybody i showed this , was really surprised .
a funny thing song about global warming , jill sobule .
well , i have to be .
all right , ok .
do we want to play a piece ?
<unk> , <unk> and <unk> , , are the benefits of a great education .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> completely out of this , and ben got to a <unk> . .
so , on , what is the area of this character ?
i was forced to leave my home to leave the democratic republic of congo where where i was <unk> .
but <unk> <unk> has been the the of the united nations the the of the the of the the .
but we &apos;re not at the goal .
they &apos;d have to have very powerful .
but couldn &apos;t you be done for this point of the .
they were to to the governments of governments , and in many cases they have you have .
but let &apos;s take our goal , our goal is to to to to the the of the the .
because they need a whole bunch of of little <unk> to to make their profit .
he liked it to on her lap because he said it was painful for him in your own bed .
for , , for <unk> , <unk> <unk> and the british society for <unk> , that that that is the sun is .
so , what &apos;s fusion ? here .
and this energy is that the fusion . .
it &apos;s like this as a a like a .
we have to make it power power .
but it &apos;s the largest arab country , and it &apos;s a huge impact .
in fact , they were most of the , , but they were all the countries the population of the the the the the the the the the the the had been to to a did only four percent .
but the expectations of people for their future value .
so the question is to , &quot; what does the mean for women &apos;s for ? &quot;
i promise you , she &apos;s read the message .
no one can listen listen , they &apos;re just a to . .
you could see the immediate impact of laws , or the a <unk> talk on a <unk> , and see what happens .
the fly took 12 seconds and went about 35 .
this is a for a rocket .
it weighs less than a <unk> . .
from the smallest <unk> to the the forces of of nature .
we can afford in as individuals and and and .
we believe believe that someone else else , somebody , somebody , , somebody with more means that we have to solve .
we were not the the the pacific .
it took 10 full full of , until we had something that was flew .
and so there &apos;s a one side of this incredible incredible <unk> , which is possible , and this huge thing that means .
and let &apos;s think of our moral mouth .
and the director was pretty <unk> , and told me that he thought me crazy , and he said to me , &quot; this place is a <unk> . these guys are heavy . .
it needed several of those events until i what i should do .
when i started this program , four years ago , my <unk> was a <unk> <unk> to create a <unk> of .
and they look down down , it &apos;s so small and tiny .
i feel blessed and happy that i had the courage to go to go on at at at at &apos; and back in my home country where i went to these these these group of <unk> , in this group of ethiopia , and and russia .
and how often would say my self , i would i to understand that it didn &apos;t exist before ?
and i was a really good dancer .
well , , , these these these these these these these <unk> , , of otherness .
that was because i didn &apos;t have any another another in .
imagine what kind of existence we we if we honor the the of of the , the privilege of life , and to to what &apos;s going next .
and this is a cafe in the ocean .
but instead of what we focused on on the way we focused on .
we discovered also discovered that a <unk> structure and a a way through that structure .
but we realized that seeds -- this really important project is that , instead -- but that seeds -- in the leading <unk> of <unk> doesn &apos;t stop .
we were working with a <unk> system to develop a <unk> of of the <unk> , , even if you &apos;re a , , it kind of <unk> and soft , the piece of landscape that you see here .
it &apos;s actually the first few of the that you you , and the rest of the .
the book is the &quot; &quot; the blank slate &quot; , the popular idea of the mind is a blank slate , and all its structure of its <unk> , culture , education and experience .
well , there &apos;s a series of political reasons that they like well .
and , by the way , it &apos;s not yet , that that that are are , , but then the the the the to to .
another other of the and <unk> and the universities , in are in in in in in decline .
now , the other hot iron is the . .
and i think that can &apos;t even say this better .
i also call <unk> <unk> , just like this , and , and they don &apos;t like it , but they &apos;re it .
there &apos;s no script script there there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no nonsense .
he says , &quot; a day . &quot;
i don &apos;t like what i &apos;m going on . &quot;
oh , i live in a computer program , that &apos;s strange .
so i asked what would happen if we challenge some of these <unk> <unk> .
right ?
it &apos;s the way -- we have the the war , as a society , each of us .
your iphone without the people , the the the the same the , the same keyboard , over and over and over and over and over .
and it &apos;s been more much and more and and and and now it &apos;s <unk> for .
and i said to brian , what did tony did tony ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; is it true that you have in the in the ? &quot;
but how do you sit in an rich way ?

and it &apos;s a <unk> . . &quot;
and the end , we we change ourselves , we we the world world around us .
that &apos;s going to have incredible impact .
why do they do what they do ?
everybody would want the new version .
they affect us too much .

his impact is the distribution of this very thin <unk> of the all the planet , and we had a very <unk> death of the dinosaurs , death of this beautiful <unk> , <unk> , , and and and so much else .
it &apos;s the the <unk> , the <unk> of of of time .
they hate us animals .
that &apos;s when the material is from the deep and the surface , the surface , the the surface of the planet .
i &apos;m a from from the coast , what will happen to me ?

human rights is to a very simple question : can i give this people to
or whatever the the to find the the the the beginning to see the fire , to see if you can change it . &quot;

after the <unk> of <unk> in indonesia , i started to study conditions of poverty in a country that was to the . .
a hospital of the doctors without the , &quot; in a refugee camp .
the <unk> is is so efficient that the the of of the soldiers , a a <unk> in this war in in in in in in in our history .
to make sure that little as possible could be wrong , we have all of these <unk> in choice .
so you can them .
but this is a and and pretty difficult topic , so i had to to . .
the size of the population -- here is big china , here , here . india .
and in all eastern religions , japan was the level .
because the death of a child &apos;s <unk> with another child .
and what is the the of qatar ?
they have a great <unk> .
all religions are able to get their values , and and to to to the new world .
and then , like all of our generation , we lived in a <unk> . .
day eight .
in india , my my my my my friends , and i me door to door to the same picture , every single house in india . we made over a billion .
this is the <unk> . .
i asked her -- it &apos;s all <unk> -- and i put them those questions you want to ask them .
i think we we made the and and ron st. john a lot of gratitude , i hope , is in the audience in the the -- there &apos;s the founder of of . .
larry brilliant : first , , are they not angry because of the the of
i built a <unk> , &quot; the climate group .
why should we want a positive impact on the world , want to the world as a company ?
they &apos;re about 85 percent of an led that they used used to used with an old bulb bulb .
sometimes people think that 100 percent of the be be hard , and we had this conversation in the company .
a <unk> paid paid themselves in seven or eight years .
from our our , , , percent percent , , but that &apos;s not enough , and we want to close this gap and and to to the far far management .
there was one equation in my family , like , you &apos;re smart , you &apos;re not <unk> .
this , it , he wrote , &quot; the is the the structure of reality . &quot;
anyone , that you you , or or your view out of the ears .
so the end of our <unk> , we realized the openness of the other .
as i &apos;d be back to bangalore and and a few few of in my friends , where we had different subjects , as they <unk> <unk> about new <unk> , , where a drink of often cost than what they paid their 14 years of
he &apos;s waiting for forgiveness , and says he he wants to improve the life of of child child .
this <unk> seemed seemed quite happy to be happy , and it had no deaths were not been were been were killed dozens of dozens of liberia .
and how how we are responsible ?
it &apos;s serious -- not ? -- that the media the world make a hard job that a a group of activists have able to publish more from the information of information information than the rest of the <unk> . .
j yeah . this was the front in in the guardian , and then it was in all around kenya around kenya , in the <unk> and south south the press .

i would just interested in the only of what we &apos;ve heard -- i &apos;m curious about the the ted audience .

so you have got to be careful with the term .
and just a month ago , it was passed from the <unk> parliament .
and all of all these numbers , i &apos;m going to just just two or three variables .
this piece can be very different , , depending on where you &apos;re <unk> it .
first i read about this in a a in a <unk> , and and <unk> and and and and and .
so , according to this this , the best <unk> of for a chicken not to to a , , but not to long , , it &apos;s a black and a a of of of a , sugar sugar or
and then , i was working under the the in the <unk> of dr. <unk> at <unk> <unk> <unk> , texas .
and this realization is incredible for efficiency efficiency of chemotherapy , perhaps for many different cancer cancer .
for example , more organic , chemical pollutants , in our schools , care and work .
because all those solutions are , of course , they are sustainable and they &apos;re <unk> -- <unk> for our generation and for the generations .
and immediately immediately , a voice : &quot; ! ! &quot;
after after the conference , after my talk , people came to me , men and women .
hard !
a prosthetic is not more for the need to lack lack lack of . .
we &apos;re all different of different perspectives .
i was when beijing was to to the the of the .

and they &apos;re most unemployment , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> of europe and america of products that they make .
they have a kind of tools that you can get them on a piece piece chicken or fish , and it looks like how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how . .
people think think think think think about is : will we going to to our environment to the ?
there there there is nothing to eat , but the conditions were ideal for the <unk> .
now , the series was not still on it , so they &apos;re the first ones to see that .
it &apos;s more than than the the earth , it seems to be as the as the .
well , was afraid that we have the opportunity to lose the quote quote &quot; &quot; . they would take us .
but more importantly , bmi became the the work of work , to generate new new of , that they <unk> for free for their clients , and in the , , as a <unk> of of the , , , the majority of the . .
i ... i ...
for the , for the , i &apos;m trying to do , i am trying to do a of of , , , , to a a of the government , , , , right ?
this is a incredible <unk> , , , <unk> .

but another study , that , that that there in three times of the first 10 minutes of their . .
here &apos;s <unk> with her <unk> .
i &apos;ll say it again .
now don &apos;t say , don &apos;t tell you into the eyes .
we say , &quot; yes , we &apos;re us your head .
science has made a lot more more to the daylight .
look at look , and you &apos;re see the the <unk> smile .
in this much more <unk> world , it can be sense for us to be a little bit more be a little bit more be in our
and that &apos;s not true , right ?
you know , we think think that language the world that we live in , , , but that &apos;s not true .
so what what &apos;s <unk> when , if not just a , of the gets to be <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
six months after that , without any any any any any any , , they put me free .
that &apos;s what i was . .
when i was 10 , i was james <unk> <unk> <unk> country &quot; and and this book , i &apos;m broken .

many more people were have have .
today i &apos;m going to tell you two things , first , what we have lost , and secondly , we we get it .
you can see the most of the creatures of the living of the <unk> .
if there &apos;s a a a a a a , because it &apos;s <unk> protected , or , , it &apos;s great .
after a few years , after seven to seven years , the fish come back , the <unk> , and and then the algae grow back .
you can see the border of the <unk> , because they &apos;re all the <unk> .
if it &apos;s so good , if it &apos;s so , , much is it ?
so the protection of the , and the ocean has become a a of of governments and and institutions , and that &apos;s not <unk> .
in the coral reefs , we found that the the is the the of the the is where five lions come on a <unk> .

it &apos;s got to be the the largest creature in the ocean .
they come to the submarine -- they come to the eyes and look at the base .
among other , we &apos;re going to do with our partners at the woods , this virtual world -- this this this place to get the in the lab .
bl : these worms don &apos;t have <unk> . they have no mouth .
so what we &apos;ve seen was from the pacific .
we &apos;re going to try to show you the pacific in the . .
these worms are growing up for inches of the week .
the concept of the is is . .
and the rest of one percent are looking for the formula that they can apply to the situation .
they also have the mathematical structure , the <unk> , , , measurements , dots , places , and . .
students have to make these . . they have to make it .
and the best , or one of the best parts , is we &apos;re not going to get the the the the of the the .
what what happened to the small hadron collider ?
here you find the the the the world &apos;s the world .
they &apos;re <unk> . there are no government schools in the slums .
this is a computer that was on the entrance to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> named a woman named joan mitra , who who who who who who showed that children who can learn from certain conditions , <unk> on a computer .

so , people have to be people their job , so they don &apos;t show you who are , here , at home , it &apos;s not just to north carolina ; it &apos;s not it &apos;s legal .
think about it .
and i got fear .
about three years ago , i read an article in new york times .
who was my grandparents ?
it helps us to become what we could have been .
that &apos;s how evolution works .
and in fact , here &apos;s this insect .
i i started to just start of someone .
he &apos;s not just to 43 at 43 or 44 degrees for about two days , but he &apos;s a a .
but the contrast is going to be like this . you &apos;re going to <unk> in front of the background .
here you have the the russians , and yes , it was -- -- a game .
she started to me , and and all parents are the <unk> .
i have a <unk> of . .
our life is <unk> by data , and the presentation is this data is to to create a to a a of a a of a to tell the great stories .

<unk> bell : : , , , <unk> <unk> : , and we took all all these pieces and and and they &apos;re into another mechanical turk .
but we knew we were the right person to do the right person to make us and and we could build something .
and underneath that the individual <unk> that have have to the the project .
thank you .
so i made photographs of pictures , cut , and i it in <unk> .
a a consequence of it is that you always see a of of the image , and that leads to a very free <unk> .
and sometimes i have a emotional reaction on news , like the earthquake in haiti 2010 .
then i went 50 kilometers , then 60 kilometers .
it &apos;s like the different layers we we are , and what we &apos;re the the world as our identity .
another <unk> is in in a public library in san jose , california .
so every building has your own personality .
it &apos;s been easier easier to be a to to a good end up .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re particularly <unk> .
it &apos;s just too strange .
you know , in the middle middle middle , in england , if you met somebody who was very poor , you called a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is , which happiness , the fate , not <unk> , , was a
and that will going to go the recent recent dish , with angels and <unk> , and the sky will open up .
i told them the the of of <unk> .

if you used to , the digital radio , the the <unk> , and the <unk> , , and the the news , that that this this this .
the basic idea idea of the <unk> is is that you have two information information that are choices .
that means that i have to predict the future .
well , there &apos;s a very clear example , where a of me was very very different than it was been it from another person person .
and in the meantime i got two daughters .
so they didn &apos;t know the rules , the the the other person .
if those dots were on on a <unk> , , they would have no idea what &apos;s going on .
we &apos;ve shown that we can explain to a huge part of the data -- people are actually planning to resources to the the the negative consequences of the noise .
this is from the <unk> . .
mars has the biggest <unk> of the solar system , the <unk> .
this is my <unk> . it was taken a a few weeks ago .
the oldest rock on earth is only a billion .
and the result of our meeting was a <unk> <unk> called <unk> .
we fold it , and we transport it into a <unk> . .
this is over <unk> , oregon .
i think in the reason , let &apos;s look here -- &quot; eight to 12 . &quot;
and there was a guy who sold sold this guns for lego because lego -- -- -- -- no , you don &apos;t get to guns .
and then there are some examples of examples are are really sculptures .
i have to tell you , for me , that evening had changed everything .
perhaps most important thing is the impact on other companies is enormous .
in fact , politics is <unk> .
in brazil , there are <unk> <unk> , whereas the united united only only 700 , and <unk> in in california -- and within three years , the percentage of percent of percent up on percent percent percent .
this is not <unk> . and are are a really big thing .
scientists , scientists -- and these are just estimates -- that we need to cut the energy from greenhouse greenhouse greenhouse , and that as fast as possible .
i can &apos;t wait to what we &apos;re tedsters to the the crisis .
there are always less less people who are still available to be , , and you get this <unk> of the curve , and you get this classic <unk> curve .
b is on the edge of the network .
and this is happening on any outer nodes .
the red dots are going to be the <unk> , , and the yellow dots are friends are friends of people &apos;s friends .
would you get <unk> on <unk> ?
and there &apos;s , i think , three ways that can can be used to be that data data .
the building was in to the collapse of the <unk> economy and death of the &apos; the of the &apos; 90s .
although though it seems to be a very , place , if you see it from it , there is a whole whole of of <unk> and channels that are each single house .
in this tradition shows the future bride , all their their their their their their her new husband .
what &apos;s a place like the <unk> david david is especially remarkable , is this kind of <unk> , where people have a basis of the that they can use .
we can only ask , &quot; how does the <unk> of of the <unk> ? &quot; and -- and what we want to ask or what we want to ask .
it &apos;s replaced the workers through technology .
you can see on the screen on the screen , the show the size of the right arm .
they &apos;re older , and they &apos;re always older .
or even if we get older , we &apos;re going to drive our cars , so we can go to . .
they were gone in a moment .
it &apos;s always more obvious that we can &apos;t win .
the two specialists behind the the , the the to me the the the the screen .
one of the journalists asked , &quot; what happens going on ? &quot;
the <unk> are <unk> , as jewish <unk> .
i think there &apos;s some , , , , many reasons , but there &apos;s just some of the things we &apos;re just on .
he was <unk> by the , he would would it , he was like a <unk> a light , a little bit of a .
let me go on the door to the international community and see if someone have <unk> or troops for these . .
but it was too late for sergio .
he saw it .
<unk> power : a complicated hero
this is the jobs and possibilities all the the .
but today i &apos;m going to talk about the the of food , this year , year year , and 2008 and 2008 in the <unk> of the <unk> . for every <unk> pounds of calories .
and i go in this stores , if you &apos;re there , or or in the the fields to see what you can get , and i &apos;m , , you can &apos;t get food .
we see in the of in schools schools schools .
i want to talk about something that call the digital food .
and what i found is that they are in and and and and and things invest in in a school school .
thank you .
we could do the same thing with cancer .
they &apos;re going to go to a <unk> . .
it &apos;s not abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
it &apos;s a <unk> device , not because it shows me how many <unk> i i <unk> every day , but because it &apos;s a long time of what i do .
it &apos;s never shown .
the <unk> of these magnets is so big that we can see with this technology in this technology .
you don &apos;t have to to the tumor .
when the magnet is big , and your resolution up high , , you can actually actually the proteins in the body , and start to understand the individual system .
most of us find that , and interestingly , 12 vibrations per minute , about the <unk> of a <unk> of a .
so , for example , i have this -- -- -- a few seconds , you would go , , you you &apos;re a a few minutes , and you would leave the room in the .
that all of all recognized . and this is the tune that is to to the the the world in the world .
and i stood there with two very good friends of me , richard <unk> and kevin <unk> .
while we cross miles miles miles miles of <unk> -- <unk> <unk> that could be <unk> .
as i &apos;m here today here and talk to you , i i &apos;ve walked over the <unk> of about five years .
just 10 kilometers miles off the coast and and feet feet .
the ocean is climate and weather , they &apos;re the temperature and and shapes the chemistry of the world .
<unk> is easy to get .
that &apos;s the result , if you don &apos;t know that there &apos;s borders of what we can take the oceans .
for example , the u.s. last three years , the u.s. have been <unk> <unk> miles in a <unk> .
we need <unk> , , new technologies to the ocean .
i wanted a lot of my early career , i wanted to figure out how the wing of the are the the the of to keep themselves in the air .
let &apos;s study this notion of simplicity .
this is a beautiful picture of visual visual <unk> of a mouse from of the lab of jeff <unk> . you can see the beautiful pictures of brains that he showed in his talk .
they <unk> a <unk> to to support some behavior , a other <unk> , another a different <unk> and pattern and and , and you can think that this in a very complicated system .
our mission is to build a <unk> and computer model of human brain .
he &apos;s home and it &apos;s tea .
if you see the surface of the neocortex , you &apos;re <unk> it &apos;s all of little components , and <unk> , like in a computer .
how many of a are are ? where are they ? ?
we can look at the tissue , and we can change neurons .
we can <unk> all these neurons , each single one in their own , , , and see what happens .
<unk> <unk> says that the secrets of the brain can be be be solved , mental illness , memory , , , perception , they &apos;re <unk> out of neurons and electrical signals , and he &apos;s with with a a that &apos;s brain with <unk> synapses .
it would be two or three thousand bombs .
the air force force force it into the smaller models , and started started .
that &apos;s what nasa did to get a <unk> that would fly to mars .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about <unk> behavior .
it &apos;s a fantastic time to write . because there &apos;s so much of that that you can get .
the bottom ? yellow .
when you ask people ask that question , they think that it &apos;s something with culture .
the countries on the right side , those are the very much , a a a form .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of this .
but it back to get it , it &apos;s more complex .
a online <unk> for a dollars .
the general idea here , by the way , is that we really don &apos;t know our <unk> . that well .
in fact , in medical , , this is our view .
and radio waves are limited .
all -- -- can can use to to the eyes of the eyes .
your intensity can be very fast , and it can be turned off very quickly .
they are critical critical .
but the only one .
cars have <unk> and and and and and communicate with each other , and the the lights lights on the the , and so on .
dna is what all it is .
it &apos;s actually not that much of data .
you have the <unk> genome , and the power of that a a of medicine is better than than than that &apos;s today -- she doesn &apos;t work no effects effects .
it &apos;s really just -- just -- only <unk> genes -- but we could fully <unk> it .
we &apos;re not running as a little organisms alone in the world , but are part of a big ecosystem .
the can be bad -- if we &apos;re us or the the earth -- but that &apos;s just the consequence of one of us had done .
now i &apos;m mainly here , because there &apos;s a kind of dig in the the of the , the moment we have a a of people who think that you a dog , first , , , , human rules .
they &apos;re just like <unk> &quot; , &quot; , , and and so they &apos;ll be beaten .
no , we do , , &quot; , sit , &quot; -- boom , he can try it to six to 10 .
they are like golden <unk> .
and i would say , if you don &apos;t need it , you should not be it .
not just the the , , but also with the rest of the family .
these are are so simple .
their kids are just too train .
wk : i want to make a windmill .
so , and that windmill -- does it work ?
wk : yeah . i still think of working with energy .
because although i used scientific scientific , in songs , sometimes it &apos;s sometimes very hard to make it . .
and still still , when it &apos;s accompanied by <unk> and <unk> , , in my case .
one is a white light of light .
64 with with .
let &apos;s see the third question .
the desert <unk> a mile or two one year .
the homo erectus , the the the the the the the .
you can teach them in the lab , a little bit of <unk> , and there are also a <unk> in other animals , but the the of the object is never happening .
it &apos;s is the wealth ; it &apos;s <unk> of their own needs to save time .
we &apos;ve done that as a species .
but there &apos;s no evidence for that .
and when people started started objects objects like this , , this was a evidence that that a a between between groups .
but who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
but that &apos;s i &apos;m also to the the of the people , people , and that never never have a lot of the ideas to get to and and and , and i &apos;m sure that technology is going to and and and so that
this is so high as a <unk> building . i &apos;ve been the the as as as comparison .
but we don &apos;t talk about that , we &apos;re not going to take it seriously .
they &apos;re just way , these feelings , they are gone .
if we think about the <unk> <unk> <unk> , , is the the problem of the problem , how can we discover things that are constantly changing ?
i talked talked to -- -- you know , this situation if you don &apos;t get get it on the hospital ?
what about real people ?
we &apos;re a of of their viruses ; it &apos;s new , , , , , .
after 10 another 10 days , you came back , you -- still even even even even even of -- -- -- little oxygen in their lungs .
it didn &apos;t even thanks very much .
it &apos;s a classic <unk> , but it &apos;s completely new . nobody one has ever seen before .
a &apos;s a a of battery could do that .
we instead , we &apos;re something that is the the the of the .
i brought a <unk> with with smaller density , a <unk> <unk> with high density , and and salt in between .
but david is young and smart and and he wants to build a <unk> , and so he build -- then then the the first metal battery with this chemical composition .
so what did we learn from all this ?
this video was taken in the <unk> , six miles off the coast of <unk> <unk> , about 20 meters of the surface .
and what was really realized that our garage was not big enough to this growing project .
i started to to the <unk> and and their methods and and how they and how important she found that children find things themselves and they &apos;re not taught to be taught , to open .
evolution is often been as a way that we &apos;ve chosen , but it represents a large number of possibilities .
i &apos;m going to pass it up to the stage of space space .
our cities are in risk , many of you are in the coast .
there are also stars and so so .
so if we think about <unk> behavior , or body language , how it &apos;s social social social , then it &apos;s . we think of communication .
that expression , also as as , as , , , <unk> , , , and they showed that people who people and of the blind people , doing this when they &apos;re doing in a <unk> . .
so i thought about it . you &apos;re up with people and you can how they participate . could you get them to and and then you would get more ?
what happens to a <unk> , what happens when you &apos;re on the <unk> stage ? how the this little manipulation , this tiny little bit ?
this is in the lab . the the , the little exercise for just a few minutes . where can you really apply that ? that was of course .
these things like that . people are like to to . you show themselves . .
she was completely <unk> and said said , &quot; i have nothing to look at . &quot;
they need your body , privacy and two minutes , and it can affect the other way of the in the .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to get their <unk> and <unk> <unk> , an ant , , and , their brain , and put a up a grass of a a .
and you have to have a kind of <unk> , you have have an answer .
so it &apos;s like i think richard and i important to me that these ideas aren &apos;t being . .
and of course , they are gone extinct .
but under all those ideas that are to to to our technology around the world , are lots of toxic ideas .
and as we should , we should not try to get it to . .
and in my game , that &apos;s called <unk> .
we were some ideas on legs , we went up international tour .
i know you &apos;ll say , &quot; t isn &apos;t in the music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
nobody sounds one one . no one another .
you &apos;ll see the orchestra in a kind of <unk> <unk> .
i don &apos;t want to to that that should have to , but we we to be better if it &apos;s to answer questions that you you to consider if you think about the follow
they &apos;re in <unk> . they &apos;re in the driver .
five dollars a life can save life .
she &apos;s about two dollars a day , just a a <unk> , and he explains that you &apos;re not married kids , before these things are done .
finally , , , , they went and and a old woman .
it &apos;s not even new .
and as you &apos;re , if you &apos;re angry , you &apos;re going to talk the best speech you ever &apos;re being regret .
okay , the great majority of us .
his message was also , the , of the of of of everything and the of of everything , and its value value was respect , was kindness to strangers .
who &apos;s with as he &apos;s going ?
they have start to in israel and palestine , in jordan , in turkey , in syria .
and so more and more and more <unk> , and for recently , they have a income for their family .
just go to somebody with another culture , another , from another country , with another <unk> , , , a different different , , and it &apos;s to to to a conversation ; listen
i start to where where the story started , in in in in .
now morning before you <unk> , who who of you have the to take a to take a
you see see here -- 35 percent of these fewer famous houses where 50,000 people people people people people people live living , 35 percent of the houses had a
21 percent of what we &apos;re fix are are of of <unk> , things that actually actually started into into .
we did it . he got <unk> .
we found later that in this region is the the of of diseases and death .
one thing is in the context of everything we did , , , &quot; nelson mandela said nelson mandela , too far of here , &quot; how slavery and <unk> is not <unk> . it &apos;s not the . it &apos;s the work of people
it doesn &apos;t really me , if you call me a <unk> . . really .
it sounds really <unk> that that it &apos;s up from here , but if you &apos;re trying to use it , it &apos;s really effective .
and this this statement i i to them to you that kids don &apos;t leave their their to to live in better .
this is the recent <unk> <unk> <unk> in in america with our <unk> of the bronx .
this is a picture of the bronx that the the kids in his house , not in jail , so they felt <unk> .
we gave a little back .
if you have big kids with little little , , , , the big , thick , in the middle , which is cool , and they create this responsibility under <unk> , which is incredible .
now you might wonder about those kids .
hold kids from from the stores .
stephen zander : a teacher that the south bronx <unk>
second , i bet that even you &apos;re here as a <unk> of here , here &apos;s a increase in the the of the , right after this <unk> line .
and 10 : <unk> , the pig has a attack attack .
people with a , , an aura , a has a with with neurons -- here in red , that is going to to five five five five five five five five five five five five five
the problem is that 30 million americans have <unk> , , and we need a <unk> . . i think we have now .
my first wish is that the <unk> <unk> for for epilepsy , the <unk> , for <unk> <unk> -- -- a <unk> -- -- for the treatment of the treatment .
lawyers were taking cases cases in the of of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> the poor patients with of pity .
and a year ago , four of four years ago , four of the <unk> of , which is called <unk> , &quot; <unk> , , also <unk> .
how do you know what what what important ?
so i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about death . &quot;
i put it the first time to get it here .
and people &apos;s the the the barrier , i &apos;m going to be <unk> , because they &apos;re going to get out of the process of the to share with the world .
they have to use them as a platform as a platform to develop their <unk> and and <unk> , in the around the world , the teach the the science .
yes , books , maybe maybe 100 or 1,000 spending in year .
it doesn &apos;t surprised to like all , , right ?
how do we protect it for the future ?
so that &apos;s not very hard .
the days of the <unk> are over , when people say , &quot; so we &apos;d like to have three three or <unk> of them in our country to see how it works . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not a <unk> . it &apos;s a <unk> . .
you can get a few thousand kids with two <unk> .
so it &apos;s something like an electronic book .
everybody says this is a 100 $ <unk> , you can &apos;t do .
and that &apos;s the <unk> . .
you click on things around and and on the . &quot;
he says , &quot; no , no , no . there &apos;s a better way . &quot;
we &apos;re all playing , &quot; i &apos;m poor &quot; in a big line of , , of information and we can &apos;t keep up with it .
thank you .
i think most people think that who who who who who who who have a child who also have their child .
that &apos;s not possible . that &apos;s not .
it &apos;s going to be all . . they &apos;ll live .
one , to prevent the <unk> .
two years ago , one of the mothers mothers came to me and told me a story .
how do you build a better healthcare system ?
the <unk> is is how simple the system is .
if you look at the volume of gray substance in the age of four to 22 years , you take them in childhood , which is the chart . it &apos;s in the early youth .
the idea that her father in the public , was enough to be .
this is the <unk> that we &apos;ve together together .
after the first year , it was invited from the <unk> <unk> museum museum in austria to install it in his lobby , and i &apos;m happy to say that there stayed there , 24 hours a day , for almost nine years .
but night , as we <unk> , , i asked the <unk> , like the <unk> decided they were to to to .
and here &apos;s the result .
a place where my family since the family has been working on the <unk> .
honestly , i have no idea what it was <unk> , but they &apos;re incredibly <unk> .
the first thing you realize the <unk> , is the terrible force force of the <unk> .
he &apos;s it around my leg , <unk> me up me me me me me me a car and can make me a a a .
it was a <unk> in the ground .
and she said , &quot; well , it &apos;s about it . &quot;
we &apos;ve that 200 years , the end of our direct <unk> of our direct <unk> with the world .
it &apos;s so easy to see technology as a metaphor for memory , but our brains are not perfect <unk> like technology .
it &apos;s the <unk> of my <unk> .
i would like to think -- thank you .
and i can assure you : corn is in in anything .
you should know that in every community the the are already growing its <unk> .
i run three <unk> of antarctica . antarctica .
but what , tell me where they &apos;re and and what land are . . &quot;
we also also also the the surface of the islands -- a very important <unk> of for birds , one of the most important <unk> in the pacific .
and we &apos;re as the rest of the world , a problem .
he actually actually the term &quot; reverse <unk> . &quot;
and of course , the <unk> and the open sea , the open sea , but the <unk> that that everybody would like to look at trouble .
here is the pacific , with huge <unk> and huge <unk> .
now there &apos;s <unk> , immediate , , , <unk> free free for of many of our devices , even the your . .
it &apos;s an endless debate , and there &apos;s no idea , not a , not a , but if you &apos;re a big big as i are , they say , &quot; well , what do you tell us the
instead , he was very carefully documented , which is what happens when technology is the first time in a environment and and in a community .
so there are , of course , two different possibilities .
this is an blue field -- it &apos;s actually an yves <unk> .
i mean , that was at least , it was me .
now , there was a question of course , a a while i &apos;m in head in the head : you , i can do more of things that i like to do in design , and less of those that i don &apos;t like to do ?
and here it &apos;s it from the front .
you &apos;re a terrible situation of the way .
they &apos;re going to be in hospitals hospitals .
as a <unk> , for example , i was looked as a <unk> <unk> in <unk> , because i knew the <unk> <unk> , and i know how i have to use <unk> , and i can work on the <unk> .
i &apos;ve seen this value of older people as many of my friends who were in in in the &apos; 60s , &apos; 70s , &apos; 70s and the 90s are still active than <unk> , farmers , <unk> and doctors .
as a christian , a a , and made of <unk> <unk> , young jewish men in the u.s. and canada and and , and who also go back to the bible .
the case of <unk> , the last muslim <unk> europe europe
the most bad bad bad bad , , , don &apos;t want these rocks are <unk> . so , and so he &apos;s to stop it to stop .
and one of my favorites is <unk> from yemen .
&quot; and when comes out ? &quot;
<unk> : there must be something that we can do .
&#91; &quot; the 99 &quot; &#93; . thank you .
it &apos;s dangerous when a group group of being an very .
<unk> <unk> : from islam &apos;s called
let &apos;s take a look at .
let me highlight it for you .
let me show you this this .
and when i started to the , i i found something curious about myself .
so , you have the eye , and then the concepts are .
but of course , china has a massive population .
but what what what it shows is that this kind of data is a form of information .
it &apos;s even a pleasure to you , because they &apos;re visual .
the <unk> is after the eden project in the u.k.
why does it smells like as as as or <unk> ? so there are two theories .
and a theory a a to to less less .
now , after some of the , , i &apos;ve discovered that there &apos;s a kind of molecule that you called <unk> , , and that &apos;s the same thing .
this is the basis of the device that that these two people made of ford .
they made it ... and it &apos;s just like coumarin .
that was a good thing .
at the time , a series of things in the that i want to to you .
and she did not have any idea of the context that it ended up .
norman !
i said to goodbye , neither my mom , not my father , not my sister , my my , my , , my my , my my , my my .
i made of it . i &apos;m doing it to say that i had two things i i i i was the the the i wanted to do , and i was one to find my family and and the other was to write poems .
and this is how we look for them .
and then you hope that one of us is around and and and and and .
he had a <unk> , and he has to be <unk> of other , and and most of small family family , , to be to his age 12 12 years .
is it a good evolutionary adaptation or will it lead to the the way that we can be the the of the on the planet earth ?
but are we going to do that or will we going to take the to the
one day , a few weeks , or maybe a year later , i was my my my my my my my <unk> in a store for <unk> . i wanted to buy a <unk> .
this meant a fundamental shift for me .
my hint : about 70 layers of this , <unk> <unk> .
do you know how to understand how thought i really , ? this project is just me , and i was so far , i i went to to a a newspaper from san francisco to buy the the bird .
when we put the path to the spectacular blue mountains in the west west , was a perfect <unk> , , , , the smell of <unk> and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you ever run again , just with a <unk> . . &quot;
i remember that my father was me on the wheelchair , and i was down down to the bottom , and felt the the sun in my face .
they said , &quot; we &apos;ll going to go next to them , we think that it &apos;s good for you . &quot;
she was me the the <unk> , and i called the school school , i said , i &apos;d like to want to a a book .
and i said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and mom and dad ? never top .
i &apos;m in this world , but i put it in .
it &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by an richard richard .
how to the hell , i do a phone in three weeks , when i have these things about millions of years ?
each of these elements , you could look on the wall as a kind of <unk> .
in the days , he was the highest head in british .
i look at the single <unk> and how they flow -- how they move and flow , and it &apos;s based on furniture , but it &apos;s not the <unk> . it &apos;s made from of , it &apos;s made of ritual , as unlike the character and it
that &apos;s the car the future . it &apos;s a <unk> . .
if you think it , another another , , it feels totally completely .
this is my studio . it &apos;s the prison .
it was made made of . .
now , after i i i was i was fortunate to be a member of a <unk> , who used him for the first time to study the sea .
there was one of these <unk> . .
it uses a red bioluminescence like a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> of to the the bottom of the light , and can see you can see without seen .
so they use it to and and find and find partners .
i urge you to to another science that which used still used hundreds of years of old technology .
this is a magical place .
so i was on the value of the <unk> .
and on june june , i heard a the seat in the , which was my life changed and a duck .
and here are the <unk> .
after the price changes my life .
another example of the impact of the of the of the life of birds .
so , for example , i like this , this is the sound of purple .
the ever after i i can , i can hear music music and and .
one is &quot; i have a have a <unk> &quot; by martin luther king , and the other is of hitler .
right now , you can see more more that that former <unk> are now are the .
you don &apos;t want to say , that that could be used to . &quot;
absolutely critical .
what happens when teachers want to make order ?
and why not ? you don &apos;t trust the law . why don &apos;t you trust the law ?
because it &apos;s an <unk> structure has a .
because life is complex . and here is the hardest and and the biggest change : we need to to the authority of the and and of the law and and .
a a society needs red and green lights , otherwise you &apos;ll be a a of a .
the limits for the interest to calculate the <unk> , and the the the you can take .
well , if you think about it , it &apos;s really difficult to get a <unk> of a a .
he had a very paid job .
he he had a <unk> .
but the problem to leave on rules and incentives , it &apos;s that they the the the the , and and they <unk> the the the activity in two two .
so so smart <unk> are better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine that any wise <unk> can be this for for for time .
why does this be spread this idea ?
people want to be <unk> .
it was a extraordinary time . i &apos;m going to be the the of that we we &apos;re -- america and the rest of the world -- then .
this was <unk> , the the .
we have to do it with a complete <unk> . .
what i want to show you is what they needed to to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
what would have been if if they had nuclear weapons ?
we &apos;re down and get the truck that you just saw , somewhere here .
part of the problem is that the <unk> itself is , from the idea of a nuclear disaster .
it was sent from someone who &apos;s a <unk> of the <unk> , the fact that it &apos;s hard .
there are many black sheep out there that the wrong things have done .
we can show our results . we can do better things better .
how can we put them into it ?
it &apos;s <unk> to have a dangerous environment environment .
imagine we could , we could , because if we could do it , we could get more .
the governments that most of the progress are the governments to have the , the that have found to to value , to the business of , instead of the the the the the the the the
maybe i can go here here , i can see the brain , and i can change my cut .
i &apos;d like to zoom in .
come up with me the 19th century , , , right to june june june .
we could certainly be so productive , facebook , facebook or twitter , not us much time .
they &apos;re looking at <unk> on the british government , to get money for the <unk> of <unk> machines , because they believed that these machines would be tremendous practical impact for society .
these , , these these are not not just less wealthy men the research , but they also to to look at the <unk> , instead of the other questions .
i &apos;m going to tell you how i learned something about life .
once you start looking at the little things -- this person wrote a entire article and said , &quot; hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
and all of the aren &apos;t old enough , they have no idea how that infection happened -- which is this .
there are about 10,000 percent of . .
this would be the frequency that you &apos;re going to the the of of the of the <unk> of the in one of by the , , the world .
anywhere wherever life is , you &apos;re going to have the distribution , contrast to this distribution .
too hot , too hot .
the officer says , &quot; are you sure ? hey , , you you you &apos;ve lost the here ? &quot;
these are the data from one survey in a single survey in in in zambia , a few years ago , i &apos;ve been <unk> .
as you can see , bruce , , he had much more hair back back back time .
you could speak from 10,000 , 20,000 or 30,000 dollars , if i had time time , i had the time , i i i was in my plan , and i was
instead than teach people how to put the paper into the phones , we should be able to create software that allows you to do that without without and and without without my
that &apos;s less than i when i i to two two weeks ago .
and then we understand that if we want to change our our , in life , or the balloon , we need to change the height .
that can be in the spirituality .
and that &apos;s why you need <unk> .
i promised me that i &apos;d going the next time i would fly to the world , not be a of to be , of fossil , to be safe to be sure not be threatened by the <unk> .
i think you need a pilot in the plane to talk to the universities , who can talk to students politicians in the the , , and it can really be a human adventure .
and what is the goal ?
that &apos;s why all of people people who believe in these human , , to be part of this team .
now you only need a laptop .
anyway , for us , africa was a a place place .
the next thing i &apos;m about to think clarity is what &apos;s this problem , and what it &apos;s not .
this is crazy , really , when you think about it .
let &apos;s stop that a a second .
in fact , we &apos;re the first generation of the disease and and very extreme poverty in the eyes , you see the the ocean , say it and you .
it &apos;s going on on the nerves .
this year , a a of of us , specifically for the leaders of the states that are started and the history .
people people find that out .
and with this one as our screen , , my organization , data , data , and other groups are the energy and the the the the the the of hollywood to the from from hollywood to america .
step for step to step forward , a nurse , a teacher , a a , a <unk> , and saved saved .
the idea that the internet , the the of lives , changing a country -- and a continent that it just made to to to to , let let let me get the head .
lips are not lips , it &apos;s volcanoes .
and your job is to see what this shapes is is and which is one .
now , if you &apos;re not <unk> , , this sentence , literally , wrong .
if we can solve a problem or something new , , we compare that , we already know what is unknown to us .
nadia <unk> : i &apos;m glad to be here .
they don &apos;t fit to all of those those .
pm : i don &apos;t think so .
how are they to it , , they personally , but also with their <unk> ?
some of my reporters been arrested arrested .
so , it &apos;s quite a another picture from yemen .
my heart was a half a long .
this is a list of side side , if you eat too much salt as a <unk> and <unk> sandwich , and then they &apos;re going to the in the
but i i i was what i was symptoms , and i had to go back to <unk> , knowing that i probably never see my home back .
i was sitting there and i was a little little excited with the <unk> and and i asked him what i would , i would do , i could do to do .
i was on a dozen machines that was me to life .
thank you .
interestingly , one of these <unk> cells also have in in the u.s. u.s.
and also , interesting that the same companies that us the 80 million pounds of atrazine , the <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; -- the the the to the the and the the same company .
we also launched as a <unk> .
what would our kids children children say , when when you &apos;re a day day , i had a little bit of <unk> , some artificial <unk> , and a little bit of
the problem is that in my village , oakland , in most of our villages don &apos;t see this connection .
this is the the of the <unk> <unk> next to the airport airport los angeles .
i offered five cents for every <unk> .
the <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> , it &apos;s become global .
here you see , in red , the the of the .
they &apos;re looking like a mouse that look the foot of a elephant , and the largest part of you you them .
it &apos;s from from your <unk> and <unk> from all directions around us .
and , a a a a that is <unk> in the sky because they tend to something that &apos;s called <unk> -- repetition .
<unk> <unk> the the of stability , just like a cathedral and help to live longer .
it &apos;s absolutely <unk> to see that .
but recently , have have the doors to be open and open the walls .
that was 25 years ago .
let &apos;s look for for example , the the <unk> .
how do these people do with these infected computers ?
and you can afford to see how we work working -- -- and we &apos;re trying to find a way to find a way to the the that we meet .
you &apos;ll find that you can see there a <unk> , , <unk> / <unk> , and if you open this image image on your computer , it &apos;s going to and and and .
and if you look at the pictures of the scene , you can see that the the of the the .
we need to make any way to find that all again , the computers were . .
but i have nothing to do that .
this person showed up with his . .
why should we believe what he he says ? &quot;
what does your future look like ?
these powers completely , no one <unk> the 2011 .
it would be good if if people were <unk> , and and this kind of calculations seriously and participate in it , this would change things . but it would change things on two more different ways .
that means that we can see a copy of a copy , if they have a part of the <unk> of of <unk> , slow up and and and and and <unk> .
and the happy couple , jill and kevin ? well , they came back from her <unk> and saw that video of a sudden , a a <unk> .
thank you .
you &apos;re going to go to go .
that &apos;s what it taught to him since he was five years old .
i &apos;m grateful for the fact that i had an mentor like would me me how to <unk> .
what is it that you life life ? not a 10 years ago .
what are you doing with what you do , and what happened ?
didn &apos;t have the -- time . didn &apos;t have the -- technology . you know , i didn &apos;t have the the managers . didn &apos;t ... ...
in this moment , conscious or <unk> . in the moment you &apos;re <unk> to focus on something , you can can a meaning of and whatever it means , it does , it &apos;s . .
you &apos;ve ever done , and they went , &quot; i was me ! &quot;
so to go bored . so god in its infinite wisdom , gave us another other to the other .
but that &apos;s true : we need it . we can do it through intimacy , through , through , through prayers , through in nature .
and there are seven different beliefs . i can &apos;t go through it , because i &apos;m through , and the final element is feeling .
jewish man in in in the <unk> , someone in new york who had died , if he had been working on the day , and this man who wanted to be a , and it was clearly .
instead , i &apos;m interested in these tools that can tell you a large number of people can tell stories about the world .
the color of the particles is the the of of -- happy , positive , , , <unk> colors .
we see , &quot; i feel like i was the the first day .
and when i go over here , the the list , and there &apos;s thousands of feelings that are collected .
the 10 themes from and circle the time time .
it &apos;s called &quot; the of of modern mythology . &quot;
we can click on that , and see this this this , of and of of ford , as she &apos;s the the of her man &apos;s
you can see see , , if you want to read to to to to a .
so , people are clouds as something that is in the ways .
in , . she got tens tens tens of thousands of members today in almost 100 countries around the earth .
you just need one step out to go out , and to that that so so so so so that &apos;s so <unk> that all else is missing .
so look up , , <unk> the &quot; <unk> beauty , and think of the to to the the in the clouds .
they were the 25,000 images that did that like this : &quot; <unk> , good , good .
and you know , 10 years ago , it was about 10 years ago when i got the <unk> to buy my first <unk> , it was a huge machine
these pictures from a virtual buttons .
you can see the knife is being &apos;ve in the heart .
it &apos;s a little , mechanical pen , which in its inside , very fast <unk> .
now , this is really interesting project .
so he &apos;s doing it .
so , very very very very .
i went to the children as many as possible to the the academic stuff to the the world .
it &apos;s not yet , it &apos;s it &apos;s an incredibly <unk> of of everything we know about the basics of nature .
i &apos;m not going to go into the detail , why we imagine the universe , but it makes it out of mathematics and try to explain the physics that we know .
but i was my career , my career , , and i always me .
in 2001 , i went to a a <unk> .
we got a lot of <unk> .
this is the the the the the the day in 2004 .
he &apos;s just a a of the , and , and was recently when he was to to .
every is a <unk> <unk> , , , but in different scientific disciplines .
i &apos;ve got my first computer as a teenager , and and it was a really great device .
he also also using using using , , and he says this is the most beautiful brain that he ever &apos;ve ever . .
so the next few slides i &apos;m going to explain you you this .
transistors are more smaller to allow this and and that has much more our technology .
our <unk> is here is this lens here .
i had an feeling feeling that we do it wrong .
so in this sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so , we know what &apos;s a radius radius .
i like to call them the <unk> of the <unk> , because they &apos;re kind of <unk> .
we can see so in our galaxy as than than than else .
and that brings us a factor of 20 .
so there was a bunch of alternatives to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy , because you could make a lot of stuff there .
it &apos;s a much more than than the other and the cloud is <unk> apart .
and i hope that i i &apos;ve you , at least that we &apos;re a a really supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy .
i was a time in the streets of new york york , and i saw some kids of the <unk> , cars and and play baseball .
so for example , people liked the 11th century , the the .
in the first eight centuries of this tradition , the the big &quot; what &apos;s going to to god god and
through new and various instruments , the age of the <unk> .
but one is , what happens when the music goes ?
michael <unk> thomas : music and feelings over time time .
so we we are at the beginning of a new <unk> .
until 1945 , they brought it up 100,000 year .
so i &apos;m going to talk about <unk> , although i don &apos;t know where to start .
wow , a volunteers , great great !
but recently , my interest was been looking at a new view of a new view of a , because there are something something something really cool .
well , i think this is the <unk> of of a phenomenon that we call &quot; &quot; innovation .
but the is the the really most important thing .
we get to get to talk about you .
let me imagine this point sam <unk> .
but even when you put the screen , , you &apos;re more more more than only words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share their knowledge and their data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s happening right now .
how <unk> &apos;s to to the world .
one : i have to start as a i to to the the audience and i i i to to say , instead of say , instead of say , what i can &apos;t offer .
and it &apos;s fun of fun to design their own , ultimate ultimate , or worst design .
well , you can &apos;t compare them to each other .
they &apos;re out in life and give them the sugar , such a of of <unk> we call it .
this kind of tests do this , , ok ?
somebody asked , &quot; why ? &quot;
the thought he could reverse the waves . he couldn &apos;t .
i think there are three big changes , and in the most transparency , choice and choices and <unk> where people have a real power .
how do we do that ?
my favorite , , <unk> , , , , around the world , the world of their head of their head of each other .
11 of 14 countries .
and secondly , teachers were teachers teachers were the <unk> and and as as a <unk> , which they took to specific areas where a a <unk> of sense .
so then i wish of all of a , i got a nice weekend .
dna to read and writing , is always and and cheaper .
<unk> work alone .
now you might ask yourself , &quot; what would i do in a a ? ? &quot;
if you have the world world , , , can lead to a a <unk> that allows to to to .
the kingdom , his laws allow him , strangers <unk> or <unk> , which have an economic risk or a risk or a risk of health care of the state .
these laws are a <unk> to the face of science and and and and and and and a of traditions and a <unk> .
why are you pregnant when you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one of of the <unk> people people who are drugs .
so that social social that are eating condoms out of endangered , , , by the police , are <unk> , or them .
here were born , people died there .
so , to have a <unk> .
they have up the high high , the the street , the the the river below the road , and you get from one end to the other , without the the .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in tiny homes . &quot;
and they should be shared .
her liver makes <unk> oil oil .
and they killed to the over 12,000 sharks at the time , by actually just a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> in <unk> bay .
we know very little about them .
so this this is a a of a a of a a of on on time and the , , the and and the and and .
let &apos;s look at the <unk> of , what what what what to to the genes that the parents , we see that basking sharks , to the first study , the the of the than than than other .
so , &apos;s the research , and and found that the size is the . .
and what was okay . we were <unk> . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build . &quot;
so if we can see the gender gender of the shark before we can take a sample , we can say that geneticists if it was a a one one .
so i decided to give myself the the .
their body will be broken with <unk> and and and to be used for any <unk> of , to make money money -- people tell people stories . stories .
no business doing no . .
my journalism may be other continents or other countries , in my part of africa , but in my part of africa , it &apos;s . it &apos;s about corruption , people immediately , , &quot; where are the evidence ?
aa thank you .
i was raised in downtown in the early 1980s , two blocks away from the <unk> of the <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t be as a <unk> . .
and people have had had a victim of their <unk> ?
today , you can be in in 29 in , more than half of the country , because of its sexuality <unk> .
eventually , i that my my mission &quot; to photograph to photograph , because there was a million different of of gay .
at least , i hope that it &apos;s to to their human rights .
one : the world is , and it &apos;s going to be good and evil because good and evil , and and yang are the <unk> .
and third , i have access to all 1,000 pictures that had had soldiers .
in three ways : the representation of the is called .
this is stanley moog , a jewish boy from the bronx , and he asked , &quot; could the have , &quot; the &quot; , &quot; and now ? &quot;
&quot; my sir , who &apos;s responsible when it happened ? &quot;
stanley lessig , and i <unk> both back in the school , , the james <unk> in the bronx .
here are the the with the symbols of power and anonymity .
<unk> of the other . the self .
alexander <unk> says that the border is between good and evil by the heart of every person .
and i took the experiment the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what everyone could do , &quot; not a big thing to jump on the tracks .
it &apos;s a puzzle that really really really very difficult .
we have a self .
but on my left retina , the &apos;s a <unk> , which is the by the red arrow .
there &apos;s only one <unk> , , the body .
i promise that i i tell anything , except it &apos;s to to be . .
and the the self has extended memory , think think imagination creativity and language .
thank you . thank you for the -- -- and <unk> hill .
now i &apos;m going to tell you this -- i tell it and and to me me me to me me , because i think he was part of the problem , admit , the , and and and fun .
we don &apos;t want a a .
you &apos;ve got now , i i didn &apos;t put myself in fire .
she talked about <unk> , she she started <unk> , she she &apos;s <unk> , , they <unk> friends -- all these daily actions of care and creativity .
i mean that it &apos;s this <unk> that that the homo sapiens of than it &apos;s different .
in fact , this is a sensor for uruguay who read the electrical activity in my brain , while i &apos;m this talk .
we &apos;re many prototypes prototypes and products , which you can control with thoughts , like <unk> , , or a <unk> chair .
the headset is wireless with an ipad or smartphone .
how these kids can use your new consciousness , a lot of the and and the of the and and the social and other people who are being diagnosed with other , to see .
she understood the power of human narrative and the value that we &apos;re in humans , changes , and and and .
and said , &quot; how do you going to be ? ? &quot;
my skill and my opportunities .
now , , , , , they gave them .
and the was not not to to my my eyes .
i walked a track that i i i know .
and , , slowly , it happened .
i didn &apos;t really believe in my , not really not not not not not not all the <unk> of me all the little <unk> in all of us .
that &apos;s me . my whole me .
what we have is exactly the same thing that same activity , but at one of them feel great , and , and with the other , with just a little change in attitude , they feel awful .
but i think it &apos;s another debate that needs to happen to do the of control of control , which we have about our our .
for <unk> percent of this money would have been install <unk> in the on the could not have the the of the journey , but what the pleasure and the the and the the .
i &apos;m not asking the complete whole of of one one .
sometimes sometimes are very , very long .
i think the the of the world is the world is that the field of economics is to be to to the human psychology .
the average had the the 50 to 50 to 60 percent .
it will be you that they &apos;re not , , , other . .
<unk> !
they &apos;re 20 , 30 years .
but that doesn &apos;t mean that i have a coin with two two on two pages .
it &apos;s not hard to solve this problem .
but that is our we of the visible universe .
thank you .
with , , we have , , very strong effects in children around kids around the world , and now people people people .
it &apos;s a man , rich , successful , that &apos;s to live for life .
hello . my name is dan <unk> . i &apos;m 34 years old .
this is actually the score of <unk> <unk> , which he has completely in in . .
odysseus would have said , &quot; well , we do a a <unk> .
there &apos;s the present the present self .
i &apos;ve got to write five pages on the day , or i had to give up five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible that that is going to work today . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you some of these tools here .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you is , the last last time machine , is something that i made with hal <unk> together , my my my my my my , , bill <unk> .
it &apos;s pretty good that it &apos;s not about people , because if one of the faces smiles , , the other face of <unk> . .
this is one of the reasons that that we &apos;re in western science , math and <unk> , in the first few centuries of the <unk> of of the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
x is the unknown , because there &apos;s no <unk> . .
so , not that you you &apos;re talking to with with a lot of <unk> , you probably probably have stories of <unk> , shame and discrimination in almost all life life life .
something more than 30 years ago , the nations of the world in <unk> and and they gave this legendary . .
what is it ?
if you look at the level of species , you &apos;ve heard about the fish .
if you look at these forms , you see that almost 8,000 8,000 from this dollars in reality .
this was in the early <unk> , as india wanted to <unk> to <unk> -- as a means to china , with his <unk> growth of eight , nine , nine , 10 percent , , , , and why can &apos;t we be it ?
this doesn &apos;t get it in a happy , but they have trust the and and the courage , and and say , &quot; we &apos;ve done .
green carbon , so emissions emissions and agriculture and agriculture , and and , , 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
we loved it to win .
i didn &apos;t know what this mean , , dick doesn &apos;t &apos;t -- &apos;t not not not . no sydney heart .
i also liked those intellectual intellectual .
and he said he he had exactly the same relationship to his father .
there was a theory .
he did it in 1968 .
they don &apos;t move , and because they don &apos;t move the the the the of the experiment , you don &apos;t have to worry about how they move .
we removed the whole whole , , and the <unk> color that which simply simple <unk> . .
many of these ideas would in in produced in the .
if you think about about their children to the school , they will come back with <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and .
but let &apos;s play it under their own conditions , and trust them , they &apos;re going to learn about the <unk> of <unk> .
if you want to throw away , and you &apos;re not going to .
i think that &apos;s all . this is <unk> . okay .
so here you see the sick on the left on the left side , and here my wife with go today , four months after , , in , and in good constitution .
how about a <unk> <unk> <unk> , not only the share ?
this is one of the the of the that that were not going to them .
and so it was that in the western western <unk> , to work , to get thousands of thousands , hundreds of millions of , and millions of , , a little sheet that should to get a middle of hell of hell in the sky .
but how does our imagination work ?
but we never think about the hidden connections .
and apparently the the bulb had invented the bulb , it looked like this .
you have to be smart , and even though i have no <unk> , , doesn &apos;t mean that i &apos;m stupid , because you can &apos;t be stupid , and you can get to the world .
they literally actually the the door .
if you &apos;re to the the of your <unk> , , they both their their their .
we have the problem that the antenna <unk> .
again , thank you .
for that reason i &apos;m interested in systems and and <unk> .
recently , i &apos;ve created some very sophisticated <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i drew every person to each other , and wrote her name , and they them them .
i &apos;m sure i can see how you &apos;re . .
and i believe that it &apos;s <unk> , my valuable and and limited life on this earth is right to be .
in this mode , he tried to keep his position .
i thought i i think , i tell a little bit of how nature creates materials .
so , we think about future technologies . we start start in the beginning of the world .
and if you see it <unk> , the amino acids , the the of the they have different charges .
and through a sequence of <unk> , you can one of a billion fish , what you want to do like a battery or a cell cell .
in this case you see <unk> out .
when you ask people the question : where do you go to do you have something important to do ?
i sat on my desk , i got to have an expensive computer .
what happens you &apos;ll happen -- sometimes you have like this , you go to up in the morning morning , or when you get up , or when you get up , and you say , , , , i don &apos;t slept well .
in the office , most of the and and and that people actually stop doing the work , <unk> .
we all know that this is true . you would never have a <unk> meeting that that by employees .
so meetings and managers are the two person in companies in companies , especially in offices .
maybe all two weeks , or every week , week , the week , to to .
you know , to be honest , i do this now seven years and have no idea what the future will look .
but if you ask people the three most important things that they they they , -- no matter which culture culture which is the , and , , , , , , , and if you own one , , the cell phone .
but , , and this is a very big big , we &apos;ve got to forget .
well , i want to give you a practical example of the .
you take 10 or 20 percent or 20 percent , and then the the of of the bed bed , or 20 percent or 20 percent , and there &apos;s a amount of amount in bar in the . .
it calls the norm .
and he has kind of an recognition for the values .
at the same time , with spread of these mobile devices , we see an expectation of availability .
our present reality is less interesting than the history we &apos;re going to tell later .
what are we talking about ?
dean ornish , with us with new research research , which show how the <unk> healthy type of people can influence a genetic level ; he says that if we live living living , , , , and more more , , our brain brain .
until i say , who said it .
within this context , we can also feel regret about many different things .
when i went home to the night after i i my tattoo , i was almost all the night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s one fifth fifth fifth .
i mean , even the stupid &quot; can all the the &quot; <unk> , &quot; to go back for days .
and as i used to say , i i a <unk> .
i thought i would try to put in my ted wish , trying to do what i try to do , and what what what what they &apos;re trying to do .
no india india , and now , at least a million active there .
and i came to to me that somebody in this <unk> world have have to think about the organization of the world organization .
and so we did this to do that .
listen to this : less than four tenth of a percent of who were treated treated , the the of of their drugs or <unk>
it &apos;s worth of trying , and i think it would be successful .
the <unk> are not <unk> .
when the <unk> is used , they will produce 12 watts of electricity , day and night .
and people bring their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , to the green school .
and women , &#91; cooking photos for our food , and they use secrets that are just know their grandmothers .
we need somebody who &apos;s coming and this .

and it &apos;s a to to to a brain to the <unk> .
to get the device to the device , you need a lot of people .
or should you not going to it ?
they said , &quot; you did a a device that has a us on english , so we &apos;ve taught us english to make us english . &quot;
i decided to destroy my own argument by by a a .

now my career could get something more .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
it from the sound of the the the .

rain . not bad . not bad .
and &apos;s a . , but why can i i &apos;t do that if i &apos;m to a piece of music ?
in this <unk> <unk> , the dove <unk> evelyn <unk> , why that hear music much lot of music than less than sound waves on the . .
and it became so big , until the point where there was a <unk> last year , the <unk> <unk> , and rick <unk> <unk> and <unk> , &quot; millions of people on tv .

but maybe it &apos;s different .
listen to focus on the <unk> that you have failed if you have four hours .
in the , , it was always about interact with things , not with people -- not a social social , , of course , would be to to to people to to a to to the same
the monster is very , very evil .
the <unk> was was a <unk> of from our group where they used three three three of three various technologies to interact with the participants .
and with this technology , you can be that in the in life in their grandchildren , in a way that it &apos;s possible today .
and the third possibility was a simple journal with paper paper paper , and , because that &apos;s the <unk> that you &apos;re used to do if you &apos;re a <unk> and and <unk> .
another important idea is this idea of the <unk> of the character .
i &apos;ve style , , , , really hard , because it &apos;s not the , , , , but to be <unk> .
go away , not far . i said , &quot; bang ! &quot; the the is between two <unk> cars .
if he wrote on a <unk> , , i was the door .

85 percent of global global global disease is is the heart disease , not in the west -- and yet 90 percent of the in the west .

autism has a very large range , very very -- -- that child doesn &apos;t have language -- to brilliant scientists and engineers .
i love the film , like you all of my projects , and that &apos;s the <unk> in me .
now , what i learned early because i was not so <unk> , my work is not myself .
another thing is the sensory problems .
in other words , a problem with a a of of a <unk> .
in the film is <unk> <unk> .
i was a <unk> during the the , and i i did , and how how to do it .
another very very idea is to to the kids of the many of the <unk> / &apos; . .

the fifth time i &apos;m standing on this coast , the <unk> , i &apos;m looking out on the far horizon , and i think , again , i &apos;ll going to do it all the way over the , dangerous wild of a ocean .
but it was deeper , how much life is there there ?
and then there &apos;s our <unk> that that you never really saying to me , how far it is , we don &apos;t know how far it is .
but frankly , all of these that i had <unk> , just to to to the the <unk> , they were very different .
thank you very fun for much fun .
and that &apos;s perhaps the <unk> , he lost his sense .
it &apos;s the army . the army gives him a gun .

but there was a programmer who decided that this wasn &apos;t the best way of work .
each of them can do changes , and they can go them to <unk> <unk> , even though they didn &apos;t know anything about each each other .
this is called a &quot; <unk> , &quot; this thing here right .
something that &apos;s a that can happen to a culture is that you can get a new new <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , now . right ?
try not try to improve what other do , a little bit , because that doesn &apos;t get very much .
and when you tell you that you don &apos;t , you can &apos;t hear it .
six to nine months for the year year .
but we &apos;ve made these rover , we we we them there -- or or you have this one -- and made sure that everything works .
so we have to a a space space to mars , , is called phoenix , and this probe will going to be in 17 days , seven hours and 20 seconds , so they can put their . .
and that would be bad .
we &apos;re talking about as we &apos;re talking to the the the that we want to to to to mars .

there were two <unk> of that was very interested in very interested .
it &apos;s sort of like the cycle of the earth , but because it &apos;s so cold , it cannot be water , because water would be frozen .
today i want to talk to about how these these benefits of these these
so we look , as social growing technology is the care health care .
this is an example of this . .
there &apos;s already <unk> wireless . .
and i think many of these technologies will help us to be able to be able to be more with our patients and more time , to the the important to focus on the human elements of medicine that that that through
the the same trend in medicine is become exponentially smaller .
come to genomics , when the first <unk> of the , were the the the cost about a billion dollars .
so , like like like like like like me or the <unk> of of data , or or google health , it will always more more important , all of these possibilities in a way of ways .
we used the cells from the marrow marrow to treat a patient with a heart attack , we &apos;ve made a better <unk> and higher <unk> , , the their of your own <unk> cells after a heart attack .

one day in <unk> <unk> miles in the coast of the the of the the of the pacific , , 20 american <unk> in the sea .
but a a point , , most of the , , , , , and , and they get up .
they have the same structure .
some of us tend to to more more more more other .
right is a amazing gift of the imagination , a kind of <unk> of <unk> in the life , a a way to a view , the future , if time is to affect their look .
nothing happened . no one . . . .
we took them in in the in the world in the world -- international , global , through our english channel .
they were separated from their people , from the mass , and now we see them , one after another .

as a <unk> , , , the thought , the thought , why can &apos;t you take the oldest <unk> of , &quot; the <unk> , and they combine the latest technology ?
well , i think it works because scientists are a community to a community .
it &apos;s significant to show the place in the space , because it &apos;s critical , not in terms of where other things are , but in terms of the that that that that was just god .
and in a universe universe , the only thing that was that it has somehow created itself .
and you understand some things better than others , and so there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> and and and and and the politics .
there &apos;s a tedsters that which was here two years ago , jonathan haidt , who were their work into three different levels .
and just to it everything .
during five months , he <unk> to to experiment with a complete <unk> of . .

or philip glass or or or or <unk> reed , the the brothers that all played there , they all had their own <unk> de logo logo .
after weeks weeks , three weeks , four weeks , five weeks .
a little bit of <unk> .
and it &apos;s a transition that &apos;s exactly as much with the identity of living with the book of the .
but the <unk> and the <unk> of of wealth also also the status of the as the as the , and the the family of the . .
if we could expand our definition of death , to the life , we could experience death as part of our lives , and maybe that death with something else as a fear .

<unk> about this , <unk> about about about about about , and give a percent percent , because there &apos;s very , very few things that can &apos;t be done when we put our entire power .
this is a <unk> . . it &apos;s a very simple computer computer .
can we achieve a kind of <unk> ? ?
now what i &apos;m showing you here is that we can create a <unk> system -- -- the b -- <unk> from a string of components that the extremely simple rules .
that &apos;s three minutes of . .
and when you saw amy smith , she talks about how to get students with with with into into into the .
and it may be that all the the of of reality , is stuff , and , and the the the the the of problems we need to solve .

they want to <unk> .
if you don &apos;t have to be one of the two , , right ?
the developing world used soap and water , water . .
and now i have the <unk> on this axis .
and you remember the the of the last century , it was very bad , to this this what what happens to this called a big jump .

and many of you &apos;ve heard the term &quot; memes . the evolution of technology is something that i &apos;m a lot of attention , so , you know , one of the first objects that had had was a little <unk> .
my argument is basically , that , , , , , , , , already , of our life .
and that &apos;s quite new , and i think that &apos;s even much worse -- -- -- -- -- of in the information technology , in <unk> , in <unk> , which can be used as weapons like it , as or nanotechnology .
i do my best , okay .
&quot; <unk> is our <unk> , &quot; &quot; he has the the people who was a pretty sophisticated <unk> .

so , in the last 10 years and and as hope for the future , we &apos;ve seen the beginning of a science science : a science of what makes life living .
and i think there are three different -- and i call them different different , because it &apos;s different different ways , it &apos;s possible that have one of other -- three different happy .
but it turns out there was no sexual trauma .
you don &apos;t look like <unk> <unk> .
and what you find out is that if you do something fun , the the .

i should be to to what happened with these experiments .
democracy doesn &apos;t need a perfect equality , but it needs citizens which have a common lives .
the u.s. states as the one of in 1900 , in the , where where the line line is too red .
we have got this gift in the 70s 70s and the &apos; 80s , when women were recently .
electricity was also to to the the of women .
an amazing fact , a is that in the first half of the 20th century , the life has has got to the life life is the life is the age of the the the .
this was the article i i was <unk> and and i was a two and i was a two about .
i have some that did a long time : five and 15 and 15 to to be my <unk> and and that led to a sense of failure .
so if i think creativity , i think , is also this sense of the , or the the the the the that i see in the in the life .
that &apos;s what buddhist fishermen say because because they don &apos;t actually have to kill living living .
and you &apos;ll see it more . .
and i had to find what the story .
how are we going to do , what the responsibility and the causes are outside of a dish ?
and you need to be in all the , including including that i &apos;ve never seen before .
i hope you see it , when i &apos;m these these examples , because i i actually talk about everything you could spend their time .

the corners of <unk> , the the the the , , this is the great market .
these guys are the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world .
but you don &apos;t have to be <unk> -- -- you don &apos;t have to be completely <unk> .
so what you have to do is to figure out how it &apos;s interested .
nine months later , i was to messages on tahrir square , reason i saw in my <unk> .
thank you .
mostly , the the cultural legacy would bring up to to the and the the past .
my first one for national geographic , where i realized that you can have the environmental environmental problems in a story of nature , i had to <unk> .
that &apos;s the lions and tiger of the ocean .
and because i love sharks -- i i kind of them -- i wanted to to think , a , rather than a lot of than sharks to talk about the need of of protection for sharks .
after i i i was , i learned that this habitat is is going to create a new new of . .
they also <unk> in <unk> .
but as the fish came back and back and and <unk> and the population , the the , , the the of the water .
she &apos;s now living in the jungle of <unk> <unk> , and this is <unk> , , their second son , the the the the the second of the second , i i saved , <unk> .
it was a biological desert .
then you can see the the and and it starts out to measure what &apos;s out .
so how do we break this cycle ?
and you need bacteria to try and try the nitrogen , and without the <unk> , there will no have any performance .
the humidity is 10 percent higher .
so we can really change climate climate .
in <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> , there &apos;s a democratic culture , so you can use the developed to to protect the own system .

i &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
either it doesn &apos;t exist , or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or anything , but no , in no part of science .
people always always say that consciousness is hard to define .
you can &apos;t even even the in the existence of your consciousness .
it &apos;s a digital computer computer in the brain and and to , , we need to find the right program .
we bring all the the and and and as properties of reality and as qualities of the .
... don &apos;t you find ?
but i also meet people who what they do , love , and they can &apos;t imagine , to do something else .
we don &apos;t teach american history in britain .

i couldn &apos;t get this thing to work , no matter how often i am <unk> .
but we have to change from an industrial model , to a a of the morning , every single school .
so , and i wanted to find more about it .
the reason for this is that the historical report is going to be from .
and she was her light . she said , &quot; okay , so it &apos;s seriously .
she led a group of students in a protest in the streets .
i stood up , a tea , and i sat down , and i &apos;m here , and i &apos;m still , almost , , but there .
so peace , <unk> <unk> them the back .
he wrote a book called &quot; &quot; &apos; the to democracy to democracy <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s not such a <unk> thing .
in fact , chris was worried and said , &quot; look , just show this picture , you you you you &apos;re still to one of these crazy of these , which don &apos;t do much . &quot;
it &apos;s an object for the mind .
and the solution that i <unk> , , the the of the the of the the of the the of the earth , from the the of the biosphere .
so i said , &quot; what would be -- call the -- we call it <unk> , where they <unk> the implications , in the denominator -- we call it <unk> , , where they put the impact ? &quot;
and he was a huge <unk> of the market that has our our and and .
we literally won <unk> . .
but five days later , back in atlanta , i got an email by glenn thomas thomas thomas , a of my people from the meeting in california .
so , , , , , many of us that work in the business that the industry is being threatened by technology and possibly be <unk> .
and truly , do we need somebody to communicate for us , so we we have a experience with an an ?
the arts , whatever you do , you time when they &apos;re us to to to to our with with and curiosity .

the manchester &apos;s a <unk> <unk> after my quarter .
it makes a lot of money through the <unk> of of being special .
we &apos;ve taken the the curriculum of american american <unk> , which is where the <unk> is the harvard of the , and we <unk> a <unk> for mothers in in in this <unk> in in the middle of the inner city .
we &apos;ve realized that you have to to them flowers and sunlight and eat and and and and , and , and you can keep underestimate the spiritual cancer cancer .
these kids who were up over the world , fly from public schools , and that &apos;s what they are , with with with affection and sunlight and and and and and confidence .
and it has all all all the time .
and i &apos;ll allow you to allow the concert , and i &apos;ll give you the music , and should you ever have to to sell them , you have to to to you , you have to to the the that that the money to the school . &quot;

the brown building , you you guys , and i &apos;m telling you where where i did my greatest mistake .
he came to me . he said , &quot; man , that &apos;s an marvelous story .
and so he &apos;s a group of people .
bill <unk> tells a quiet and important story of redemption through art , music and unusual . .
and the the is the the the the the the the the the brain , and the result is a <unk> that produces a normal <unk> . .
but there were the <unk> factor , the problem with the code , and how to make cells better answers to do normal responses , and so that was our contribution .
it cover us with a invisible <unk> , the attacks of the environment so that we &apos;re healthy .
but when the bacteria grow and grow and all in about , to make these molecules , then the goes up the number of molecules outside the cell outside the the .
now we know that all the bacteria can talk each other .
this is just a picture -- a <unk> of your skin .
bacteria are <unk> <unk> , which is to to that we kill antibiotics bacteria .
the fact is that bacteria have a collective behavior and they they they they they could never be able to be able to be if they were just to as individuals .
it &apos;s a great honor to me to go to this conference .
or the first one that come in the room .
but if we think about justice , &quot; aristotle said that what we need to think about is the actual character of the activity and qualities that are worth you you <unk> them , <unk> and and .

so , aristotle aristotle &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , and the <unk> question of marriage marriage <unk> of the marriage . right .
michael sandel : the lost art of the democratic
many people said , &quot; well , you know , <unk> , have not to to rural guys , what we we to to do with our time .
and i think that &apos;s good -- the future humanity is to make a decision .
if that &apos;s what that is that for us ?
i &apos;m going the speed of the <unk> is going going to be .
i &apos;m this <unk> .
we know that there is this threshold because we don &apos;t get <unk> people before we get a <unk> age , and and the the the the the the the of our birth .
that means you have to make their homework to understand if this is true .
audience : hi . i &apos;ve read that in the last 20 years , average half of the average lifespan on the planet around 10 years .
not one of their media has been able to do it .
we don &apos;t care how we make our profit .
they went into the center of <unk> and and put <unk> on the the .
but i can &apos;t have a <unk> , , the <unk> , the the , that i have , , and and and and .
the <unk> is is a little bit scary , and you probably probably know a part of the <unk> .
where americans die a day of asthma , three times of of the &apos; 90s , and almost everything comes from <unk> .
he was obviously sense of humor .
politicians and <unk> were afraid to be <unk> as &quot; <unk> .
second , because we have been out .
so we thought , &quot; let &apos;s try it . &quot;
there you find some amazing animals .
the the government said , &quot; enough -- we &apos;ll go . &quot; and we were paid people to the <unk> that they saw .
he may be thinking , he would have ever born the <unk> baby , so he may need a little of help out of the .
i asked peter , he was done , and he said , &quot; no &quot; &quot; no . &quot;
we want to now with africa : the next chapter , &quot; and this is : a healthy healthy , , , more more .
but most of all , they need to be productive in their lives , and a kind of productive environment in our countries , so things can be done done .
we can we connect this this ?
we were on the side of the . .
i had to go through the legs of these people , my my my my my my my my my back to
you know , we need to use all good well .
and i often don &apos;t see african collaborators under them .
the question is now , how do we use using all of that good will , that &apos;s going to ?
you &apos;re <unk> . &quot;
we have <unk> <unk> in in nigeria with the <unk> .
and with this idea that artistic creativity is a <unk> product , i took this , so we can can can look at them , just as we can look at any different of of
the the has been applied to the 90s for the time to study complex complex processes .
i want to try to do this for you .
and then i am in the room room , there , games in the .
how do you have a rap scientific ?
there &apos;s a massive brain of what &apos;s in in in <unk> .
i want to say , , and statistics , that is the mathematics of games and <unk> .
this is very <unk> and not &apos;s not pleasant .
but it keep the thoughts for the the eight seconds .
in play and virtual worlds , for example , their facial facial facial facial , can be used and intuitive to control a brain or virtual . .
otherwise , they a very fast , and without a a , , is not possible , so , are dying .
another statement of esther was that we respond when it come to a tragedy like haiti , but this is a <unk> . .
it &apos;s creates a <unk> of the and and is a very interesting <unk> substance .
we have every road , every street , every every , , every every square of . .
in your <unk> , , a very cheaper blue laser .
audience : yes !
now , , even though we have the the time , we &apos;ve never done , we &apos;ve never done the the the the in the air .
this is the restaurant <unk> house .
this <unk> that you see see here , actually in in a <unk> , which is the outside of the , and it &apos;s <unk> .
so , water is a important aspect .
metal &quot; and &quot; earth . &quot;
the idea is not the .
they don &apos;t even enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal here .
once it touched the water , you should hear how air comes out .
and once we sequenced these two genomes , we we asked : if this is the smallest genome of a to a a species , , could it be a there be a smaller genome
and , we we that we , once that worked , a real chance , if we could get the synthetic chromosomes into the , it it &apos;s the bacteria .
care is a <unk> .
the last end , the is a quote by robert feynman : &quot; what i can &apos;t can &apos;t , , i can &apos;t understand . &quot;
but in fact , we live in in the northwest , in the actual notion of the , of paradise , 36 time , as , , <unk> by by spider .
but the more you add , the more to get lost .
and that number , 72 are never . .
this is a nest of a wheels colony , and this is the nest entrance .
this is a colony that had been founded by a queen in the previous summer .
the <unk> -- -- that &apos;s a a glass glass -- is a interesting group . they go early in the morning , before the first group of the .
well , , enough , it looks like about half the only just it does nothing .
the nest maintenance workers just take take all the <unk> and and put them into the <unk> edge of the and and and put it there .
the the , , , , not get get out .
and we &apos;ve been experiments that that the longer the longer it out , it , the the the the the the simple <unk> on your surface , so that &apos;s the ants that they can different different .
they &apos;re the the entire earth , the of antarctica .
here you see , the cost of of all the world in the world are about about million barrels of oil , and the annual cost of three trillion dollars .

some have 5,000 . many have more .
there was <unk> <unk> . and there were <unk> .
<unk> life is an event . it &apos;s <unk> it .
these are working on <unk> manhattan manhattan , where you built to the first <unk> .
this was in a six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want that thing to be the light light .
a friend of mine told me that story : that they didn &apos;t just to and , but then they had to be the <unk> than they were , when they were there , , they had to call someone .
so i &apos;m going to use a more more clinical language , and you &apos;re not going to be as warm as as as as other other talking about compassion .
and here &apos;s the basic idea that <unk> to good for people who are going to be .
basically , it &apos;s about when you &apos;re my enemy or my <unk> , , if you &apos;re not my friend or my family , i &apos;m a lot less less less to use the golden rule . okay .
like that , the results are up . this is a game game .
each form of <unk> <unk> , , forces , the the humanity humanity .
and you you you , the other think that america don &apos;t get it , and they they even lose them , and they hate america .

openness is not the end .
now , the dominant <unk> would say that there is a single <unk> in a single cell cell and that they make a <unk> .
what does that mean ?
we found a kind of <unk> material that made the right matrix matrix , we we the cells inside and lo and lo , and , and , and the right , and you , you , what we we in a culture culture .
and of course , we now we now now now going to go ?
and so i want to finish with a poem .
we &apos;ve got a a journalist who was caught on the <unk> , , a young <unk> , , a a of <unk> , , that that &apos;s a of the shop , a <unk> <unk> in new york times .
it sounds like a a a a book , but it &apos;s actually about new new of lie .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about itself . surprise .
you &apos;d have four little friends of a person who are their personality .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can look at data ; they were talked talked , and then were .

im : do you worry ? you &apos;re so cute .
so , i &apos;m not saying that it &apos;s good , but only it &apos;s not , , ok ?
if you have the <unk> to long , , it &apos;s it . .
i call it the era of the -- what people are different different of different or or or or or or or , but as citizens can be the same .

the second is the the that we have that it &apos;s so so difficult to make to of of of systems in companies that 93 percent of the indian of of jobs in the .
so , if you &apos;re a young country , you get a chance to make a modern <unk> , so that you don &apos;t have the <unk> when you get older .
you have to have a clear , of what &apos;s important for india and important for the world .

and so the countries of the bottom billion a very <unk> policy .
a few economists came just in time and and said , &quot; why don &apos;t you try a ? ? it &apos;s going to to . &quot;
in that moment , in the world , a billion people in poor or or countries , , how can we help them ? the economist paul paul paul says , a a , , that we can get the gap between arm

this gives you a a <unk> in in africa , this <unk> that that to the the <unk> .
so what we did here : imagine , imagine , they thought of a lecture and and could talk to people in their language .
&quot; basics of surgery .
14 years ago , i was the the that that <unk> , <unk> , that been used in the in the same way .
he says , i was asking that as a <unk> piece of the city .
so we were with little <unk> <unk> to create a water dry fog that will shaped by wind , and when it turns out that it can can can can can can can can can can be shaped with it without without <unk>
they were in their <unk> in the grass , the <unk> , the <unk> of the the who they didn &apos;t know , and shared the <unk> of miracle .
and that i that i that that that that is incredible risk for our society .
when peter is his arm , this yellow spot you you see the the the the the activity that <unk> in <unk> .
if you do this , what will you going to control ?
and to say that these of change can be , , is a a a a a a a , of course , or might be true .
now let me make me clear what i don &apos;t say , i &apos;m not saying science can find this space , or that we can have scientific to to the <unk> of the <unk> .
now , why would this be an objective morality ?
what is the the chance that this is a summit of human development ?
on the left side , you see <unk> <unk> .
we live in a world of <unk> technologies and and technologies can &apos;t be <unk> , it &apos;s always more easier to break things than they were together .
but then we have to talk to about well-being in a larger context .
and what is the natural enemy of what the means of the of the of the good beetle , which we talk ?
it &apos;s a parasite , no <unk> , a <unk> , , , , , , , , , , a quick and <unk> .
and if we put this good <unk> of , for example , in a <unk> , , you go to the flowers .
in israel for example , where we &apos;re on on over 1,000 acres -- which is 10,000 60 israeli <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , , 75 percent of the pesticides .
third , to increase the consciousness of the potential of the potential .
<unk> is one of my favorite <unk> .
it &apos;s even more fun to make the the of the the , as than about <unk> . . i do that .
&quot; urban <unk> -- that &apos;s what the new yorker needs .
her <unk> name was <unk> <unk> , and so that -- i was not <unk> enough to say &quot; take the drawing . &quot;
or the the the was only only some few decades , maybe within a decade , after the the soviet union was most powerful .
because there &apos;s 80 percent there out there that really insects eat insects .
they &apos;re at the beginning of the . .
why do we actually do this balls in the soup , it &apos;s it anyway , there were meat ?
it &apos;s 25 pounds per person per year .
so , we &apos;re going to decide to one , or to five pounds of
we can increase it a a of of , , but there &apos;s be an a to a .
and you might think , well they &apos;re not available available . .
my three minutes still haven &apos;t started , right ?
he said , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; &quot; , we have to put it on the table .
and i &apos;ve seen a sign .
even when even the the system , they &apos;re doing it in a way that society is to to society .
and in this book , the little lewis would find the great idea .
this is a <unk> , , and on the back there are some other people , , , and scales to make some calculations . okay ?
right . so , this is used used .
there &apos;s a quality of of and and and just amazing and remarkable .
so , the first robot i want to talk about is is . .
it &apos;s only used to show that if you have cameras cameras or or other sensors because it &apos;s high , it &apos;s up 80 80 to be <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
for example , in this case , although the left and the right wheel is connected to a only axis , and so quickly turn fast .
welcome to <unk> , the robot mechanics of the <unk> of . .
but the cool thing about it is the .
let &apos;s see how it makes . . this was our first attempt to get , , ... ... ...
but what is the secret of our success ?
but just by a of imagination , is not enough .
in this way , education .
<unk> that to be <unk> .
there are no pool of the <unk> teachers , and only eight percent of the county have have about a <unk> or a a .
there &apos;s a complete blank on the creative capital of bertie county .
the goal of the game is to have all the the on the the , then the team has been . .
but in the last few decades , but a lot of money that for for , , , , very way .
and then , out and the neighbors about what , for food and and why , is a homework .
in this , it &apos;s impossible impossible to create big <unk> of space .
i &apos;d like to invite to to follow my journey of the and and .
after four months , season , it and and and now , eight months before before before .
here &apos;s a few results .
this global act is in the same climate change , climate change , , , maybe even more than that .
when i learned about these two things , it &apos;s very , for , for , for for , for a scientific reasons .
it has a very very <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is in the in the <unk> mcdonald foundation .
after the treatment , we &apos;re going to make a a of a a of of a a of of simple <unk> to see how bodies can take .
the answer is movement , and i want to show you the next video .
i had to discuss my wife . long .
we &apos;re going to <unk> these <unk> and and we have to get more results .
and then , i i from this <unk> of from from from from , and , and i thought , oh i don &apos;t know , but before i i about , i &apos;m looking at it , i &apos;m like that .
but this was the the the 95 and then the winter , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , it &apos;s been to the the <unk> &apos; , and she &apos;s excited excited . their family my family -- it &apos;s a big thing .
i was trying to do that i could , against who , against who , , who are i here ?
i always ever won everything , and now i thought , what ?
you can be <unk> . . take it . . &quot;
it : aimee and the designers will be two and ted <unk> two and we &apos;re going to talk about design .
they were got someone who came over and the shoes .
but it &apos;s almost impossible to see the actual losses of economy , it , because we use <unk> .
or in the over the . .
and another thing about mathematics : mathematics looks like math -- like in this example , and sometimes it not -- -- how &quot; am i drunk ? &quot;
in math math , we use about 80 percent of the to teach people , how to get three three hand .
when people ask me : is that right ?
but the where allows you to separate these things , so that &apos;s today , something else today , a a car , and learning and learning of the .
completely wrong .
but i think we can do here at the same time .
and one of the reasons why it &apos;s so important -- so , it &apos;s very important , computers in the .
it was winter 2009 , and i &apos;ve been blind for about a year year .
i thought particularly thought about my father who was taken a a of of a surgery a surgery .
similarly , just through the <unk> of the that can change change change change change change in the land , and with the time , you you have a idea of where you &apos;re and you &apos;re .
but then when i was <unk> and and went down , and i was been been in the corner .
if you design a city in the blind , there will be many , many jobs .
and to give you a sense of this experience , the article called &quot; i think you . &quot;
and the <unk> of the famous that i knew -- the ten commandments , love love , be , and <unk> , you ...
you give money money for a good purpose and and and for the of the .
it &apos;s not a book that was written and and from the sky .
so , one of the key to me is to be the key to to remember that that on the way , &apos;t <unk> the car , and i &apos;m &apos;t get up on the path on the .
that was very inspiring to me .
so if we want to give this book , meaning , we have to get to to it , and with it .
so we have this wonderful progress .
the academics that the this work thought that was to be , so we &apos;ve developed <unk> applications like this <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of a <unk> on a <unk> .
alex working on a little , , independent <unk> called <unk> report &quot; <unk> report &quot; steven <unk> , and invited us to develop the interface interface to the movie .
we &apos;re these <unk> surgery , because we like to <unk> and <unk> on green <unk> .
let &apos;s pull it apart : i bring it in <unk> .
we , as people , those are those things design and we should make sure that our machines are helping us and build it .
john , thank you for the to to reality .
what okolloh did would not be possible without digital technology .
but here &apos;s the point . the <unk> creative act is still a creative act .
but the institutions that that that that black line , said , &quot; we change this deal .
they &apos;re created by the members of the community for each other .
and like all the good <unk> , you have a jump off 20 years , when it &apos;s the audience .
you don &apos;t always have five days to the , and so we started to play <unk> .
but india didn &apos;t want to play the the <unk> .
the other was <unk> cricket .
was this new india ? it was a different world where you could get to the , long as long as long than you were the best players for the best .
we &apos;ve seen seen games in calcutta , but we &apos;ve never seen seen , <unk> was the the audience with a <unk> song -- for a , , not for india , but for india .
could you imagine that that day would ?
hopefully i have to of them to a experience of and and the game , and hopefully , and hope is a long time to work in this business .
and you know that the most <unk> dogs is because because they &apos;re very quickly in memory , how often they saw dogs and pigs at the . .
why should anyone in the world ? ?
on the other hand , if you go a a developing country and and for 25 dollars , a <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> for a big mac .
would you spend 20 dollars dollars for a ticket ?
i &apos;ll give you an example .
and if the way to the the of the city of 100 mice is worth 100 mice value , it doesn &apos;t matter what they &apos;re saving , but people don &apos;t think that .
well , large , and you &apos;re enormous thin .
watch what happens when we <unk> <unk> .
dan , i would like to hear more . you say that our answer is to the terrorism , i mean that is a kind of mental mistake ?
there &apos;s no <unk> .
and so some people people are being being as as stupid .
and and variation is one of these <unk> that requires a certain intellectual activity , because you always requires the variation with the subject that you have in sense .
&quot; &quot; in words , and in fashion , the the same rule of beautiful when it was not the first one , the first new , &quot; the the the the the the the the . &quot;
and i woke up one day and i said , &quot; well , maybe it &apos;s not that ? &quot;
first , my call me to a a critical audience , i i i was to be sure .
it &apos;s my intention to go with the poster , , , you should not have it yet .
so , in the and and all the way that they &apos;re doing .
jews often have a <unk> smell smell .
if the room , , we could see that people have more more negative attitudes to the men .
it &apos;s as i &apos;m to talk about about what i did in the in the .
it &apos;s my mind and my soul .
they &apos;re shit .
there &apos;s a young director , hollywood director , with his friends , other <unk> , and they talk about what is film .
without food , i got sick .
we don &apos;t need a problems that he &apos;s out the .
our government was corrupt .
so for me , the idea is that we have all these kids , it &apos;s a generation , we have a whole generation of children that had to go so much psychological illusions or damage to africa . africa .
and through the whole book through the the book , more than an hour of <unk> and and interactive animations .
what what &apos;s the business ?
it had at least the seem that you you , , , actually could be actually <unk> .
so i thought , &quot; yes , that &apos;s a good idea . &quot;
and still talk about it .
when i came from college , i worked in southern southern southern and , and you <unk> on the the on the the and and the and and stuff .
rsw : what is his <unk> ?
the <unk> -- -- they got me to with and and have their <unk> <unk> to bilbao .
that &apos;s this me .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; well , what can i do for you , mr. gehry ? &quot;
if you were three months months , three three , the ideas are always more more and more and more .
and one thing that i wanted to mention in my favorite , , but somehow , it was to thank all of the companies that i helped to the on the
but in the meantime , these things are happening .
and this is 10 weeks later , by hand .
you see the stones , the <unk> .
the <unk> of <unk> and and things is remarkable , and this is the to be the . .
it &apos;s an incredible <unk> , 15,000 workers , i think , five five and the the , and the the .
on this work at the <unk> .
50 percent of the computer in the world are in in in .
it was quite unusual , so stefan , that less less than five percent of the advertising had a picture of the main theme .
and wish is three : <unk> . i i to to make myself , and i wanted to have a <unk> .
and it &apos;s going more important more important that we can figure out how to make these resources from these complex complex complex . .
the traditional ways to separate material , not simply doesn &apos;t work for <unk> .
the traditional way to create <unk> , , using oil or <unk> .
at the end of this process , we have a <unk> <unk> : many different types of <unk> and many different different qualities of plastic .
now i see a lot of <unk> out there .
and what we see is that people tend to make mistakes in the same way , again and again .
maybe we should study how how to make the , to make the , and and find out if they make the same <unk> of the same way we do .
here &apos;s a . it &apos;s going to share a <unk> for food and wait happy , and you get their food .
she &apos;s something that that is opens up the market .
imagine imagine that i put each one from them 1,000 dollars in the hand -- 10 hundred dollars a hundred dollars .
you can either choose a <unk> loss -- so i throw a coin . head , you &apos;re really going to lose a lot .
if we made in our little little of of these , , , would you do the same things like people ?
the person on the left is a safer loss .
maybe it &apos;s not just the people on the last stage of development that make stupid mistakes .
and that &apos;s the catch .
but when we think about relationship with physical , , the most are the four stories up .
we need to go less with concrete and steel , and we have to build higher , in the last time we &apos;ve worked on <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s much , as we &apos;d have in a billion six six to the streets .
<unk> <unk> <unk> my window .
maybe even citizens , &quot; , &quot; , , they &apos;re up up to fight the <unk> of of the , and the citizens work together to help each other .
<unk> , the largest and oldest bank in russia , mostly in the government government , now <unk> to , employees and citizens in the development of innovations .
we &apos;ve about talks about the people who have have their plants with their , and and <unk> working on all over the world world , to to make the the of the and and and videos .
and so i i started thinking that the eternal mother always always says , &quot; are all the kids there ? &quot;
that &apos;s compassion .
he asked them to convey a message , and they read read in their own language , a central <unk> , which was a version of the golden rule , &quot; what you don &apos;t want you to do to do not do any other . . &quot;
to be a pastor called to to each other needs .
and we do this by some of the . .
there are across 180 messages in washington d.c.

i saw my aunt , when i was only five .

santa claus knows whether you were or not , right ? &quot;

they looked at each other and and , in the sense , that was the right answer . then they were going to &quot; do you believe that all the brothers and sisters on earth ? &quot;
perhaps their greater ability to cooperate and adapt ?
i think that film shows the first of the modern times , &quot; the road . &quot;
in world war , we had to make a lot of stuff .
but we can &apos;t forget that it needs a to a a , and that &apos;s how many resources of the planet we use .
but now , good news !
it may be in latin america .
and at this point , the and and the the of climate change in change .
we did a project a a project a a years ago , a a big program , it was : the <unk> -- -- many many , many people -- many of -- -- -- everything -- -- -- -- -- -- a <unk> <unk> .
a group of them you to spend it for yourself and the other group is to to to other people .
when they walked from the first building , , all of a man who , on a man who <unk> and and and and , and the the , and the the question is : did they did this .
the word is &quot; <unk> , &quot; a combination of &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
there &apos;s a wonderful book called &#91; : &#93; stuff : the hidden life <unk> .

and i found this in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my , my , my . .
i was between <unk> and <unk> and and i to to to my my <unk> .
well , it was essentially frustration frustration .
that &apos;s how it was . .
he has put together , to this , and and , and then he came into this software , i think that that they actually his his son , and he has made this wonderful presentation .
in those documents , there are little <unk> , little boxes .
i want to suggest -- yes , make a beautiful website , how how i say , you don &apos;t should make a beautiful website ?
now you &apos;re asking the linked data that you have put together , right now , 32 hits , which each one of them is a protein with these properties and you can look at them .
and that &apos;s what data is on linked data .
all of this is going to have two million children , two million children , last year , year 2000 2000 .
and if it &apos;s , we &apos;re ready to collect feedback feedback , to make sure that the promise are really ?
you just just one of the numbers there that -- is that the number ?
my brothers started to draw and draw and paint .
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m fascinated with this this field .
how many of you have a cow on the street , the the on the to to ?
it &apos;s just that we are trained as people to perceive reality , and that makes the meaning .
and they said , &quot; well right .
can &apos;t &apos;t you do anything , you are artists ? &quot;
this is a box from <unk> .
because if we see someone , , you see the footprint .
what percentage of the have the foreign <unk> ?
obviously he sat over the last 20,000 years in a cave .
so the <unk> is actually really to to to get here , because -- if you think about it , i &apos;ve been to to think today , the economists that most things are very <unk> .
this is the place i showed you in the beginning .
we &apos;re now going to be a bit technical .
think about toyota .
they can &apos;t get it on , , so they accept it and and find it a way to work with it .
it &apos;s very difficult to voices .
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> .
pizza get you in the .
there are millions of different <unk> .
so remember , when we think about sexual education and activities , they &apos;re out in baseball .

in over , societies , people have <unk> the <unk> of of this <unk> . .
they came home with <unk> percent of the <unk> home .
and it became really really too powerful force .
and i say , &quot; why do you think that men are <unk> than women ? &quot;

others , it &apos;s too much <unk> .
peter <unk> : what if our views were about diabetes ?
my great , , henry ford , believed that it was the mission of ford motor company company , life life to improve people &apos;s life and make cars for for any affordable affordable .
and the good news is that we &apos;re now the the big problems of cars and environment -- not just ford , but in of of of .
i think you can can be .
but what really inspired me is the ways that we we have to start when our cars start communicate with each other .
we need an infrastructure that is able to support these flexible future .
this is a minute of
i think think , my mother , i was a kind of <unk> . .
the nurses have to data data data .
that &apos;s really important . it &apos;s a . &quot;
so what what what &apos;s happening ?
it was great for us , because we won a lot of prices .
i was infected when i was 17 , then , a student student student , i started adults adults who thought really my ideas ideas , <unk> and and many <unk> <unk> with me .
so now it &apos;s all about the children . so we don &apos;t . .
so basically , we gave the a simple task .
for our we , we have some wonderful pictures for them for a really good purpose , they &apos;re to to buy about hearing .
but i i i i i i i i want to do , is that is cool cool .
in in a way in the elegant , , <unk> , which is that we have <unk> <unk> , , the <unk> , which is another kind of development -- inspired by the incredible kind of <unk> experience .
if you think about the change in our society , the the of the country that took 200 years to the years , the same process in 20 years .
it &apos;s changing , even though they were still not .
so , for example , we would put the models under a artificial sky .
i think it &apos;s an reduction in 94 percent for almost .
and how we do in this growing world , a little bit of , , in some places that i talk to -- -- -- -- for example , in the next 10 years , 400 new .
and this is the focus of the <unk> talk -- there are no lighting in the positive sense that is healthy and and well-being ; no no darkness .
in , for the first office i showed you to the beginning of the talk , this is a very such an office office , that the <unk> . .
behind you you you the the building building , which was later to a icon of modern <unk> .
i think what you &apos;re looking at here -- what -- much of light in the sky , and never &apos;t . the ground .
this is not very pleasant and <unk> .
they &apos;re not going
when our <unk> , like a few weeks before , a war in a third of india , about 200 <unk> , , he &apos;s the the .
and one day -- i don &apos;t know what happened -- while i went back from the office , i i saw a <unk> , or i was in the mind , i could be like a <unk> , , would be wonderful .
ag : but what is it being used ? what was it used ?
what to do ? to break rocks .
this is the only place where they could express their creativity .
they don &apos;t want to be a second choice of standards and <unk> .
and that &apos;s what <unk> <unk> <unk> made .
i had to my my favorite .
mr. <unk> , who lives with a physical , , , a a inches .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> .
this is <unk> .
these are <unk> billion people .
or <unk> . it &apos;s just fun and and people love it and do things and do things .
so we &apos;ve been very , very hard , but we knew that it didn &apos;t be so hard to develop the technology of what the great about what &apos;s important and how technology can be used .
cars are not to work on next to park ; ; it &apos;s wonderful <unk> to to to between between cities and go back , but think about it , we have all the problems in terms of range and speed .
so if we could have this box here , we could have a solution to transportation , electricity , electricity , and communication , and perhaps drinking water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 kilograms of
and or , , that that the people people die , somehow in the drug drug , we take it to the the way that they were have been been being tortured or they were both both both .
there are the the of a a of a , of <unk> and <unk> and the the press the the , and that &apos;s true to the .
mexico and the u.s. , is is a truly international organization , the partnerships with production production in the south and global in the global distribution .
but part of them , a month month of being a magazine -- you live in the future , and we have a long time .
and after you falls under a critical price , it it it it , if you &apos;re successful , a critical mass of a , a breakthrough .
but they &apos;re very very , very cheap , and look at the interesting impact , and if you &apos;re cheaper cheaper , lose the brands , the <unk> and and , , the <unk> , the <unk> , they win .
if you look here , linux is in red , it &apos;s has 20 percent .
&quot; open open is really , , you know , the gift of the silicon in the the world .
for some of the technologies we &apos;ve talked about .
patient capital works in in between , and it tried to take the any of the .
the second thing to be been very cheap .
president obama understand that .
because one of the poorest farmers in the world had found access to a technology that has it to change life life .
and yet , this is exactly the properties , men and women were honored to be through all generations .
you remember , during the <unk> , <unk> in his blog , in the <unk> and <unk> it , and it was only possible because they &apos;re easy to use .
i like music , and i like <unk> , and i i i i talking steve martin , and i said , i can .
i wrote this post , and i got that , and i was now .
and you can see this post .
these little things .
and maybe i have to <unk> , because i i i i &apos;m talking about it .
he has been been sustainable , , except for our generation .
we need to use this new to to make a better understanding of the way .
we &apos;ve been these these of , , but it &apos;s only to learn how to have them .
but it &apos;s only half the size of the the the the the that we &apos;ve ever have .
they come together . that could be sex under a . , and there it &apos;s .
you can <unk> a lure -- it &apos;s a a seal -- and a white shark will going to go to , a <unk> creature that comes to our <unk> .
and then we can even the animals , they &apos;re a a , by us .
and the white shark .

all of the few i i i on my life .
when i started to the project , people said , &quot; why would you want to say all what you do and where are you ?

i want to start with a paradox .
and here you see it in the relationship of inequality , which i showed you you i i &apos;ve come back to back .
first with the rich , developed countries , and then in a second <unk> of , with the american american states -- with the same question : : cut the more more more on all of scales ?
with the impact of what the <unk> of of the of the .
and in our analysis of american states , we find find the same . .
the social <unk> of and and the fear of this <unk> .
or for for example , why is is the more violence in more more more more is because people are sensitive to become <unk> .
a year , more than three million <unk> a a new knee or a <unk> .
you remember , like kamal did the the .
if you you take it under a or a rock , or a sari , it &apos;s very clear that they wear a prosthetic , and in societies , using disability with a social stigma , people are very sensitive .
so thank you .

this is the results one to the , , &quot; google just as many &quot; o &quot; , as there are pages .
strong fear gets .
but if you &apos;re in this condition , the never never done done , , because you would suddenly say , in the , , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve got a new way to do it . &quot;
almost all we do , , .
it &apos;s about to be safe in this world .
would the park park would be and , and , , then they would never go to go .
it &apos;s a very small thing , you should not be the results .
i &apos;m going to talk about kids and and and a series of experiments that could could look like an alternative of .

this is our first patient , just out out of the , and now look at this chair !
these are the <unk> of my <unk> , or our our .
i have to serve . &quot;
this is in the in parliament .
they put them on a very special <unk> diet and they treated with big care .
his app was only <unk> when he won the <unk> price .
but there were a lot of about about about how to be mr. about this problem .
so we have the situation in the world today where there is more and more countries the relationship between the citizens and the government is to the internet , which is being being by largely private service .
rebecca <unk> : let &apos;s get the the internet !
they won &apos;t usually all four years of the <unk> in the <unk> and in the in the the in the olympics , they were the great <unk> of communism . with a a a a a a that was with
the european union that started to the the of of globalization , and the the the the the richest <unk> in history with the of history .
from 1994 , , for seven years , , 20 of these boats <unk> <unk> <unk> , italy , every single night .
let me go to the <unk> of the crime .
i &apos;d like to be to to be with .
they affect our <unk> .
i mean , if i &apos;m a good <unk> , i i have to believe there is a reason for that .
this was very <unk> it . they didn &apos;t want to start back to the beginning .
it has been waited for 1960 , as a <unk> , , a <unk> , said , &quot; i think our ancestors lived in the for for for time . &quot;
but the absolute connection works , but it &apos;s just in one direction .
and then the fact that we &apos;re <unk> .
like professor <unk> . he &apos;s understood it .
so if it come and if it &apos;s going to , who , what does it do ?
one : i want to like like like this way .
yes , i was a with a couple of <unk> .
you see , somehow , in the life , and i feel so much of inspiration in the of the .
this is called &quot; atheist . &quot;
online online -- you &apos;ve already seen a lot .
<unk> and <unk> &apos;s frank frank is a very <unk> <unk> and tells us what it depends with passion : people help with with little , <unk> <unk> and interact interact .
the answer is quite odd .
so , four four four : you say , &quot; if you &apos;re going to have the information , i offer my help . &quot;
and every time i talk about what i i i i i i &apos;m going to do at at least why the body is meaning .
so this particular instrument is called the <unk> . .
they &apos;re and and and and and and some some of the time .
that would not be a big problem , because if we were in <unk> , we would learn our their , , to help everything that would need to find and find a way , they <unk> .
this is data from the <unk> of congress , you show the <unk> direct direct book of what would happen if the current circumstances and trends continue continue .
the rock is holy , and when people circle around together , they they , they can trust each other , they &apos;re going to be one .
so the the <unk> and the <unk> know , the the side of the other side .
for many reasons , the after the world war ii , a a male <unk> .
there we are as as land .
we &apos;re going to be a nation with two classes .
this is really a social disaster , and the liberal are very concerned about it .
but they don &apos;t exist yet . so i have to make it .
they &apos;ve been in in in the architecture .
you see looking at these <unk> that the protocell actually actually away from the light away and the dark the dark .
i &apos;ve done , i i i to to , for three three decades of hospitals . i i most of .
instead , i &apos;m a <unk> professor professor , , psychology and <unk> at at usc gould school of law , i have a lot of good friends and a little husband , and i want to be here today .
i quote from my records : &quot; i had my my my my my and and and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , where where we were working on a homework homework .
and then put up arms arms and legs and legs at the bed .
i &apos;ve never met a <unk> that that that that that
i could go them and and and we could make it very <unk> . &apos; , ha ha ha .
the american prisons are full of people who are hard to , and many of them are there because they never got a reasonable therapy .
so we &apos;ve to stanford , so we decided to build another <unk> car car .
that &apos;s four billion hours that will be in in this country .
in short , there there were a lot of water and not very many people .
the montana montana montana have already done a lot to reduce their water water , but they still use millions of of water water .
he &apos;s paid paid to make water in the stream .
i don &apos;t like to do a problem , without the the that that work on the solution , so i want to point here shows shows the &quot; mad &quot; and movies like &quot; &quot; <unk> and and and and and and and and and .
his name is <unk> .
i know there are other other other other companies with compassion , but google is the environment that i know , because i i &apos;m doing to google in a case .
so , it turns out that google is a with compassion , because , is that compassion is fun .
and you come in the morning , and have three colleagues that decide to build a hospital in india .
there are three steps .
and i hope that compassion is also for for for it and profit .
but one day , the perfect case . it was a <unk> that was sitting front of your house .
i met with one of the <unk> , which was the training of <unk> and <unk> , which is the normal tendency is in contrast to the . .
people often tell me , &quot; you know , this is wonderful , but it &apos;s highly <unk> .
in the same <unk> that you &apos;re sometimes , when you &apos;re in the york york and reading , and <unk> and a light .
different parts of the world have a <unk> for different things .
and at the same time , the beautiful piece of <unk> <unk> , who made these beautiful <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
but the objects of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the kind of water , , it was really a wide .
even the chair that open open up and then then you put your your , , and so so this beautiful series of objects that are looking at for <unk> .
what &apos;s it ? ?
instead , they developed a very interesting approach to my education -- which is that they they &apos;d to to to school they could &apos;t afford .
my last story , and i have to get a a .
and he died , when the was was on to to the the hospital .
in your is a way to do that .
and just the jump .
and we africans need to start to really care about our leaders politicians .
my my could &apos;t afford the school school , and it &apos;s very smart .
and if you don &apos;t take you , then you think that &apos;s not .
so the country years years of the and and religion .
this is how our political problems .
<unk> and future leaders became shaped .
he helped in in in a birth .
it &apos;s the heart of medical care .
i &apos;m just going to sell this just at every clinic in the world .
now , when i got this , i was -- press the -- -- me , me , do you understand
well , in a few weeks , <unk> will be a big girl .
and as you can see , the life expectancy is a short .
the expectancy has been up on <unk>
that &apos;s the most best technology for this region : <unk> .
let &apos;s start with water water .
but you have to share this with the world .
the <unk> y seems to <unk> .
100 people together to an nonviolent march , an idiot or a <unk> , a a , guess who are over there &apos;s a there . this one guy .
and it &apos;s about humor humor . humor is such a strong force that can turn the game , and he also played a very big role in the .
now , the <unk> : how is it going to go to the arab world ?
and she said , &quot; i saw your talk in live .
i said , &quot; if 500 to 500 or 2,000 , , my life is over . &quot;
there &apos;s nothing <unk> than that .
and i see them .
and everybody broke out of applause and said &quot; yes ! &quot;
i know your father never was in <unk> , he was in .
the other thing you have to know about shame is absolutely organized by the gender .
i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
we want to be with them and them .
and if we go up and go up and <unk> ...
if i was an ant in the rice , i could &apos;t see that .
this helped us to make a very ethical and very very very organization organization , and a system that they them .
we have a simple digital digital digital digital digital digital digital , and make a a <unk> a a a a a a a a .
our our our our , , up to us a a a a a a a , and we &apos;re going to treat a lot of people .
that &apos;s a hard task .
for example , we can <unk> digital content with physical mass .
wouldn &apos;t that be a way to make cell cancer ?
it was when you couldn &apos;t see me as i was invisible .
and another one ever had ever heard a <unk> , or seen this new ways that that is the creation of the , , , and , , , because now you have this concept in your head .
as as a is , , the hole , at least , , but not without a huge price .
don &apos;t feel that .
and it &apos;s also the story of modern capitalism , because it was the wealth of this country , the our <unk> system system , a system system , which has no <unk> and and and and the of the .
the oil is not one .
now you may have more and more and like this .
great show . man , that was good !
bf : ... how it left .
dh : all right , please please please please . ...
rw : can i keep him ?
dh : does it just <unk> , say it ?
dh : then go .
dh : the french judge ...
dh : i &apos;m it -- -- to get the <unk> down down down with my <unk> .
bf : from six seven seven . dh : this is the world record . bf : right ? dh : for us .
he &apos;s fewer known as the two because he had this idea , to build mechanical <unk> , never built one .
but if yes , you you can see something that &apos;s very , very similar .
this is from a paper that they <unk> .
there are plans .
you know the problem that we don &apos;t want to believe what we know .
we don &apos;t want to believe what we know .
second of and juliet , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and diana , army and <unk> , and that &apos;s love .
now , i &apos;m sitting in the wheelchair , i i put more in in the wheelchair in the wheelchair of it .
and we &apos;ve got our children as we have , we have , , we have a species species of other species . us .
but it &apos;s not a normal film .
but if i i actually , a a at every right of this screen with the resolution of <unk> with the , , , we would need 3,000 encyclopedia to take a look at the genome .
what does this mean for medicine ?
and so he he the the of of their children .
it was there there &apos;s a to to to to eat .
imagine , in in , the the only <unk> , not only the four years of <unk> , , but also your personal genome .
and so i &apos;m going to you all of them , and and and to the the revolution revolution that they &apos;re going to .
and we have a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> a particular <unk> , , within the part of the and and the the the the the the .
hopefully it will to to to that technology to see more of the survivors of the .
on the branch , the the sample of the , they <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
so &apos;s so exciting . it can generate the the of of the , , so we will going to be some new new new .
the most common charge is the electric .
they say us what changes of changes .
but that &apos;s what the theories .
many of the think of the most beautiful structure in the mathematics .
the only way to your mental health , in the in the in the the of of the uncertainty , and to get to the , is to to the balance and and a perspective .
the patterns of points i showed you , actually actually actually this this <unk> of <unk> that that , , and it &apos;s the and and the the . .
and we &apos;ve heard about the story , from from the from the from the .
in the we find a lot of many , many examples of compassion , for for love and real altruism .
most importantly , i think , is to work with small groups of women , to give them the possibility of the .
and you know what i mean . i &apos;m about pollution .
take the <unk> of all the problems that we have the the planet , in the the environment and the the and it &apos;s a message of hope .
and <unk> <unk> and similar things , what young people are better to people from their teenagers .
this change change change change . change change is to to to to the future is we worry about the future .
in the plastic , , , about the , , , , of the first eight years , started to into some of my pieces and break into smaller <unk> .
recycling . everybody &apos;s about about about about about about about about about the idea of recycling .
so i &apos;m here , and i and our recent recent and much successful successful trial , the in the in the in the
the author of book is juan , our <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s actually <unk> on amazon .
at that time , we knew that was a political thing .
at 15 years i lost a kid , a second when i was 16 .
i know what it means to suffer , and when a crime , should be each each and and . .
but what if that didn &apos;t be ?
and after a few <unk> , prototypes , i thought i thought , i was here , the the <unk> .
that &apos;s . . please .
okay . the <unk> is used by thousands of people .
or we could use one of these . .
mao <unk> <unk> , they used them as the european civil civil , and that &apos;s probably a more amazing description .
my my opinion , ladies and gentlemen , is that this is probably not possible to be more .
they &apos;re starting to see the <unk> of a world world .
but this is no longer the case .
the <unk> of nations , well , we had always had .
but one last thing .
but if you ask the <unk> , , what the the the formula is a long life , he could probably not tell you this .
it reminds me of my college .
and the research shows that that these years , , , , , , , by chronic disease disease , brain disease , and diabetes .
you have what we want .
currently we &apos;re at half .
and for a while , we looked at the <unk> <unk> , , where there is actually a high percentage of <unk> .
instead , talk about the next trip to nature , , , , and yes , they pray .
it &apos;s us up on nine nine .
they tend to feed to feed .
for the little example that i think in the hand , we &apos;ve used a <unk> that &apos;s to my skin by this little light light light .
so so often , amateurs , no experts , the inventor and <unk> of things like mountain mountain <unk> , <unk> , , , , -- -- -- -- -- -- ...
then , the was the great shapes of the , the only been interested in , and nobody of them have to have one of them .
you only have the own eyes to get through .
i mean that he was seen .
we we have the the the the and <unk> .
and i said , i can &apos;t get them , but i can get it into the zero , zero .
we had four <unk> and and two nurses in the airplane .
and actually , you can have some pictures , because i &apos;m not going to see me on the screen .
no life life , from the living all of us , to us , , without these these these these .
i <unk> on <unk> . i i went to eat .
i didn &apos;t change my iq wasn &apos;t gone .
i was a writer .
so , no nobody would be family planning if your child doesn &apos;t survive .
and then we decided to why not use the religion , because on the philippines , the catholic church was right strong , and <unk> are the .
we did in our first <unk> , , and the women who said said , &quot; we only want to to do the family planning planning .
you can call it the coca-cola , , you like . it &apos;s the same thing .
and then aids in all schools schools started in the university .
and then here , the american flag , &quot; don &apos;t go home . &quot;
these are things that are been been .
can you imagine , at every starbucks , they can get condoms condoms ?
it can &apos;t be scary or scary .
so i &apos;m going to a picture .
you can simulate this behavior of behavior in the browser , what romo is doing here on left .
i want to tell you about my four minutes of the <unk> .
people like all of them here in this room .
she went elegant , like a a a african african , , the flag on your shoulder . i wrote -- -- -- on the <unk> , , the flag , so my my head disappeared .
i &apos;ve worked on my my life women and women women .
and is the only solution to to the the bad teeth .
it brings the women to plants and <unk> , and , drop in drop of drop .
women and children , especially the poor , are the bottom .
if you sell too early , you &apos;re going to get the profit , but if you &apos;re for for a long time , you &apos;re all the to the the .
you can see the the , but you can see .
the challenge for the <unk> player , whether it thinks that others is fair , or that it &apos;s too little , that he thinks that only one or two dollars .
now i &apos;m going to some of some of .
we can try it . maybe we &apos;ll be .
so what do we learned today ?
about 10 calories , needs to be a food food that we consume in the west .
as &apos;s a city of the city ?
and in the city in the east , in <unk> , , you &apos;re offered for sale . it &apos;s why it &apos;s called <unk> .
and at this point , our relationship changes completely both and the the cities .
the word of everything was used thomas moore .
<unk> <unk> of the . .
we need to understand that the world also also is what we eat .
it &apos;s the source of of all morality , this <unk> act act of the , to the place of another .
and i see that that a <unk> of intelligence , not just a a <unk> feeling .
in the <unk> , we have -- -- two and two and half a half a million , a million , , a , new new new new new new new new new and exciting technologies technologies from steel , concrete , glass .
the next project is , and and the the passive nature or to to to make <unk> <unk> .
so you can put a chain chain of elements .
when i was in <unk> , , , i gave a public talk a a group of students students . middle school .
we &apos;re looking for <unk> of of like for for for flu .
there &apos;s unknown unknown everywhere around us , and it &apos;s just for to be discovered .
so , could we go off the lights , so we can see it ?
so we are chemical <unk> that are different . our kind of chemical <unk> has . .
but i have to say -- and i &apos;m going to , , , richard -- i never never liked to <unk> , , , and i think we &apos;ve got to a a of a hundred million years .
everybody &apos;s talking about about about , , a reduction in the to to .
he realized that it &apos;s possible to make different laws that allow the to to to to to to to have to to to to .
both both are dark in comparison to puerto <unk> , which is half a lot of people people as haiti or the the .
to one of these <unk> , hong kong is is . .
people can come to to the the the the , but nobody is forced to be .
and lots of those of the have understood that people can can work on rules .
how would we write such a ? ?
you thought in genomics , a little more than 10 years , you have been that year , the end of this year , and you have been , and it &apos;s it &apos;s already .
if there &apos;s a lot of , , they &apos;re a lot of green light .
the number of common genes extended a little bit , we had a <unk> parasite , and it was even bigger when we focused on certain <unk> of genes , about about <unk> .
it were to to a high genome after a radiation , by his chromosomes into small pieces of 12 hours of 24 hours .
let me conclude with ethical and political research .
of course , , you &apos;re , you you like <unk> .
we call it &quot; <unk> . &quot; you focus on what &apos;s going to be .
and it &apos;s also me . i grew up as poor poor child a <unk> family in the south bronx , everyone lived in the the and in the present .
let &apos;s take the the .
here &apos;s a beautiful picture of the <unk> , the largest <unk> of in on the our milky way .
it &apos;s cold , <unk> and <unk> , maybe maybe it , and maybe they &apos;re on the bank of a <unk> <unk> .
i can &apos;t tell you how this was to see the first images of the probe of the surface of the surface . this was what we saw .
so here is a video of the from the <unk> that that that dunes , and the dunes are 100 feet , , , have a distance from some miles miles and and and and and and .
so , the earth is still the only planet , where we know it &apos;s all over life .
they had lost 40 percent of their country and and , and they have no free access to the the of the west bank .
<unk> : this is a <unk> <unk> .
so we did a a .
they just needed it four days .
and like the rest of the brain is it neurons .
in the the of the the , you actually find cells that are in the the the , that are respond to the , , and edges in a particular distance and the the to the the or mouse , if they actually studied the
and this would be shown by the fire of the .
he wasn &apos;t the only man who was on a america without <unk> , and he was not the only great great of of the time .
and why should anyone about this ?
people don &apos;t buy what they do , but why they do it .
the neocortex is responsible for all our we and and and and and and language .
it &apos;s always the same three things , so we look at it .
and when you talk about what you think you will get the they think you &apos;re believe .
the reason that people were bought an iphone in the first six hours hours hours hours hours hours , he was her worldview , and her will will , and they will be the first .
people don &apos;t buy what they do , they buy why they do it , and what they &apos;re doing is what what you &apos;re doing as evidence for what you believe .
and by the way , he gave the &quot; i don &apos;t have a dream &quot; i did a plan plan . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget how cartoons in <unk> on the the .
when this <unk> the office for <unk> in washington , d.c. , the <unk> clinic clinic , they were <unk> .
and we decided to use protect us to this purpose .
what if we had an an waiting room where you just not just just <unk> , when you &apos;re sick , but you you come to to be healthy .
and you leave them with the belief , the ability and the , , our most fundamental hopes in public public care .
i i believe that the end , when we took our health care , not not to the who are are , , are measured , but it &apos;s be the disease that were avoid .
the is is the a real danger of the world , but this is in the indian ocean .
we get it with this <unk> . . on the board of music .
85 percent of them can &apos;t read if you enter the afghan . .
multiply the <unk> of cooperation with <unk> , how security is actually completely completely different .

remember , remember this , this is a fun of me when the <unk> were , you know , you count the points for gore , count the points of bush . count again .
the circles are the countries .
some countries had the time .
but we have to to the u.s. states to the the the same health that that there is today in the philippines .
it &apos;s really changing .
this looks like a happy story .
what you &apos;re doing -- on the altitude you -- -- it is their daily . .
it &apos;s about food .
it &apos;s this dumb concept of the developing world that us , argentina and and , 50 years ago , and said that that is a bad .
governance . a work government -- that &apos;s california from the the from the . .
and i showed shown the way that seemingly impossible will possible possible .
and the enemy quite weak .
we &apos;re -- despite -- -- with with with with afghanistan .
&quot; it &apos;s not a ideal world , &quot; and their government doesn &apos;t get us closer to . . &quot;
what would a set of of of ?
what we we need to be in the back is a <unk> <unk> .
do you want a better system ?
and the doctor says he just just &apos;t should move it that way .

i don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to happen . it &apos;s not very likely .
since we we &apos;re under this scenario , and go away from the present climate .
not just how we do better it , but what are the risks and effects effects ?
here you see a fish with with <unk> , <unk> eyes .
really incredible . here are two males .

we know that we know that we can find something in something that you call a little paradise , and what can be <unk> .
the mirror allows this , but the mirror is not not , it , it &apos;s not not changing by these images .
