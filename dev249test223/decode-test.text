you know , one of the great <unk> <unk> travel travel and one of the the of the the <unk> research , in common to people who are still to the the the the the , and the the the the the the the the the the <unk> , the the <unk> leaves of the plants .
just that that , that <unk> are still beyond the milky way , the the the the of the of the of the of the of the , , or in the himalayas , the the , , the the of of of ways that we have our our , , , , , , , a lot of generations .
and of course , we all share the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we are kids to the world .
we through through .
we have to go through the <unk> <unk> of death and so we should not surprise that we all sing , dancing and and and .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique <unk> of the , the the of the dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the the in the forests of <unk> , or the <unk> in haiti , or the <unk> in the <unk> , , the the , , a month , or a a a a a a a a , , , , , , , , the <unk> of the <unk> , everest , the <unk> of the world .
all of these people teach us that there are other other , other ways , other ways of other ways to the earth .
and that &apos;s a idea that if you think about it to you can only to to hope .
together , the <unk> cultures of the world of the world is <unk> and <unk> life that the earth and and for the earth is as much as the the biological <unk> that you know as a biosphere biosphere .
you can can this cultural <unk> of as a <unk> , , and the the of of all idea and dreams , myths , and and , that that have been the human imagination since the the of of consciousness .
the <unk> is is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we are are as a amazing species .
and as the biosphere is was up , this was with with the <unk> -- at at more speed .
no biologist would make a a car that 50 percent or more of any species are before , because , because it &apos;s not true , and yet , this -- the <unk> of the the of the of the the of the cultural diversity of cultural diversity .
and the key of of this is the the . .
as every one of you in this room , we were talked about 6,000 languages .
now one language is not just the of of the or or a series of <unk> .
one language language is the real mind .
it &apos;s a tools that is the the soul of a certain of the the world world .
every language is like a <unk> forest of the mind , a a , a a , , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and from these 6,000 languages , we &apos;re sitting in in monterey , exactly half the ears of kids .
they &apos;re &apos;t taught to be , , that means , if nothing is done , you &apos;re already dead .
what could be more lonely than be to be a of the the people people who people who who are to to the language , have no opportunity to have the wisdom wisdom , or hope hope hope hope hope hope ?
and yet , this terrible destiny , something somewhere somewhere on earth , about two weeks , because two weeks , because two weeks , a older person , and the the last <unk> of an old language with the grave .
and i know some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; &quot; wouldn &apos;t the be better better , if we only speak one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be a <unk> . . let &apos;s be . .
let &apos;s be . . &quot;
and then you may see how it would be if they can &apos;t talk their own language .
so i want to to take you on a journey through the <unk> journey through the <unk> , , a short journey through the to try to understand what what actually actually lost .
now there are some of us that the the way that i , i say , &quot; different ways of of spirit , &quot; really different of of society .
so , for example , this child in the northwest of the amazon of the amazon , the people of the <unk> , , they they &apos;re <unk> the the from the east east from the satellite of sacred snakes .
this is a people that doesn &apos;t matter <unk> between the colors and green , because the the the the the the the the , is <unk> .
they have a <unk> , language , and a <unk> called called a called a <unk> , : you have to marry somebody who talks another language .
all of this in the the the past , the , the the of these big houses where because of the <unk> six or seven languages , but , , , , is that you never makes a language .
they &apos;re only hear to and talk to talk .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes i &apos;ve ever lived in the the in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people first first was in in in in . .
in 1957 , five <unk> of in in 1957 , and and made a <unk> mistake .
they they <unk> <unk> photos from from the air , what we were going to be as a kind of the , and they were that people in the in the in the in the in the in the .
they took up this photographs of the floor floor , tried to see the face , or the figure , nothing and <unk> that that that has the the the the and killing five <unk> of the the .
but the <unk> didn &apos;t just have the with the <unk> .
they &apos;re each other .
<unk> percent of the deaths happened through <unk> .
we were the eight 50 generations , and we found two cases of a natural death and when we were people with a little bit about it , they they they were that that was so old he died , he died , and we killed him with the spear .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was amazing .
their workers could have the the of of the of steps , and and the animal of of this was .
in the early years , i got a really amazing task when i asked me to go to the to to go to haiti and and the secret societies that were the the of of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , to make it to make <unk> .
and to to give a sense of this , , of course , i had to know something about this remarkable belief of the knowledge and <unk> is not a <unk> of the black magic .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex <unk> of .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i ask you to ask you to the big world of world , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , or or whatever .
a continent is always left up , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there &apos;s a and and of course , there &apos;s a and <unk> of the very <unk> of of the very very religious , the the the <unk> .
but what &apos;s interesting interesting is is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living give the the .
the the can be <unk> from the big water , , answers to the rhythm of the dance to in the the of the living country , so that the <unk> for for a short moment for god .
<unk> the <unk> , &quot; you , &quot; your white goes into the church and you speak about god .
we &apos;re dancing in the temple , and we become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to taken from the mind . how can you be to ?
so you see this amazing demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> , , the <unk> coal , , , an amazing notion of the spirit of the spirit of the body to affect that that it &apos;s in to be in a condition of extreme cheap .
now , all of the people i met , the <unk> <unk> of the sierra nevada of the <unk> <unk> , the most extraordinary .
offspring of the ancient civilization that the the the heart of the the the , and and in the of of the , , this society moved into a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only that were never been from the <unk> .
until to the day , you will be changed by a ritual form , the education is very extraordinary .
the young <unk> , the three and four years of their families and and in a <unk> world of the , , in <unk> , at the <unk> of the for 18 years , two days of the , , , spent the <unk> in the the of the big mother .
and during this time , they are introduced in their values their society , values that that the that that their prayers and their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- balance . balance .
at the end of this amazing , , , you &apos;re going to day , suddenly , soon , for the first time in her life , in old old , , you see a a , and in the the of the , , , , and the the , , , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really , i told you .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the the brothers and and say that we are the the of brothers , the the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think of <unk> and landscape , we &apos;re either <unk> and the the of the the wild wild , , , which in your <unk> , a <unk> , or the hand , and say , these people are connected to nature than we .
so , , are neither , , they &apos;re going to be the the <unk> . .
there &apos;s not a lot of place in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the cold <unk> of tibet , they , but , , a a <unk> of the earth , which is that the the idea that the earth can be in the human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid from the the that that in in that , that is a mountain is a <unk> that is a a , , a a , a a a a , a a a a a a that is a a a a of of of rocks that can be away .
whether it &apos;s a <unk> of mind , a mind , a a of of <unk> is is is . .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that the relationship relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of <unk> colombia , and believed that these forests are to be <unk> .
and that was me to another other people when my friends were under the <unk> , who believe that these forests of <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> the the the the world , the their their their <unk> .
now , when you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create more realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . like this this plant .
it &apos;s a photograph that i first had the last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is <unk> , from many of you have heard the most powerful <unk> of of the of the of the .
what &apos;s so fascinating does is not just the <unk> potential potential potential potential of this , , but it &apos;s it &apos;s really , two different sources , and , , , , , , it &apos;s a <unk> of the <unk> , , , and the the of the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> .
this plant contains a very strong <unk> of that that is <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> of the , , how they <unk> this stuff , this substance that also also also a different ways .
this powder is to to a like like a <unk> , , <unk> paintings and and the and and and the on a sea of electricity .
it won &apos;t be a of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have in my professor , richard evan , , who who the the <unk> <unk> with the the of the the the of the , , , and i i that that you could &apos;t get the the of the , you &apos;re not more there to get a <unk> . .
but the thing about <unk> is that they can &apos;t be <unk> , because they &apos;re by a in the human gut , of course , <unk> <unk> with name <unk> , <unk> .
they can only taken in with some other chemicals in some other chemicals that the the mao .
now the fascinating fascinating thing is that the <unk> that are in the <unk> of , , of the of the way that is necessary to <unk> the <unk> . .
how can these people from a <unk> of of <unk> plants don &apos;t find those two <unk> to the , , , if in this way , a kind of <unk> version , so that the whole larger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great <unk> , try and mistakes , what it turns out as a .
but , you say , the indian indian say , &quot; the plant talks to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , , 17 varieties of <unk> that they all all in a great distance in the forest that that our eyes as a kind of like .
and then you ask them how to put their <unk> , and they say , &quot; i thought , &quot; i think it &apos;s about plants .
i mean , do you know nothing ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that you take them out of 17 varieties of <unk> , and they sing to a in a different <unk> . .
now that doesn &apos;t get a ph.d. ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> .
now , the problem problem is that even even the those who have the the of the the the the , , , , , , but , , , in the the the world , the real world , our world ,
so , fact , the fact that you &apos;re not going to be in the 20th century , 300 years , , , but it &apos;s be as an era where we were in and the massive destruction of the earth and cultural diversity on the earth is not the the .
all the cultures were getting over again and over again with new new <unk> .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> were heard not be less on the than they put it and arrow than than than than than than than than than they and and and .
not change and technology would would the integrity of the , . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of
and wherever you &apos;re in the world , you &apos;re going to discover that cultures are not <unk> the , , these are dynamic living living by by by the , , , , and the the , , , the the , , the the , , where it &apos;s <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
or if we go into the mountains of tibet where i can see a lot of <unk> , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> of of people &apos;s in generally convicted , but the <unk> , the <unk> of the life of life , not not not not not not not not not not not not not , but in a of a <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffer , if you don &apos;t have it at <unk> <unk> level .
i went to a a young colleagues of <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> and and and i i i the the of i i , i saw the face of the of the statistics , and , and , million people who were killed by the cultural revolution .
the father of this boy <unk> was identified as his <unk> lama .
this meant he was killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle <unk> with her holiness in the diaspora that people brought up nepal .
his mother was been locked for a for for for the crime .
he was <unk> in the age of two years , to to to her <unk> , , she couldn &apos;t live without it .
the sister that was actually <unk> <unk> , was became a a <unk> . .
she came up on a <unk> <unk> and and for this <unk> , she had to be a in a <unk> .
the <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of people &apos;s mind is something <unk> .
and at the end , we really , we we want to have a a of a , world in a <unk> world of the world or or in a world world world ?
margaret <unk> , the great anthropologist said before she died that it &apos;s the greatest of , as we &apos;re in a a , , , , , we &apos;re going to see a a of of the human imagination , but that we &apos;ve ever ever up out of a dream and forget forget that there ever have other options .
and it &apos;s a to think that our species may have been for over years years .
the <unk> revolution that brought us agriculture , and we the the of the the of the <unk> , the poetry of the <unk> of the <unk> and hierarchy , specialization and artificial , , , and years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this brilliant story doesn tell me that we have all the answers to the challenges that we are in the in years .
when we <unk> these <unk> <unk> , the the of of questions , it &apos;s with with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song we will going to be the opportunity to be that what we are : people with ideas , that that that people are aware of the , that people have to be a space and make a space to and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph that i took on the northern end of the <unk> , when i went to <unk> <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful history of his grandfather .
the medical government government doesn &apos;t always get very well with the with the and and the the of the the of the of of our &apos; , , they were forced to pull into settlements .
the grandfather says the old man refused .
the family that had to his life , he all all weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the the of the the of the no , they they used them to their advantage .
the <unk> of their <unk> were originally were became <unk> in <unk> , , made .
the grandfather &apos;s grandfather wasn &apos;t afraid before the night or the the .
he <unk> out , his pants out of <unk> and <unk> and and and when the when the the , began to , , he it into the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> on the the pages of the and and , and it completely frozen , he was a a dog .
he <unk> the dog and and <unk> a a , , the the dog &apos;s dog and and a a , a a , a a , and <unk> on the <unk> with the <unk> the the the the .
that &apos;s &apos;t how you can do it out of anything .
and this is in many ways , a a of of the of the and of the of the world .
the medical government gave the the of in april 1999 , the full control over a area that is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country , and is called <unk> .
it &apos;s an <unk> area . they control all the <unk> .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can look at and and and and .
and finally , i think , it &apos;s quite obvious , at least for the of us who traveled to these distant goals of the earth , that they &apos;re not all at all .
they &apos;re the <unk> of someone .
they &apos;re parts of the human imagination that the in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children are the of our own children of the of of hope .
what we &apos;ve been doing at national geographic , is that we believe that politicians never never achieve something .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not <unk> , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website has 35 million million million million million million million million . .
making nations send our our .
our magazines read from millions of millions .
and we &apos;re a a series of travel into the <unk> that we we to to in places of such cultural , that that they &apos;re by the the <unk> and and , and , , and you , the the of the the , , that that the world can find the wisdom of all human people .
thank you .
what i first i first to you , as soon as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that which we microsoft as a year , a year , a year , and it &apos;s an environment where you can either be local or a with a huge amounts of visual data .
we see many , many of of of the digital photographs here , which you <unk> and and <unk> , , , , in any ways .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information , we look at how large of these are are or how big the the of the .
most of you are a digital photographs of a camera , but this is a scan of the <unk> , and it &apos;s in a area of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that can the the the of the system like this , is the number of of on on your screen on every moment . it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house of dickens . every <unk> is a chapter .
to to prove that it really is about text and and a picture , we can do something like this to do really , to show that this is a real representation of the and and no picture .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
each big picture is the beginning of a <unk> . .
and that gives you the pleasure and the good experience a real experience of a magazine or a a newspaper , which is a a of a of of .
we &apos;ve also done something about the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we &apos;ve designed a false ad with very high that that much higher than a a regular ad , and we added some some new content .
if you want to see the functions of this cars , you can see you here .
or other models , or even <unk> .
and this really shapes these ideas , these constraints for the the place on the screen .
we hope that that &apos;s not a <unk> and others , more -- that should not need to be .
of course , this is is a really obvious kind of technology like this .
and i really want to spend a lot of time , except to say that we &apos;re going to be this .
but these are all roads in the
<unk> up the the the of the .
let &apos;s get something different .
this is actually live live on the internet . they can <unk> it .
this is a project called <unk> <unk> that which is really two different technologies together .
one is a <unk> , and the other is a very good research on <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> university of washington , under the <unk> of the <unk> .
and rick <unk> from microsoft was done , a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by <unk> .
you can see that if we create this kind of of of of , which we can can through images and can make this experience of the <unk> . .
but the spatial structure of the images is actually in meaning .
the <unk> have these pictures together they they would be the the real , in which that that that that in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , , , and you can see here elements of <unk> slides , or <unk> , and these things have been in in relationship .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ve been time to show them other environments .
there are a lot of <unk> .
i &apos;d like to take a of the <unk> <unk> of of , and that is from a early prototype of <unk> on the time we &apos;ve worked on the summer , to show you that that is the the the of the that , and this is not as obvious as you look at the environments that we have on the
we had to do us about the lawyers and so etc .
this is a <unk> of of the cathedral , lady , , in the computers with flickr , , and they just <unk> and and they will get pictures of men in in and and and and on the and and and and on the <unk> , and , and this this <unk> , that this model .
so this is all <unk> , and they &apos;re all in in in in the way in
and we can navigate to this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i i &apos;m going to work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the the here .
i guess you can see that this is a lot of different ways of cameras : everything is about the <unk> <unk> , , a very large number of of you that all of them in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll be some some of the strange .
many of them are from faces , etc .
there &apos;s a number of photographs -- here you are .
this is actually a poster of of , , was was was right .
we can have to change from the poster in this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment , and it &apos;s now collected data from all the collective memory of the whole collective the , visual the earth -- and everything is connected to each other .
all these photographs are connected together , and it creates something larger than the sum of the parts .
you &apos;re getting a model that comes from from all whole earth .
consider this as the sequel of the of of <unk> of of .
and this is something that &apos;s through complexity that people use it , and and using the user with the user with the application .
their own photos are going to have a a that has a different person .
if someone has made the and and all of this sacred and and and you , who you are all , , and i can see , my photo of the the , , , and i can use them as to start to the in this room , and a kind of <unk> social social of social <unk> of social <unk> .
and of course , , of the are the the rich virtual virtual models of every interesting , of every , of earth that that not only were not just by <unk> or and and and and and so on , through collective memory .
thank you .
i i do you know ? you know , you can the software that a certain time , in the next years , all the pictures that are used in in world in what are in in in the world .
yes . there &apos;s nothing else to discover .
if you want to make them between between between images .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think of the the of information information that have many of these images .
like , if you do a <unk> for images , where they &apos;re sentences and the text of the website , a lot of information that is a picture .
but what if the picture you connected to all the pictures ?
then the the of the <unk> , and the the that makes it , , really , . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . thank you .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you a couple of things about my book , as i hope , in the other things you &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;m going to try to make a few connections , if you didn &apos;t noticed these .
i want to start with what i call &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all western western western western .
the official <unk> works so : if our goal is to maximize the common public public of our citizens , this is all through the <unk> of of the freedom of the .
the reason for this is that freedom is good , , , , , , a <unk> of for human human .
if people have freedom , everybody &apos;s all about to do things that we to to the our our our our , and nobody has to to to us .
we need to to to maximize choice choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom , and the more freedom they have , the more more the they have .
this is , i think , so deeply in our water water , that it would be any in the sense of it .
and it &apos;s also in in in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what we allow us to us .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say about a little bit about <unk> .
there &apos;s <unk> <unk> in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t <unk> the and <unk> and and they they could buy a large number of their own <unk> <unk> , in the , , in the , that &apos;s not the the in it .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then you go to the <unk> business of a a -- speaker -- speaker , <unk> , , , radio , , , and in in this in a of of business , there are so many <unk> facilities .
we can have <unk> millions of millions of different <unk> plants are the the the components that are actually offered in business .
you have to admit that that is a large choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , you could have to the phone who wanted to to to long as long as he came to .
they did your phone , they didn &apos;t bought it .
one of of the was that the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now we almost an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of the mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones .
my favorite is the in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and should you not have seen this in your business , you can be sure they &apos;re going to be .
and what it does is to to to to to and ask this question .
now , what what the answer to this question ?
the answer is no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cell , not too much .
in other aspects of life , which are much more <unk> than than than the are , , the the the of choices .
health -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that they go to a doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor , and the doctor says to them , we could do a a or or we could do b .
a &apos;s this benefits and risks .
b has this benefits and risks . what do you want ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
doctor says , a has got this benefits and risks and b has this benefits and risks .
what do you want ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , , , what would you do ? &quot;
doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . it sounds like a good thing , but in reality , the of of the of of the of the , of the , , not to be the , and that &apos;s not the best &apos;s is a decision to make a decision -- <unk> of the patient .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for for for for people like them and me , if you think about it , &apos;t make sense sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why does it make us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is : you expect to call the the the next morning and call call a change in the .
something as as our identity is now a question of choice to be how this slide is . .
we don &apos;t <unk> identity , we invent them .
and we &apos;re as we as we like to .
that means that every day when you wake up at morning , they need to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the was was , that almost everybody had one , and she could be as fast as they could , and and , and they could be as as they could .
the only true choice was &quot; who , not when , not when they did .
now , all , you have .
i teach wonderful smart smart , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work when i used to .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they are busy with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i get married ?
should i get married ? i i got to kids , or i only do ? &quot;
they are all <unk> questions .
and you &apos;ll ask these questions questions whether that means to do all the tasks that i &apos;m going to and and no good grade in my class .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to <unk> questions .
work -- we are blessed to how carl &apos;s what the technology that us us to allow us to work every day day every day on the planet -- to the the to the . hotel .
there &apos;s a corner of a corner of the way i &apos;m not going to to work on the the .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means that that an incredible freedom of choice we have to make decisions , and again again and again again , whether we should work or not work .
we can watch our kids in football , and we have our mobile phone on the <unk> , and our their to other hip , and our laptop probably on our our own .
and even if you &apos;re all off , every minute in we we the the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> , we we we , &quot; should i think that call call ?
should i to answers to this email ? should i write that letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question , &quot; no , it &apos;s certainly your experience of your child very very different than it was been .
everywhere we look , big things and things things , things things and lifestyle , life is a a question of choice .
and the world in we live in the world .
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world that we live in this .
and the question is , is the good or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good , so i &apos;m going to do about about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on human people .
it &apos;s a effect , <unk> way that he &apos;s us free .
so many options , you can choose , it &apos;s very hard to decide to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of this , a study of investment in volunteers .
a colleague of me , access to <unk> <unk> , , the giant <unk> of about about a million employees and about 2,000 jobs .
and what she was doing was 10 10 <unk> of the who &apos;s the who took the to two percent .
they &apos;re 50 50 <unk> -- 10 percent less employees , if they would only offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 <unk> , that are , to choice , it &apos;s so hard to choose to choose that it &apos;s in it .
and then morning , and tomorrow morning , tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never .
understand that that &apos;s not just that that is to eat food food when they go to the and they don &apos;t have enough money to the the , it also that make decisions so hard to miss the large &apos;s of their . .
they &apos;re not give away to 5,000 a year a year , a year of the who who were happy to grow her own .
paralysis is a a of of many choices .
and i think it makes the world looks like this .
you really want to make the really , when it &apos;s all all , , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment in , or even the wrong <unk> .
so this is a effect . the other effect is that even if we meet the paralysis and make a decision , we we get less happy with the result of the , as if we had had the opportunity to us between us .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is evolved through the large <unk> of different <unk> , , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and it &apos;s not perfect , which is , , it &apos;s a to to the , which is that that they had had a good decision , even if it was a good decision .
the more more possibilities there , the easier easier is nothing to regret regret that &apos;s <unk> for the choice you .
second , what economists call call .
dan gilbert did a a big point morning , he told how how the way we combine things , depends on what we &apos;re on .
well , if there &apos;s very many alternative , , it &apos;s just attractive qualities of alternatives to you that you &apos;re , less happy with the alternatives that they were chosen .
here &apos;s an example . for the of you who aren &apos;t new yorker , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what they should have been .
here &apos;s a few on the the .
very expensive real real .
beautiful beach . great day . they have it all for themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s august .
everyone in my <unk> neighborhood is a way .
i could park right in my house . &quot;
and he he took two weeks of the thought he missed the possibility to have a a a a lot of parking lot .
<unk> is the happiness that we get through our choices , also , when we &apos;ve have fantastic .
and the more more possibilities there are , the more attractive traits of this choices will in into the <unk> . .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon makes some tell you .
he makes a to to about this and maybe , and to do things about it .
but one important point that makes does is always , who decide to decide to decide to decide other things .
and these other things like many attractive qualities , and it will going to do less less powerful .
third : <unk> of expectations .
this was met me when i wanted to about my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all time .
and there was a time in there was only a <unk> of a , and they bought them , and they &apos;ve got a little , , they were incredibly <unk> and and if they were and and long enough , they have started to , &quot; ok .
so , to buy new jeans , after many years of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple jeans here here is my size . &quot;
and the person said , &quot; you want to <unk> , , , or matter ?
do you want to buttons or <unk> or <unk> ?
do you want <unk> jeans ?
so , you would like cut , , , blah blah blah , , &quot; and so on .
my jaw was down , and after i i i i , i i would like to the the the the only way that was the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour of all of this damn jeans , and i &apos;m say the the truth -- and i &apos;m the the the i had ever .
i had better better . all of these choice would would do it better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it myself .
the reason that i felt worse worse , with all those those those those those those those those those those those those things , for a good couple of jeans , went up .
i had very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have a her her her , when it was in some kind .
when they came in 100 species , damn , one of them should have been perfect .
and what i was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i i i what i had to do , and what i had been was was was was to to what i expected .
this is the that the the of people the people the the people people the people are going to be how well they &apos;re going to be like well .
and this leads to to to with the results , even though the results are good .
nobody in the world of the , knows this , because if you would , you wouldn &apos;t know what it is .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is , it used to everything everything was worse than everything was worse than everything was worse , it was possible to people to make a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world we live -- we wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfect as expectation -- the best best for you can hope is is things as good as you &apos;re it .
they never get a <unk> because their expectations , my expectations are .
the secret to the <unk> -- that &apos;s what they all have has -- the secret to the <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short <unk> moment -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really very wonderful .
i wouldn &apos;t have better better better . i didn &apos;t <unk> .
but <unk> is not always a bad thing .
ultimately , a result of a <unk> <unk> a hard jeans if there is a way to buy is that if you &apos;re a , , and you ask why , who is responsible , the the , what would you do ?
if hundreds of different types of jeans are available , and you buy a <unk> , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also the the answer to the question is : you .
they would have better do better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the <unk> , there &apos;s no sorry for mistakes .
and so , when people make decisions , even though the results of decisions decisions are good , they &apos;re disappointed about it , they &apos;re it .
clinical depression , in the world world in the last generation .
i think a a <unk> -- not the only one , but a <unk> <unk> <unk> to this air , and also suicide , and it is that people people have the <unk> are so high , and then if they have to explain those experience themselves , you think it would be their .
and so the the is that it &apos;s going to be , , , , , and we feel bad .
so let me remember you .
this is the official <unk> that that we &apos;re all of right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that &apos;s a lot better than no , but it doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s more lot of choice than a .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve that a long time that we have our our our our our our our .
now , as an an a question -- i &apos;m almost done -- as an an rule question , the thing about thinking about , what all of these choice is in in the industrialized societies , the material is wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of them , the problem is not to great . .
your problem is that they have too little .
so , things things i &apos;m talking about is a kind of kind of kind of , rich , western societies .
and what is so frustrating and and : steve <unk> has been told you yesterday about how this expensive and hard car car , not to help car car car car . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that this expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that they don &apos;t help .
they even hurt .
it &apos;s doing bad for that we &apos;re doing bad .
if something of what the people our society make decisions decisions decisions that people people to to to , not only would not only live the life of people , but our , but our our of life .
economists call this a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is going to be better -- not only the the poor -- because all of these great choices of us .
so , , reading this cartoon , please , and an <unk> person , says , &quot; ah ! what knows what this fish ?
you know nothing possible in this <unk> . . &quot;
<unk> imagination , an <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to the that that something something something something .
because the truth is that when you break the <unk> , so that it &apos;s possible , they have no freedom . they have paralysis .
when you break the <unk> , so that it &apos;s possible , it gets the happiness .
they increase paralysis and and the happiness .
everybody needs a <unk> .
this is almost with security security -- perhaps for the fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> of is a a recipe for misery , and i guess , .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects earlier before , the human genome and what that could mean , and the discovery of the of of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we we have the biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code into a new phase of biology in a new phase of biology and
we &apos;ve tried to ask to ask .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something i think that many biologists trying to understand and and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried to make different approaches to simplify it up to the the components .
we we have years years ago , when we sequenced the <unk> , , the change the the of the the world of the digital world of the computer .
now we &apos;re trying to ask if we can live live , or whether we can make new live , , from that digital universe ?
this is a map of a little organism , <unk> <unk> , the the the of a species of species , themselves in the lab , and we we tried to do that with one even more genome .
we &apos;ve got it to to about a hundred genes of the 500 or or the that are here .
but when we look at this look , , which is very simple , to our , trust , trust me , that &apos;s simple , but if we all the the we can see one of the other , it &apos;s very unlikely that it would going to be a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to the front is actually to ourselves what allows us to change the individual components and and some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , we can we get an chromosome ?
and it does this really do the chemistry to to do these really , what was never done before ?
and if we can , we can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of <unk> chemical material .
our steps in the of of life .
our ability to write genetic code has <unk> , but yet , and our last point would put on an exponential curve .
we started started with 15 years ago .
and it took a a of , we were starting with a <unk> before before we were the first experiments .
it turns out , it &apos;s very difficult .
there are tens of tens of tens of the world to make the little pieces of dna , , , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so you get a a piece of more more mistakes .
so we had to develop a new way of we we we to these little pieces and and the the mistakes .
that was our first trial , starting with the digital , , the the the <unk> x x .
it &apos;s a little virus virus that kills bacteria .
we made little little pieces , we made a <unk> and and a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came to we could could be this piece of <unk> chemical and and a bacteria and and bacteria started to read the genetic code and and , and . .
the the of particles have been <unk> from the cells , and come back and kill <unk> e. .
and recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said that this model .
they laughed more than it it .
so we think that this is a situation in the software can build the hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole <unk> chromosome , it has more than <unk> <unk> genetic code ; we we we we in the of the virus that we could vary the size of the , which is the individual components of a living cell .
design is the key , and when you want to start with digital digital information in the computer , that digital , to be really be .
when we &apos;d been the genome first first back in 1995 , the <unk> <unk> had a mistakes in a mistake .
we found the 30 30 mistakes , and if we were the the original sequence , it never never been possible .
part of the design is to make pieces of the for the or the and the other people , to to to to to make smaller <unk> , to to this .
we &apos;ve got unique elements here .
you might have heard that we have <unk> .
think about it : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g , and .
<unk> of this letters -- these letters things about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose of every of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
at first we just signed signed .
some people were disappointed that it was no poetry .
we &apos;ve the the things that we could simply just them them , and , and there are enzymes that fix these fix and bring together .
and we started to start to , starting with the , from the to to <unk> letters , in the , in the , to to to into the , to to into those of to to to .
in every step , we have these these in the , we could they could they could they were trying to create a very robust process of what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of the . .
so , this looks like a <unk> . .
if we get to to this really large pieces -- with 100,000 <unk> and -- then they &apos;re not going to grow in e. , and it &apos;s all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we we other mechanisms .
we knew from a mechanism of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is the biology to fix dna , that can can together .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s a organism called <unk> <unk> of the three million wheel of radiation .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome falls apart apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything was it was it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be been up , they can even live in vacuum vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life in space , and can move , looking for <unk> conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot out there there .
here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we &apos;ve using using these processes -- we actually used using the <unk> of the the we we we have <unk> the the design of , and yeast , it
this is not a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the <unk> . .
these are images of a about a .
that &apos;s the the that we &apos;ve just done done recently .
these are about <unk> letters of <unk> code , it &apos;s the biggest molecule with <unk> structure has ever been created by people .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we print it with a <unk> of 10 and 10 , it would be <unk> pages , just to the genetic code .
now , how do we start an chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s a very simple , it &apos;s a lot of complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easy to do it in the way we &apos;re doing it , you just just the the out the , and there &apos;s one else , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard
in <unk> , the chromosome in the cell , but we &apos;ve just shown that you can a a a a a of a cell to the other , and can can can that .
we were the chromosome of a <unk> , , , said , two are both of these two as people and mice , we we were a a that we we were to to the the , and it was very amazing to destroy all the proteins , and it was very amazing to be the proteins -- and they &apos;ll estimate our very <unk> graphs .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that here is the end , but we tried to get the process to little bit further .
this is the <unk> of of evolution here .
we &apos;re all all species species here a second chromosome or a third of <unk> , , every times and thousands of characteristics in just a a a species .
so people who are in evolution as a gene is really a a a a lot of biology .
there are enzymes that are the <unk> the the are actually eating dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell was none ; the chromosomes that we &apos;ve up .
it was the in the cell , and it realized the other chromosome as a <unk> <unk> , and so we had just had a cell with a new chromosome .
it &apos;s <unk> blue , because of genes we &apos;ve been . .
and after a very short time , it has lost the characteristics of species and and in a new species based on new new new software that we &apos;ve given the the cell .
all the proteins change change the the &apos; &apos; than we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve . .
it may sound like <unk> <unk> , but we can can , by the the , things are quite dramatic .
now i i that that that &apos;s not the <unk> -- -- is is is in a billion billion years .
and i &apos;ve that that we might be a new form of the <unk> explosion in the that there &apos;s massive new new of based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s quite obvious on what we need .
we &apos;re by six to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to ask it in my context : i was born in year .
today , there are three people on this planet for every year , in the year , it &apos;s four years of it .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for for billion people .
it will offer a challenge for nine .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion of of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million million million . day .
if we &apos;re thinking about biological , or any process process to replace this , it will be a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s the co2 co2 from this material that is into the atmosphere .
we &apos;ve got , from our our of our our world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that this is the the of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components components , and look at the diversity of it .
we &apos;re going to the the the the of the biological reality and and of our our idea .
we we have technologies today that these these fast <unk> of this , to what we call <unk> genetics .
we have now the to build a a of robots that can make a a of the a a a day .
if you &apos;re able to make these 20 million different genes or create these processes to provide or create drugs , drugs , , we can only change a small team of biology than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can <unk> <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals or <unk> <unk> and so on .
this is a shot of real <unk> that we work with actually sit and actually sit and new species of design .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it will look like . we know exactly how the genetic code will look like .
now we &apos;re now on at the of of the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve seen corn medical medical members of which is a bad experiment .
we have some fuels of the and and third generation , the very , that are going to be much higher higher <unk> , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but , we think the only way to make biology , a of the the of the the of the the of the the of the , is is when we see co2 as a , , and so we &apos;re working on cells that go to the way
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first of the fourth generation , and that in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is a organism that we described in 1996 .
it lives in the deep , , about <unk> miles deep , almost <unk> <unk> .
it it it co2 in methane in the using hydrogen hydrogen power . energy .
we we we can study if we can use carbon co2 that could just get to <unk> , the co2 in fuel , to make that process .
within a short period of time , we we could be able to solve one of the basic questions of life .
you know , we really have -- <unk> goals like the <unk> of the entire <unk> industry , and if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where you can do it ? a <unk> of energy .
but we &apos;re working on that , we &apos;re working the same approaches to the development of .
you &apos;ve seen it this this this year , the flu , and we &apos;re always a a year and and a a a a a a a a right at the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by <unk> vaccines in the <unk> .
that &apos;s how the future might be be be , be accelerating with the , , , synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and perhaps <unk> .
we &apos;re a light light years from years from our our , our goal is just that we have a chance of to survive long enough to do that . thank you . much .
and at the last ted conference i gave a introduction to the lhc .
and i promised get back to explain to you how the machine works .
so it &apos;s far . and for all those those those who were not , the the the the the the the the scientific experiment ever -- 27 kilometers in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that were less less than a a second second of the universe -- and that was to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just ambitious ambitious .
this is the machine below geneva .
we take images of these <unk> of in detectors .
i &apos;m working on this . he &apos;s called an inconvenient detector -- 44 meters in the diameter , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction of the the way to see the scale .
on september o last year , the machine was the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it &apos;s a huge huge <unk> of the room control .
it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> of the the the the the the the lhc , , , to a part of the lhc <unk> to to a rain of particles to
in other words , when we saw this picture on september september , we knew that the machine works , which is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this &apos;s the biggest <unk> <unk> , or , , as someone could be the google side and front page of the front page .
it means that we &apos;ve the cultural impact on the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that was doing with this this , -- -- this golden wires here here .
these wires relate to <unk> when the machine is on <unk> .
now , the engineers are you you you and say , &quot; no no , they &apos;re not . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford to , because if you &apos;re very far , , you &apos;re going to call it .
so , minus the degrees , , than the space between the stars , can can can be able to make it .
in one of the connections between <unk> magnet , the lhc , there was a <unk> . .
it heat up and the the and and <unk> <unk> of the . of .
this was the result .
now , it &apos;s all amazing , if you you imagine that the magnet has over 20 tons and and over 20 inches .
so we we can about about the world of the magnet
and had to remove what we did .
we <unk> them , <unk> them .
they &apos;re all back back to your way .
the end of march , the lhc will be to be <unk> .
we &apos;re going to put it up , and you can expect to collect data in june or july , and put our journey to find out what the building blocks of the universe .
now , of course , in a kind of <unk> , again , again , the debate about the value of science and <unk> on this . it &apos;s easy to be .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to get the the that we &apos;re going to move out of the , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going my <unk> words of a english scientist , <unk> <unk> , who , who , he was the <unk> experiments his <unk> his <unk> , his apprentice , his was , , , that our our human are , , that our our our , , and there are no new worlds . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
my books is my job , but it &apos;s more more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , my , and and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect to change that .
but the recent thing is a lot in my life and and my career that has me to to to the work completely .
this this was a a book was recently -- a a a a a called <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love , love , , , that , in any of my previous , went out and a big <unk> , international <unk> .
the result is that i &apos;m doing , i i &apos;m going to get treated as i &apos;m going to be the .
seriously seriously -- the <unk> <unk> !
for example , they come to to me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you never be <unk> that success ?
don &apos;t you fear that they will be their their entire life and never created a book that anyone in the world ? never ? ?
okay , that makes the .
but it &apos;s worse worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was about 20 years ago when i was when i was a when i was a , i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of <unk> reaction .
people said , &quot; you have no fear of &apos;t have to have success ?
do you know you &apos;re not afraid you to the the of a <unk> ?
you you don &apos;t afraid you have to <unk> your life your life and and and it never come up and you you would going to die on a <unk> of dreams -- your mouth filled with the <unk> <unk> of the ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the quick answer to all of questions is : <unk> . .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always had .
and i &apos;ve a lot more things that nobody would be to to . .
like algae -- and other <unk> things .
but , when it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been about to , and i , why ?
is that kind about ?
is it logical that that should be expect that he was afraid to do that work to do the
and what is the creative , , that that they make us make us make the of of of the of of the , in a way that other jobs are not doing ?
my father , for example , , was chemist , and i can be a situation in the in the years of a chemist , who he was asked to be be .
with your <unk> , john -- how do you do with this ?
just didn &apos;t know , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemist have not get the the of the of <unk> of <unk> .
we we would be , we we would be that kind of call , but not just the writers , but the the of of all the <unk> , seem to have that call , be incredibly unstable .
all you have to do is , the <unk> <unk> of the the the the the the the the the the the and and often months of own hand .
and even the who don &apos;t actually <unk> <unk> , , were really , to their talents .
norman <unk> said before his death in his last interview : <unk> of my books had killed me a little bit of . .
a extraordinary statement that you can do about their <unk> .
but we &apos;re not even even when we hear somebody somebody such something , because we know this kind of tell a a of the , and we we we , and of course , and and , and , and and art -- and that art -- and the the -- and the the .
the question i want to ask everyone here today is this idea is it &apos;s all right ?
so , do you feel like that ? because with only a centimeter of a , i feel not not not that i &apos;m not going to
i think they &apos;re . .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to watch how they &apos;re going to the next century .
i think it better if we encourage our big creative creative .
and i definitely know that it was for me -- very dangerous in my situation -- very dangerous , start to start to the this dark path of guess the idea of the -- particularly in the fact that i &apos;m in in my career .
that &apos;s -- -- i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years .
i i have another 40 <unk> of <unk> .
and it &apos;s very likely that all i &apos;m going to write from the world as a job , which is the the the of of my last book , right ?
i say it , because we &apos;re all kind of friends , we we &apos;re all kind of a friends -- it &apos;s very most that my biggest success behind me .
oh , jesus , what thought thought thought .
these are the kind of thoughts that can get somebody to start to at nine o o o , , and i don &apos;t want to .
i would still do that work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some of the <unk> , , , it seems to me to to to to to to to have a kind of <unk> psychological psychological building .
i , i have to find a way to find a a a a a distance distance to me and my very natural <unk> of about how the reaction to be on writing .
while i &apos;ve been looking for models in the last year , to do that , i &apos;d also looking for , and i tried trying to find other societies to see , to be able to help the the the the the the the the the the the the problem . creativity .
this search for me to the old , and the old rome .
please follow me because the circle will going to end up again .
but in the old greece and rome have people not believe that creativity of people , okay ?
they thought creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> , , from a distant , unknown source of people -- -- -- of <unk> , , &quot;
the greeks called this <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> <unk> .
by socrates , he believed he believed he had a <unk> that he was <unk> to <unk> .
the the had the same idea , called this kind of <unk> creative creative spirit of <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s great . the the thought thought they didn &apos;t really think a genius was a a smart individual .
they believed that a genius , this kind of magic magic , , , that was literally in the walls of a <unk> -- -- about like <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> and the the of the work of the work of the work .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s , there &apos;s a distance that i talked about -- the psychological building that protect you from your your .
and everybody knew that it was so , right ?
the artist of the was protected , , of things , , for example , too much , , right ?
if your work didn &apos;t work for you , you couldn &apos;t take all for you , everybody knew that you had this <unk> genius that had to have .
if your job is <unk> -- no no no your your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew , your genius was been a little bit .
so people have thought of the in a very long time .
and then the renaissance came everything . and we had this big idea , and this big idea , and this great idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual to the center of the universe -- and it &apos;s not a space for a creatures that are by by the .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational , , and the people started to believe that creativity has completely completely by the own individual .
for the first time in history , people hear people this artist , these artists -- instead of that he has a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think a a person to allow that he thinks , or it was like the like the the , and the the the the the the , , , , a a lot of a a lot of responsibility to make a <unk> of human human .
it &apos;s like to ask somebody to make the sun .
the and and and all the egos , it creates all of these <unk> expectations . success .
i think that this <unk> is the our artists of the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe to a ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the the the of the of the .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t <unk> rational <unk> for 500 years of <unk> , in a <unk> talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience that really <unk> <unk> <unk> , the idea of the -- -- -- -- <unk> , people and <unk> and and on their projects on etc .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i i &apos;m to to , why not ?
why not that ?
because it makes much sense , as anything that i heard about , when it was about to explain absolutely crazy <unk> of the creative process of the process .
a process that -- like anybody knows that it tried to make something -- -- in other words : actually , everybody here -- not not certain . .
indeed , he can feel really feel <unk> .
i had been an encounter that i was the extraordinary american american poet <unk> stone that now , the world , but she told me that she was in the the <unk> , she she she she she was , and she she she &apos;d feel like a poem on the landscape .
she said it would be a <unk> train .
it was going to to the land on it .
she felt , when it came , because it would get the earth under their feet to the . .
she knew that they could only do one of a moment , and that was -- in in their words -- <unk> race as the devil .
she ran like the devil as she was by this poem , it was the only thing that it was to to a a of paper and a a pen , so she had to get it through it , and it and could be and on the the .
in other people , you didn &apos;t get fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but they didn &apos;t get the house and and he would cut it on and she she she she she she said , and she said , and -- -- -- <unk> to a a more poets .
and then there were this moments -- the i will never forget -- she said that there were the that that they were almost .
so she &apos;s going to house and and and the the and the poem goes through through her , and she she &apos;s a pen when it she was and then -- she said -- she was like it was like to to your hand and get it .
she fell the poem at his tail , and it it back in her body and and took over the paper .
in those opportunities , the <unk> <unk> and <unk> and all the on the , -- -- -- last word for the first .
when i heard that i i thought , this is a -- -- that &apos;s just the same way my creative process .
that &apos;s not at all my creative process -- i &apos;m not the the .
i &apos;m a <unk> . . to work on to work at the same day , and i , and <unk> me , <unk> and really <unk> .
but even i in my my , sometimes this thing <unk> .
and i guess many of you have done that .
even i had work work or ideas that from from a source of <unk> that i really can &apos;t identify .
what is this thing for a thing ?
and how do we do with this without our minds , but we we to to to the in health health health ?
for me , the best living example , how to do this can do this , the musician , tom <unk> , i was going to interview it a a few years ago .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of the time , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of of <unk> , which was in in in and with them .
but then he was older and and up . he told me that he was one day on a <unk> in los angeles , and it changed everything for him .
he went a high speed at a , a a a a a a a a , , it &apos;s a lot of it &apos;s <unk> , for it &apos;s <unk> , , and it &apos;s <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s &apos;t believe it .
he has no a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
so he starts to to this old <unk> into it , like , i &apos;m going to lose this thing and and it &apos;s going to be on this song .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
but instead of get out , , he was just on .
he ended up the all the and and , something completely new .
he just looked in the heaven and said , <unk> excuse me , can you &apos;t see that i drive ?
i can i see like this i could i a song ?
if you really want to exist , come on a a moment , if i can care about you .
if you don &apos;t , <unk> today today .
let &apos;s <unk> cohen cohen .
his whole <unk> of <unk> changed changed .
not the work self . it was still as dark as ever as and ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> that around it was was was was he was , he did nothing to a space , and he he he he he he he was he he he was not a <unk> , <unk> thing .
there could be a <unk> , , , , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , , , , , , that &apos;s not quite more tom .
and when i &apos;ve this story , it was a little bit of the way i i worked and and it has been saved me .
and this idea named me when i was in the middle of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , , i fell into one of these these these these these these of the that we all of work , and it &apos;s not it . you &apos;re going to think that it &apos;s been a disaster . that &apos;s ever written .
not not bad , but the worst of all time .
i i started thinking , i should just going to the project .
but then i reminded of what tom was talking about the in the and i tried it .
so i i my view of manuscript manuscript , and i i my my my my go to empty the .
i was to to , , , , you , you , you , and i know both if this book is not brilliant that it &apos;s not a , , right ?
because you see see that i &apos;ve all i &apos;ve , i , i i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you have to go up here and you get your your of deal .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that ... you know what , then the hell .
i &apos;m going to go further , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you to that i i i was in my part of the jobs .
because ... the end of it is like following : ago , in the <unk> people in the <unk> people with holy and and and , and they were them , for hours -- for for the .
these are are are great , because the dancers were professional , and they were fantastic .
but again , and , very rare , something special happened , one of the the , actually was actually <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve seen seen a performance in their life .
it was as time time and the the dancers through a kind of <unk> , , he didn &apos;t have anything anything like it had before -- 1,000 nights before . but all it added . .
and suddenly , it no longer he it .
it was been up from the inside , and and all <unk> <unk> through a <unk> fire .
as a thing happened at the time , people knew what was that . they called it in his name .
they put the hands together , and they started singing , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god god god god god god god .
that is god , you know ?
interesting historic <unk> : when the <unk> <unk> they they they they were this practice , and the the , the the of centuries of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> .
when a actors in spain something something , something , something , : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , , , , , , , , it &apos;s a <unk> .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
but , the the part the the the the the the , up and you find that it &apos;s at a tuesday -- and he &apos;s no longer a a <unk> of god .
it &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with with <unk> knees , and maybe he will never be up to this up to this .
and maybe never will never going to call god of god , , but what what do he do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most <unk> of of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so much as the beginning of the , if they didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of their of of them .
if you may only believe that you &apos;re a a -- from a <unk> source of a life of life that someone else &apos;s her on other other , if you &apos;re done .
when we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and so i think in the past months , i was working on the book , that soon , as the dangerous , , , , , to my <unk> to my <unk> . .
what i &apos;m going to say to say , when i &apos;m going to crazy , it &apos;s not afraid .
wouldn not <unk> .
do your job .
be for your own , whatever he may be .
if your job is dance , it &apos;s dance .
if the stupid male , genius that you you you to the side , is to to a a moment of a a of of through your effort , <unk> <unk> !
and if you don &apos;t , dance , your dance .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for for you all of this .
i think it , i feel that , we should teach this .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for for for all of this , , just that you just the just the just of the and the <unk> , to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that that the the arctic <unk> that for nearly three million years of the the of of the of the , to 40 percent of .
but this is not much enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it &apos;s not the thick of ice ice .
in a sense , the arctic arctic <unk> is the heart heart of the heart of the global global . .
it grows in winter and and in summer summer .
the next slide that i &apos;m show you is a <unk> of a <unk> is happened in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is is with red .
as you can see , it &apos;s <unk> to the <unk> , this is the annual ice in winter , and it &apos;s in the summer .
what so-called <unk> called <unk> , five years old , , as blood , which out of the body .
it &apos;s going to be gone from here .
this is a problem , because warming is the frozen the the the arctic ocean , where there are large amounts of <unk> carbon , which is that when he <unk> , from microbes , by the microbes .
compared to the entire amount of <unk> materials in the atmosphere , the amount of double if we &apos;re that a impact .
now , in few flat lakes in alaska , methane from the of of the water .
professor <unk> &apos;s at the university of alaska with another a a a a <unk> in the
wow !
you &apos;re good . the question is , how is it going to us .
and one reason is , this huge <unk> <unk> <unk> into the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume are more bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in in the greenland .
if you want to know how sea sea is up through <unk> , , they &apos;re up into the ocean .
these rivers take a very quickly .
at the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest <unk> of on the planet .
last month ago researchers , the entire continent has a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> that that came up with a couple of <unk> , is particularly strong in the .
this is 20 feet , , the <unk> .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , , , see , we &apos;ve got new lakes that were in a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people around the world get half of their <unk> of of this .
in the the , that glacier is the <unk> for for this city .
the <unk> have been . .
but if you &apos;re <unk> , it &apos;s too <unk> to be most of water water .
in california , a 40 percent reduction in the sierra &apos;s <unk> .
this is the the <unk> .
and the predictions of you you you have , are seriously .
this <unk> <unk> around the world leads to a dramatic increase in
and the disasters in the world have in a really <unk> and and and , and , and .
four times the last 30 years in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it <unk> .
in the last five years , we produced 70 70 tons of co2 co2 -- -- million tons of tons of every day into the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific , the the west west and <unk> of the indian <unk> , where there is a a <unk> decline in the ocean .
the largest single factor for global warming , , , which 20 percent , is is burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most about the problem .
the united states are one of the two largest <unk> , , together with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot of other <unk> .
but we start to see a change .
here are the that have been taken in the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
<unk> is a political battle in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a <unk> dollars of <unk> <unk> to to clean coal , which is a a a . .
this this image reminded me of something .
around christmas around went around to me home in tennessee , a billion tons of <unk> .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is in our entire country of the <unk> of america .
this happened to christmas .
one of the most of the <unk> for christmas was .
<unk> of the <unk> is a <unk> , happy fellow .
it &apos;s in in skin and <unk> in america , and it helps our economy .
<unk> , the <unk> is is going to day .
he &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is is the <unk> of <unk> .
let me say one one of the . al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , they don &apos;t know what they talk about .
so the the has has been the the two two . .
this is one , part of it .
in the <unk> , we see climate change as a serious itself in the business .
so we took it to the top <unk> , a a of a to to a a <unk> of a to to the the truth about coal .
the fact is is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and smells still clear
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
let &apos;s take it quiet .
<unk> coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of these modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean <unk> .
and yet , burning of the of of the whole problem warming is , the the <unk> <unk> that you see here , changes everything .
look at this , this is today &apos;s , , clean <unk> .
finally , the most kind of the the the the of our economic challenge , and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the the <unk> that that that that that that our our our our <unk> of the like dirty coal and <unk> oil
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to make us from of this <unk> .
<unk> america with 100 percent clean electricity , within the next 10 years .
a plan to bring america back to work , and help to stop the global warming .
finally , a solution , is big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america . find out more .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of of america .
one of the fastest ways , our our of , dirty , , our our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a energy system .
new investments to create good for jobs .
<unk> america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
if you want to get to get , go . &quot;
we need to come far , and quickly .
thank you .
i want to start asking you to the time of their childhood when they were playing with <unk> .
as you realized , how you put out of your hands and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> and and , they actually learned to to think and and and to understand and change the . .
the spatial is think is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer computer -- inspired by the kind of our our with our <unk> , and my my my <unk> <unk> , , i started to wonder , what if we could able to be in the , , and , and , and to take and and and and and and and and and and and and and to and and and to and and and as we ?
this question was so <unk> that we decided to explore the the answer to the and and <unk> .
in short , a <unk> is a interactive computer in the size of a <unk> . .
you can get to with the hand , you can can each other , they can carry their movements and they have a screen and a a . .
more importantly , are physically , you &apos;re just how to do it &apos;s just through the of the hands and access .
and the <unk> of the are an example of a new generation of <unk> of the digital data .
and when these tools become physical and consciousness , to your movements , each other and the the of of our <unk> with them , then we can see with some new and and and more .
i start with some simple examples .
this is is the <unk> <unk> , and when i put it into a direction , the video , the video , then when i put it into the other direction , it it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other .
so if i put them in next , you you you interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by the , you can see it , and can be little nervous .
and they &apos;re also their movements and their .
an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to realize was that we could use everyday gestures on the data , like as to as , as as as you do this with fluid .
in this case , we have three <unk> of as a <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to <unk> color in the middle , where they will mix up .
if we <unk> it , we can a little bit .
there are also some nice ways in education like languages languages , mathematics , mathematics , , where we have the people the the way to the the and and the the results .
here i am -- this is a series of a that i i &apos;m with a simple <unk> . .
this is a game with words that is a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
so , you get every round of you to to <unk> <unk> , and you &apos;re trying to make words , you &apos;re going to be a a of a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s <unk> again , and you get a new new and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are some kids that came to a trip to the media lab , and i was able to try and try and and a video of it .
they really loved it .
now , interesting interesting thing about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
all you have to say is , &quot; , words , &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s a couple of people who test it .
this is our youngest <unk> down down down there .
it turns out he wanted to come up the <unk> . .
so it was just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for for <unk> .
this is <unk> .
he can bring new characters into the scene by by the the the table from the table that shows this character .
here he &apos;s going to rise the sun .
the sun goes on on
now he he a a in the scene .
the orange grove .
good job ! yes !
by the the <unk> , and she &apos;s looking at the , , he can the characters .
... its own history .
hi !
it &apos;s a story with open end , and it can decide how they evolved .
flying cat .
the last example i i have been time to show this is a <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve developed recently , and in the the of the , like <unk> , <unk> and and and . .
every four different variations , you can pick you you you to use .
and you can can those sound into the sequence that you can can can can can can can can can . any patterns patterns .
and you &apos;re them to just just a a a <unk> a a <unk> .
there are effects effects that can change live , like like hall and filter .
you put it into a particular sound , and it it it it to it .
and then , effects as the pace and volume that you &apos;re on the the of the sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we we start to the the the the in two <unk> <unk> and and and in a a of , and and a a little bit more of the voice .
now i add a a .
now i &apos;m going to do a little of . .
and now i i the filter the the , so i can can the the effect .
i can accelerate the whole sequence of by the the pace of the one or other .
and now i i the filter the the , , for something more expression .
i can change the sequence as it is going to change .
and by this , i don &apos;t have to plan them in , , , you can <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> .
and finally , i can <unk> the the the the , by the the the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my is is to to a new new of of new <unk> of , that can better how our brains and bodies .
and today i had time to give you a part of this new new and and some of the ways that we work in our lab .
the idea i want to give you to the way that we we on the the of of the new generation of <unk> with digital media , the information in our world that our our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking to to with you all the
yes , good day .
i &apos;m really to me there .
yeah , so what is going to be ?
i just have to get a little bit of back , and , and , <unk> with modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology , i &apos;ve been a a couple of years now with the <unk> , and i started started , because i was just to to and and , and it , and , and , what i learned in in
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i was going to get closer to the matter , so that .
i think that molecular biology in general , , , , , , , , , everything that you count , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now is extremely important and much more important , much more important is going in future .
there &apos;s this way of things like this <unk> changed the plants that we changed the .
there are craig venter into the <unk> , the the <unk> , , so gas from algae .
now , there are already things that are completely completely in the everyday , most people don &apos;t really aware of , for example , that allow us to to to to to the , , are are <unk> <unk> .
and the list can continue on on . .
and so , from the interest in this technology , i &apos;m further up with this technology .
so what what we we ? ?
most most most people know that from the .
the computer , , and then it will always be in the media , , , the hacker break out somewhere , and and and and so on .
it &apos;s kind of sad , the <unk> , very sad , because it &apos;s not what what what what what what what &apos;s actually like , and what &apos;s actually in the same thing .
and that &apos;s the <unk> , in the 70s , <unk> <unk> , and and it and it the internet .
and it &apos;s about with a physics physics , creative , way to solve a problem .
and problem , it &apos;s not only a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can also be a a of , , how things simplify , a a question , and how how can you do better , or how can do better .
and it was actually more stuff with software , but there &apos;s also in the <unk> , there &apos;s also a whole <unk> of that with all kinds of <unk> things .
and now , i just see in biology , and i want to to this metaphor that just the the synthetic biology , , that biology is actually a <unk> , because it &apos;s a more dynamic , because it &apos;s matter , because it &apos;s matter , and not just <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also can <unk> and so you can also also like it , so , and i find incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to go a much deeper with a
it actually actually , only to be , , , that this .
there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , , that is the the switzerland , which is with europe and with cooperation in india , which is fact , , , and active people all over the world .
this is a a of artistic , , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and in with with with with with with these technologies and and and and , and , and , , and , , , and , , .
but it &apos;s actually all about that to find a an access to to have a a a of a .
and then there &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
this is from the <unk> of the network , that is actually a of a job , where you you just think of and and online .
they &apos;re a bit more technical , and and a a bit of <unk> , , , then , , , , , , .
and from this networks that made the whole popular , has just developed a scene that i want to to .
here &apos;s the upper left up the the upper left , which is a <unk> , , so basically a a , a a , a a school , a school , where where can come to .
kids , old , all all kinds of people go through , just to , and you , they have a in and look at what you can do when they <unk> .
here is a group on the bottom is a group in indonesia , which is the , , but &apos;s a very long .
already longer than these other two .
and they also are in an artistic aspect of biological materials , and , yes , also <unk> , and combine that in pretty <unk> way .
a group of of that i met a while while while i met a while , which would like to communicate the public , to learn more , what they learn to to in college , and they have to to and and to to people , and to to .
and i &apos;ve up in the other image in the other picture in copenhagen in the medical museum in the the of a exhibition .
and that is , yes , that &apos;s mostly right young people , but the only thing that what what &apos;s actually all the united , is the fascination of technology .
and what you can do with it , and also also on society with and questions , , , , okay , what do you want to do , you you you to to you in the way ?
so , <unk> to be biology , , you need to be certain material .
you &apos;re of course , you &apos;re natural materials , and you also need tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
or , what you &apos;re really understand is a a lab , which is such kind of <unk> machines , extremely , , extremely , , , , , , , , , , and so on .
and our approach was to say , , , , , that , you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s not really necessary because every every every every single has has developed higher technology than most most of , , that &apos;s really .
and i was this premise of this premise that this premise , this premise , brian <unk> in to to a a <unk> , , has a <unk> , , a <unk> , , and , , , and , and then it , and then it made bacteria .
so everybody who &apos;s been a soup of soup that he he left up for long time , also .
i tried to to my lab in my lab , a little , , and then i on on ebay and a a bit of <unk> analysis , , , , , , a <unk> , , , , , , ,
now this should be not a joke , but .
here &apos;s the bottom here in the image , the &apos;s the lab , , so a <unk> garage with with the <unk> of , , the <unk> of the , in in a , and it &apos;s quite interesting , and , and i i a project , i i want to be a project .
and this is <unk> , which also mentioned mentioned , , this , this kind of a kind of <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> of .
and yes , you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively relatively , , so that are are of people who are going to to home , to to big , to the big , , which you have more more more <unk> in in <unk> .
but always the the approach that it just would just be and it it to it .
the first project that we &apos;ve done as as an international group , we we we we were aware of our ourselves , , , , , there are also here as real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people that there are and and and so .
and then came from the <unk> <unk> website of the founder , and we &apos;ve got to make , now , also meet , , and then , and then two , , in london , and , in the <unk> , in in san francisco .
and then , it was also about , , , , who are we , what do we want what want to say what do we want to say ?
and what what are our values , what is our our , , our our ? ?
and we then we have a a <unk> . .
this was quite intuitive , so everybody has just got his of his of his his , his and what would do it , , , then .
and came , my opinion , a good good code .
and then we have the , we don &apos;t , but that &apos;s , i think , it &apos;s relatively good , , , people are right there .
and we even tried to to that it also to the world world world , but there &apos;s no kind of come .
so i think we &apos;re from the <unk> in in the , in the one one one step further than the world world .
yes , what are we doing now ?
a project that i made with the <unk> in switzerland , was that we were an an optical case or or <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s when you focused on a laser , , you can you can a relationship with a in the air or in the in the fluid , and then you move in this focus , so that &apos;s , , so it &apos;s like like a <unk> of like a <unk> . .
this really works that is going to be in academic , , and we we thought , , , , we we get , , then , a a , , the the , , , you you a microscope , you can the a microscope .
this is the bottom .
and then we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> and and the the the the laser and and then try to focus on this camera .
and that doesn &apos;t work , , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of it .
so , another project that from from the french group from paris , that &apos;s , , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and he he he this one , he a a like a <unk> , , such as <unk> or something like this , so he &apos;s busy with <unk> , his his <unk> is sam <unk> .
he he built this this this this this this this this this and and in cooperation that the museum is .
and then the the in in in the in in the in the the chair , put this helmet .
then then their their , , and the after what they thought , or as you thought , are different of of the in the room .
it was a pretty <unk> project .
another thing that is that that that has just to do with this <unk> of that is the <unk> , , that &apos;s the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copy genes genes , <unk> , <unk> , , to make them visible .
so , i now do this the the the scene , the right now , go there there , there , and then they can do these these , then these these these , and then you can say , , , , this this , this this .
and the machines that make something that are quite expensive to buy commercial , , the the <unk> .
and that &apos;s not the <unk> , , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that which also a lot .
so this is just one application of many that you can do with it .
and they have the two were two were two , and and and said , , , , , , and we make it , and and , and have have a open source , so , , , , and now they have the the the of the the of these devices .
i think , of a hundred dollars or something like this .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s not it , in a in a in , where it &apos;s be .
so it &apos;s my my , a very <unk> . .
a project i i started to was a a <unk> .
<unk> is , , , like a kind of <unk> that that is about far , two , or so .
you invites <unk> <unk> and and the <unk> and then then the <unk> in this , and then i got it on <unk> and then then that that that .
so the device that you see there , it doesn &apos;t work .
but that &apos;s so my prototype , the <unk> , , but it &apos;s such a <unk> , so that &apos;s on a branch that would hold on , and and and and and and the pressure was was up to the , the thing is broken .
and then i took a <unk> and and it it .
a <unk> , if you do the full of water , the enough pressure , so i think so 40 to <unk> bar could be on it .
and so , you can go up and and and they go out of the and and they go in the . .
and the commercial device costs about <unk> <unk> or something like something like the 50 .
so it &apos;s not the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically done .
so , the moment , the the the the the the the scene of the the that can raise and and the and and the information and the the that that that more people can get able to get together .
because , like the beginning , it &apos;s an important technology , and most people have relatively little of of and also no chance to make it very well .
because if you &apos;re on it , , , , , it &apos;s not the same as if you &apos;ve it it for it .
and i think technology is always more important in our modern societies .
and if you can also make a good choices in the society in the society and and can can and , you need to need access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it and understand and understand it and understand it and understand it .
and then the <unk> <unk> the the open <unk> and and science science .
so that you you can see a in the , , with these scientific technologies .
and this is the <unk> of from the <unk> .
these are the people who are at at least <unk> on website , <unk> website .
that &apos;s a a amazing remarkable number of people around the world .
and interesting is interesting is that they &apos;re are are in in southeast asia .
that &apos;s i think that are less people people , , there are less people .
so i know of some who didn &apos;t have . .
and this is just the <unk> , , the individual people .
and also in in the , , , this in the places .
and that &apos;s all in the beginning .
as i said , <unk> , it &apos;s only started .
and <unk> , , the <unk> , , the the in berlin was the first , <unk> .
and this is now a a of a a of a very good , , , , , that are are all over the world .
and we &apos;re , of course we &apos;re we &apos;re also spread , and then also also also also connected so well , so that that are can be involved .
and i &apos;d always invite to with with that and also even myself .
now it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not impossible to if you &apos;re enough enough enough enough enough enough enough , you you get too far .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hi .
how do we actually work people ?
this is a question that &apos;s very my my as a , , but also in in the in the <unk> and in in the of all the in the
it &apos;s about how people in in interactive media so so they can use these interactive media , and they can generate an <unk> experience .
because , i think that the interactive media in us , cognitive models , so that that in in in our biological memory , very very , very , very , , and that we can also able to be by interactive media .
and that &apos;s very amazing because you actually believe that these <unk> that that that you &apos;ve taught that the future is actually actually into the future , but actually , the future is exactly the future is in our our .
what are actually actually <unk> models ?
i put it four four and and i want to explain to you .
too , cognitive models , and is the models that we have in the in the thing we &apos;ve been .
and this really models that we &apos;ve got a of natural ratio to the .
that sounds most of that sounds most of .
but i &apos;m going to go into and and i &apos;m going to show you by trying to prove that they have a natural relationship to the .
the second aspect is that we we have absolutely not very , because of this <unk> models in the very , very , , , even though we &apos;re using a <unk> language .
and the third area , explains itself itself .
we all know that the interactive media is in the definition of the , which is the the of of the , and what course , says , we &apos;re going to feel the is as normal .
the fourth dot is that the story is a place for us .
now , this is the with the , which is actually the most kind thing of the world .
i &apos;d like to prove to you .
how many doors has the house in where you live ?
we &apos;re going to be able to do it , , , but it &apos;s going to happen and it &apos;s happening right now .
you go through the spirit of this house , in <unk> , in , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
they <unk> the reality , and it without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and we we hard to give us to virtual reality for instance , the virtual reality in our our , , we can actually do that all the time .
and this wealth that this wealth is to to the reality , which have have the people in the in the times , they had &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have a . .
they had no media media .
the only thing they had , her head was .
and in that head , memory was . .
in this head , <unk> knowledge and with this virtual images , the imagination , , became , and was being passed .
and so it &apos;s so strong in us that we can that we can that we that we .
the interesting thing about it is when i get a little trip .
yes , that &apos;s going .
what &apos;s interesting about this is that that time , the human human human human , and and and medium .
now , if you think of a piece .
what &apos;s media today ?
and then you &apos;ll notice that it has a change .
but i &apos;m going to talk to you .
the , of the <unk> , have been stories .
<unk> , priest , <unk> , called <unk> , , were to to to to to knowledge in stories .
and today , we &apos;re still going very , very strong .
the author of the book book , <unk> , , , , , we &apos;re still a year <unk> hours of the .
that means that for a kid that it to the the of the most of the the of the of the of the of the .
now we think our love is on stories on our stories that we sat on the as a child on our parents .
no , no , no , .
it goes back to the back into the in the .
but for me , the interactive media , the is is in the that that we have in in in our biological memory , to think the ability to think .
i &apos;ve brought you one example of the american <unk> tribe .
and the life lived in the <unk> of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very <unk> area , and you had to navigate there to be to to island to island to to food food .
and they &apos;ve called the called <unk> . .
you might know you know , you know , a little bit about the the australian nations .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have <unk> , but they have used used so <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
and what what what what the interesting thing is that the and and the the of areas of areas of <unk> .
and the the language was <unk> <unk> .
that means you &apos;re about about sound and and and and rhythm .
and those sound and this rhythm have study that the the of of a region , and it has also that that you could able to put this songs and and and and and and on the left , and back to the the back back to the .
why don &apos;t we sing , but why don &apos;t we do from from a to b ?
anyway , to navigate .
what &apos;s happening there ?
it &apos;s what &apos;s going on is so <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed the called the <unk> . .
it &apos;s the the machine machine is that &apos;s is the book and is is the the <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories and our individual memories of our individual memories have in external media .
and the book , and the picture .
so , we , we have a a piece of <unk> .
well , suddenly <unk> to from our to us , and has nothing to do anything .
bruce brown , a known <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , is so far to say that this media media , he says the book , and the the , , and the the , , and so on , that that that that that that that that that have our our our our our and our ability to <unk> .
let &apos;s make a little <unk> .
from the to the the machine .
what &apos;s the our on our thinking and on our our ? ?
then the <unk> of the the in the .
and they are been more in the course of the centuries , more and more <unk> , through the the of the .
so , rather than remember , we have to to , , , common , in common patterns patterns of memories that we can on our personal memories .
we &apos;re not able to make themselves .
we have an abstract abstract language .
we we &apos;t &apos;t in the things in images of images , don &apos;t have to images , but we &apos;re <unk> them our language .
we &apos;ve got to to that things happen linear .
and we have the much as law , and there &apos;s only exceptions , like the <unk> .
what has remained is is the <unk> . .
still still , we &apos;re a <unk> as a <unk> , very , very painful .
the question is , what &apos;s this ? ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we we had the we &apos;ve got the , and we &apos;re now called the called <unk> .
it sounds very <unk> , and it very very , , i know .
but these concepts of the <unk> that we bring us to discover these possibilities back back back .
it &apos;s about about , it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to explain this a little bit .
there are technical concepts like instance , the reality reality , is the the reality reality .
so , if you look at google , for example , , , this is a concept of what we can to to to the world world to the world , which is our our to to to to to the virtual as natural , to to .
another example is the example is what what what what &apos;s possible .
so , of course , in the relationship of my talk , , we &apos;re not going to <unk> us , virtual worlds , the the of the the model of the .
and other other example are the <unk> , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a people .
all of this needs the ability to accept our our , to to to to a a .
i &apos;m in in and i hope that video , a very , very , very , very , very , , which is the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the two <unk> are are here today .
maybe you you you get up , you you get up with the the the the the project .
and this project , i brought around as example , as , again , this <unk> , cognitive models .
the whole is a game , i have to say to say .
and of course , the <unk> of , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say , games , you probably probably probably probably in front of people , any of any <unk> <unk> or or they were in with any <unk> of in the hand .
anyway , they &apos;re doing that in .
this is a game for outside .
and that &apos;s , to think that i the the world &apos;s the , i i i the the world .
and this game connects the virtual world , the the the data the the the we produce , the the world .
i apologize that i must be so much . .
you can can a much better better , there &apos;s more much more than that .
and it &apos;s about that i &apos;m a a city by looking in in the places or negative <unk> .
and so i get from the city , a very different , , a very different , i see , and i see negative and the the of a city and and a a very different , virtual map of a very real city .
and we can see that we see see .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little explanation of what you see .
of course , this virtual world in the walls walls , is is clear .
and with a kind of a , we can make these virtual worlds .
so , i &apos;d like to say that , i would like to end up my talk , and the the sense that the the and the skills that we &apos;ve &apos;ve had from the <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;ve gone to the the of , , , , and that we actually have in the the , , but it &apos;s actually to us back to our roots .
thank you .
yes , i &apos;m very to to to be with you .
i i &apos;ve been asked asked whether this this is a a a <unk> and and i mean instead of
it won &apos;t going to do that .
i &apos;m also going to be a a lot of what &apos;s in there .
but i i &apos;m going to get it .
yes , kids are from nature , or be curious about curious about , designers .
i &apos;m from from house , so i am i i am in the theme of curiosity and and how how how much how well , and why , and why we can also , and , and , and , and so on .
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re concerned with to the real as a .
when professors are going , they &apos;re often going to be in in such n .
and that &apos;s also what i had last half year .
a <unk> of natural called the called interface .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why all all the whole of of the to natural , <unk> <unk> of communication , , and and and so on .
and i just just that i just of these small devices , because things should always to more more , and more , and , and you have to look at what &apos;s actually , for us , of course , what is <unk> or intuitive .
and in the the , i have in the in the in the area , the next generation of the human in in the human human human , to be in the , how how the computer computer or how the computer is changing the the the the the .
so i was interested in , , is which of course , or intuitive .
maybe you have to see this .
why does that happen ?
so if we look at the development of our society , here , here , , we &apos;re moving from the third in the fourth or or <unk> .
so , modern into the <unk> .
each society is by a a <unk> .
at the beginning the the the the language .
so , you &apos;ve found that that you &apos;ve been a a language language , you could communicate with each other , the same cave , or in other , , cities , or villages , and and has kind of <unk> .
the the <unk> was , the language , something very natural , something very living .
you have to learn to , , so no a can be in nature , but we &apos;re learning to and and of course .
it was then <unk> through through ancient society and the first shape of abstraction .
this was a <unk> , because of course , the the language started to <unk> in the , of , which means what &apos;s and and , and , and i &apos;m in and and i and i and i it .
the as i &apos;m <unk> and when i &apos;m and when i &apos;m <unk> , , it &apos;s a different different , as a as there &apos;s a of of .
but then , then the <unk> as the <unk> , , , , .
and then the next generation we &apos;re actually in a .
this is just through pressure and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other .
then , it &apos;s just as a <unk> where , <unk> , and others have said : are you really <unk> if the people start reading , then the after the , , and , and that &apos;s of course , is totally <unk> .
and now we &apos;re going to the next generation and the exciting thing is , just a few hundred years , and we &apos;re really in this in this in that in that that we we know that .
now , is is a confused us of course , because we see see on the one side , the media media social media , facebook and and so on .
so with complete transparency , which is the new thinking , which is the old thinking , don &apos;t tell you that in the <unk> and not a beef , or the beef , or other phenomena , i want to just just that , and and it &apos;s .
and these two worlds are just each other , and thinking .
the exciting thing is , when you look at this guy , this new society , these <unk> , , very of of ways , principles and principles of the from the <unk> .
but now , not at local level , but global level .
we understood that the weather is the .
that the issue of ecology is a global global .
not if i think i think , , , and the neighbor thinks of the , , , it doesn &apos;t work .
that means that is actually a global village , actually become a global village with the same principles , of course , , , , but also the total transparency .
as you know , in the village , who who who who who who who what happens to who and when that &apos;s these these of of our by these <unk> of the global level of global . .
it it &apos;s that we know , and and and and and and and and more and .
as it was going on on the village .
so before the background , i &apos;ve been interested in the , which is , what is , of course , what is we we might have , , what what is we we also , , , , , so what does it do the difference ?
because often because people can can &apos;t get it , it can &apos;t do it to it to it .
so you have to deal with that , which is , because it &apos;s not just it it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s be better .
and when is , of course , , and , and how can i take a a of the and and so so that that that that a a , so that &apos;s a , , so it &apos;s very , , and they &apos;re just to .
you , you , , in the , , with the issue of perception and the <unk> .
and that is , of course , what you start and look and look and says , &quot; okay , now look at the inside the inside .
and what &apos;s it like , , ?
so how do we work when we get there ?
and what does means means , , , , , and how and how do our elements of perception , and how does cognitive stuff happen ?
because steve jobs has , you you you to <unk> to <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
so you &apos;re really going to look at a detail , if i want to do something <unk> or intuitive <unk> , which is what is the heart .
and you you you you &apos;re going to have our seven , , most of thinking , most of you know , there &apos;s only seven , , there , there is the the , , the the , , , and and and and and and .
and to look how do we do information information , how do we take information information ?
to say alone , what is information ?
information is any difference that is a difference .
many , a lot of use the word , but not what it &apos;s about about detail .
but i have to understand in the in the , , when information becomes information , when information is from information and and of information , , and , so i know how i know how i i can feel like , , , , , , or of course .
and of course , how creation is to the perception .
we see this here when i &apos;m things , i can see it at the right , where i don &apos;t know what is salt and <unk> , or i can can can can a a , by doing things .
so , much natural natural , in a a , , , but i can see , where is is salt and <unk> .
and when i say somebody , say , , , , , , you &apos;ll be in the right , where it &apos;s what &apos;s in .
and when the left was also , and then hopefully i that no sugar is in in in , , to be .
but also our perception of how it is us .
for example , these perception in the context .
the right circle is bigger bigger than the small , although it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re actually the same big , and yet , our perception , after what context of what context we &apos;re things .
anybody know what that is ?
<unk> on on .
<unk> <unk> should work .
there &apos;s been more to to my glasses .
so it &apos;s <unk> circle .
a second circle to to to , , , , to . .
and if i &apos;ll take a <unk> <unk> , , , we &apos;re not just looking at one one of unit , which is , circle , , , and we see an unit , we &apos;re not seeing a , , , a circle , a circle , a , a
it &apos;s called <unk> or or or , which is also that us in perception .
and the the the the the , that the most of the the first , the the the .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> , the the and so on .
often , it &apos;s in the third .
but this is a essential important part , if you &apos;re going to do things very intuitive .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting is the looking at .
sounds sound , , but but but so exciting to be really exciting to get to .
so we have the eyes and now think , we &apos;re looking at the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you see see from back back back . front .
and they &apos;re <unk> to a assumption that you see something you can recognize , <unk> circle .
that means we &apos;re not our our , before we see it , back back in our <unk> <unk> to say , okay , okay .
i &apos;ve got this cognitive cognitive <unk> , you &apos;ve got what you want to see .
and that &apos;s then , it comes back .
then it goes back , the front , the the the the the front of the front , and , now , well , well , , and sure , you you see , what you see see , what you
and then it goes back back back , and then it &apos;s actually actually .
so a very , <unk> process , how things kind of things things and and what things things happen to do .
i don &apos;t know who know this picture .
so exactly what what i &apos;ve described .
now , everyone &apos;s trying to see this patterns .
i don &apos;t know who what what .
does somebody see something a stuff ?
a <unk> , , right .
once i saw that that that &apos;s a <unk> in in , you know .
they &apos;ll never forget it , because i &apos;m going to show you where the <unk> is is .
now you see the <unk> .
and further , you &apos;re always seeing it .
that means , i &apos;ve got this this , that they &apos;re not not seeing any pattern , , but i have them <unk> in very very time , over again again , again , again , again , again ,
and this is this projection of the , , , , .
now i &apos;m i &apos;m now , i i i see the the <unk> .
i see the <unk> . .
so , quite exciting processes that then in this , , , , , , you don &apos;t actually , but here &apos;s in this in this <unk> mass .
anybody know what what three seconds ?
long , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know as a designer .
if i know something , three seconds , until i i sort of the present , i can i can see very very <unk> , i i i &apos;m by by by the three seconds of this .
it &apos;s only to process it as a present .
then then moves into the past , and so i can <unk> very elegant <unk> , for example , the computer , i know that phenomenon .
what takes <unk> milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time that you in love .
that means , , , if you know that , you you you , you look at how long because i don &apos;t have a <unk> for for what &apos;s going on .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the most of that that we have .
that means that first impact is happening in a fast fast whole way we see things .
and as we see things we &apos;re looking at what we &apos;re going and how we we also to the environment , our environment , so we can think of it .
of course , the the is not just with the of perceptions and neural neural <unk> or <unk> , but of course , with the subject of the <unk> .
so , a human with a certain things .
there &apos;s a practical functions of the the , so <unk> aspects or more <unk> aspects .
there are <unk> , where i know exactly where i have to to pick up .
there are there there is there , there is a a little <unk> , , where there was no , , , , , money money money money money money , , even it doesn &apos;t &apos;t it
we &apos;re more more in the <unk> , , the the of of the we we as a of of course ,
back to my actual subject of natural user , interface and the theme , which is of course , is <unk> .
<unk> , , , how can i can achieve a much , or can can be a a a in a particular <unk> of in a certain , efficient , efficient and <unk> .
that &apos;s what &apos;s the norm says the &apos;s .
how can i do something a little bit of ?
can i use it directly , or i need i need it , i say , i really say , an <unk> training training .
and fewer <unk> or or <unk> it &apos;s it .
that i just do this different different and beautiful , isn &apos;t that it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that .
and then if you think think in part of the software that we &apos;ve seen , , you you also understand why <unk> percent of our software is a lot of , or <unk> , , , , , , , , , , , , as a classic software .
and the intuitive <unk> isn &apos;t only been a a of a <unk> , , <unk> , , , , when i want to to to the technology .
why ?
because in the , we have in this new kind of <unk> , , which is natural user , , , times faster faster on our our our goal .
you have to imagine that if you make something the classical <unk> , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , just one an hour .
it doesn &apos;t mean they probably probably get four hours to home , but you have , , , you have , , as he &apos;d been with with the four hours .
but i want to say that it &apos;s a a of of of of of , , , of things that are .
if we go into the the of the software , the the first <unk> line of the that were very abstract , where you needed to to to with these systems .
then the next , , the , now , <unk> or mental model , the software , , , , , you have been a idea of something , the metaphor metaphor metaphor metaphor metaphor to make the computer .
so no longer have zeros and ones or <unk> code , but it &apos;s a metaphor .
this is a lot of <unk> , , but , but of course , much better .
the next generation generation of <unk> <unk> is working much more with behavior .
so i i &apos;m as a a a a lot of , a lot of that look like that .
this is also a paradigm shift .
i &apos;m that that that that that that that that that the success is the <unk> .
and then , if i put into a step into these natural user , where i &apos;m in in , by language , by , , by the , and and and and and and , and , and , and i &apos;m still more faster and and
but that leads me to the point , when will things be more intuitive ?
if you &apos;re using intuitive , and then i have to get my little friend in the <unk> and look , what does that look at the , of the , , when is is now something that &apos;s so
and that &apos;s is to us , it &apos;s always a , , , if i have to think about it .
so , didn &apos;t want to to to , but it just just to do it .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
that means , if we look at the existing <unk> of on a something different , for example , the metaphor , i can do it on it as a .
that means i can actually put an intuitive , , human <unk> of a software , and the software to the software .
so , of course , the question , what is the most <unk> of of us people and and now i &apos;ve it .
this is what so-called <unk> . .
this is using all of us and <unk> is an acronym and and for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
that &apos;s what &apos;s power of them all the time , but it &apos;s <unk> and and and and and and , and , and .
the model is already <unk> in in the womb and the is is , it works in the world , and old , and old , and it &apos;s used all the time , without most most that that the most of that that this model is there
<unk> <unk> is about 50 to <unk> , , of us , the , , , in the sleep , you &apos;ve found it &apos;s less than than than a day .
now i can now get this mental <unk> , , , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on a <unk> .
and through this kind of transmission , like the metaphor of the <unk> , now , but not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a a of a , a <unk> , a <unk> .
and this is on a higher grail of the <unk> as the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the the .
and when i &apos;m this this , , for example , i i <unk> as a as a , <unk> , <unk> , , it &apos;s get up to me , it &apos;s going to go on in detail , and i can go in the detail , or or or or or or or or or you can go to or or or
then i can the whole entire whole .
i &apos;m trying to do this through a <unk> .
and i have everybody , i have .
first : i i i to to the object , the object , again , <unk> .
i &apos;ll get the whole of of this , now can can and say , show me just just about chocolate for for example .
and once a interface , which is a more intuitive and much more natural .
because i can take things like the piece , and can can come up and come up to me is much natural natural , and , and other other mechanisms , can kind of kind of things to make things .
imagination is more <unk> <unk> <unk> , and with this sentence , i &apos;d like to close , a and again , also to give you a lot of , in the sense , and in in the sense , i &apos;m going to you a very , and please .
i want to give you a whole sense of curiosity .
the first thing when you &apos;re a child child as a child , as you know , you take what what , what what they have , , , and if their parents to play , , , , , , , , , , , of course , it &apos;s all . .
and curiosity doesn &apos;t learn to .
so &apos;s why all of those who are are and curious where people who have have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i now , it &apos;s this whole whole <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , 40 years to make it into quality .
and there &apos;s a central point .
and it &apos;s on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a a chance .
every day , they &apos;re about , any of any any of phosphorus , every day , they have to take two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
they can &apos;t have bone .
we could only do as <unk> <unk> through the <unk> . .
if we &apos;re no to go into phosphorus and and .
so , , it &apos;s that we &apos;ve been able to do with something that actually actually a an <unk> , but not not that .
because everyone talk about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the <unk> .
the <unk> is is a more critical .
we &apos;re on two countries .
we have only have for two years , and now , by the the world &apos;s <unk> in the world , the the the environment , as in all the <unk> .
in the last 20 years , <unk> tons of uranium in our fields in germany .
and we take this everything .
it &apos;s doing leukemia at children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little bit less . .
so for example , the environment , the environment , , less car .
<unk> the environment , do less waste .
<unk> the environment , the <unk> less energy .
but that &apos;s not a protection .
that &apos;s like if i say , <unk> your child , it it just three times times times five times five times .
this is just a little less . .
if we think from the <unk> to the <unk> , , our our entire earth , or later , a a <unk> .
and that &apos;s why the <unk> of the to think of the <unk> .
and the most important thing is looking at the ground as first first . first .
in the soil is <unk> in <unk> percent of the <unk> .
right now we we made corn and and , and <unk> and 30 pounds of 30 pounds per acres per square , or or the meter of the meter .
that means we &apos;re lose about five five times more than more as .
we can see of course , the the of of the .
and everything is is , or content .
in <unk> , for example , at the <unk> of the <unk> of the the <unk> .
and because we get older , it &apos;s the be the .
that &apos;s , you &apos;re , they &apos;re all in the <unk> . .
yes ?
a baby takes about thousand thousand .
we could be that of of 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is in in in in in a second .
that &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go with these <unk> ?
here &apos;s one of the way that that men are not pigs .
i tell you .
because the phosphorus will going to the the the the .
people the the the urine .
yes .
so so , you can &apos;t have a pigs .
because that &apos;s what it is , , right ?
traditional thinking think we think in the <unk> , we are too many in the world .
and when you do the people people people to be it , if you say that would be better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , they &apos;ll be <unk> and and .
and like someone says al gore , one of our large heroes , there &apos;s nothing to stabilize than human population population .
in israel , if you &apos;re a a population , you &apos;re going to do the earth .
here &apos;s , , you know , more you &apos;re , the more .
yes .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants had about four four four than than we people .
i i could also to to , , but in the united states , no , , seen as a , , even though they &apos;re a .
that means that ants had over a lot more than we .
and because they &apos;re much harder working than than we and because it &apos;s only three to six months , they are in your weight in your energy in the energy in the energy .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we are too stupid , right ?
and where you see how far we we really do , what we really wanted to do and how sad we we are , we can see , at the earth , you can see , for example , a program , to you to be , , , ?
you can only be <unk> , if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
have you seen a a a tree ?
yes ?
one single ?
that means our our intelligence means that we &apos;re going to be as as trees , yes ?
yes ?
no tree is <unk> .
fortunately , right ?
there &apos;s no <unk> at trees trees .
there are still billion billion trees in the . .
you &apos;ve heard about the <unk> of of trees ?
that means , our intelligence means that we want to be as as trees .
and where you see , even at something like , , the <unk> <unk> , , , no that that that our own <unk> .
every year , we &apos;re going to get three million tons of phosphorus that have to go back in the revolution .
and we are too many .
it alone .
so we we feel such as of the the we say , there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and they all the us , allow our to go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we are too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful to <unk> .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to restore our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about to have a big footprint , which is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the highest , not be there , right ?
<unk> , yes ?
you can only have <unk> when you &apos;re not there .
if you shoot it , they would have emissions .
so they can &apos;t even solve this .
we can do it differently .
we can get our nutrients .
we &apos;re in in agriculture in the we back to the .
we can actually go from this way in agriculture , in agriculture .
we do this in china , we &apos;re going to take the waste waste .
in china , a <unk> is called a <unk> , , , , , , , yes ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid , our nutrients .
that means that the entire western <unk> is is out that the city has always been , , but the farmers never been .
and it &apos;s to to the cities , the the , and the farmers were to the cities and the cities had to go over way to get their nutrients .
all of western western are always the , until they don &apos;t have more more the infrastructure and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done to <unk> civilization over five years , because you were able to the the nutrients .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat in china , you &apos;re to to the the food that they &apos;re as long until they &apos;re the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> to go and the the the .
you &apos;ve got to to eat them to eat , not to the <unk> .
that means you can see the the the the the the .
so , actually , beautiful thing is , when you do this , , , , , , on a five of , in in , , a a of a , a farmer , and and and and and and and and and and and and and fish .
and the great thing is that the the the in the favelas around over percent .
so we don &apos;t have to be people control , to be little bad .
we can support them , be good .
this is of course , , , , but the facilities are . themselves .
the is is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed designed , through design , that a farmer can just be .
that is , that &apos;s the back to the <unk> .
and no of these facilities , we &apos;ve built over the last 20 years , no of these <unk> has ever been <unk> .
you could just just a a a a a a a <unk> of a , and then the the changed the changed .
there &apos;s &apos;t mean .
that means we don &apos;t have to be people control , not to be bad .
we can support them , be good .
that means we need to be phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what , they write , in germany , in the best of the the the the of the the .
unfortunately , not in <unk> , , but maybe you can help the <unk> a little bit of .
because the <unk> plant could be the the the phosphorus .
and it &apos;s got to go back .
we see that that &apos;s really critical critical .
and we see that it &apos;s absolutely . .
we &apos;ve been used in in now over the . .
the the government has explained , they will be the first country the world the world .
but we need the of the . .
you know , there are two countries that almost <unk> 10 percent of the world &apos;s world .
there &apos;s a a of a a of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries , the 40 percent of the <unk> control .
and the oil will replace able to replace through other . .
but the phosphorus will not replace .
that &apos;s why not about making the existing existing a little bit less bad , it &apos;s about doing something right .
and is especially especially questions of what the right thing is .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency efficiency not about efficiency .
in in , , of course , it &apos;s easier because in holland , the country is on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if for example , if your your your woman is sad if you have them , and they come to to 50 . .
totally inefficient .
but actually , , yes ?
or take a <unk> . .
a woman in germany now eat six three of three pounds of their life .
it .
that &apos;s not exactly exactly , because because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> is going to be .
but a <unk> , even at this lighting , i can tell you is completely inefficient , but actually effective , yes ?
it &apos;s a of the life is not efficient .
not rather efficiency resource resource , but efficiency .
ask , what is the right ?
not , not to burn the <unk> to a little more and and and and and to the the the the materials for the trials , but first to ask , how do you
so , , , on the . .
yes ?
if i i go to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a a with a and and a glass of water .
wonderful , you know ?
this is efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love in love , efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything that matters is not to saving , to to .
the whole <unk> . .
we say the people , oh yes , you don &apos;t have a green of green in the south .
no , it throw out the right right , right ?
at every point where you &apos;re <unk> , , , , , , again .
but the wrong things .
if you <unk> the wrong things , you have a <unk> .
in how we think from north .
there &apos;s every footprint of the . .
if you walk , yes , every footprint the the ground .
because the the ground will going to die the and and the wind and the water is the the floor .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means that the water is there in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about create a big footprint that is a a .
not <unk> .
we &apos;re in in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask them , how do you you with her wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
i i say , <unk> <unk> , , yes ?
this is just the the .
so not saving , whatever , avoid .
everybody waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a master , when you see in italy , like people in the high , , can be from the car ,
because you know , this is a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a matter of <unk> , , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the the design , please .
so we &apos;ve developed a <unk> system , , it &apos;s an <unk> temperature in the room .
they can go up where they go and stand .
in two hours , they , everywhere .
and it contains seeds from rare plants , so that they &apos;re it through diversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so it &apos;s two two together .
it &apos;s not to be be <unk> .
a television or a washing machine , they use them , they &apos;re not use .
just the things that the <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , that have to be in biological systems .
the things that are only used to be in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the <unk> , , yes ?
and , , , , and not for the company <unk> <unk> , , but for that that this companies that this companies to make this this .
because we don &apos;t make the things from .
yes ?
so , when i put them up to food and say , this is <unk> of <unk> , they will not help you .
no , we &apos;re what what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like <unk> .
not &apos;s not toxic .
it &apos;s all , is useful .
so that &apos;s the first shoes that can you can the the <unk> of the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> in biological , , yes ?
everything is <unk> of it .
and if we get , , of course , we &apos;re going to do for for , for for , for <unk> and <unk> and the entire <unk> .
and that &apos;s half of all the the world that are caused by the industry .
so why they &apos;re doing with , ask , ask people people .
hey , <unk> , , are you really really ? ?
because they already have twice the the .
and i &apos;m not sure sure it really <unk> .
so , help me a little bit .
but it &apos;s going .
yes .
what &apos;s just shown is .
that &apos;s going .
we can do things now , if you &apos;re <unk> , if you &apos;re <unk> , you can in biological . .
i have the the of the the same .
there &apos;s this a direct <unk> .
this is the first ecological backpack , actually actually made for the in the cycle .
so also , in any store , you can the things .
if you come to that , yes ?
do you remember the the ?
if if you &apos;re at the point .
all those these of , around , almost almost .
in the countries where people people come to money .
there on the <unk> , , but also in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastic so that it can go in biological systems , if we change the the , inside , you can be back to <unk> , you can in in in israel , in in , in in , in , in , , trees .
yes ?
if you take these these , , they &apos;re <unk> , <unk> and and the the and to to plants .
so that &apos;s the baby for the whole life , the whole life ,
so we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s sort of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yes , of kind .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can even invent it .
i created a institute institute .
now , many people working on , and they can all bring them .
there &apos;s a a group car , , where everybody can be . .
so no longer save , , , control , reduce , not , , , , , , , , , , .
does it do that curious ?
thank you .
the work of the . .
music as language .
in the description to my speech , wrote that i was as a <unk> , , , , in the english , , , .
<unk> are <unk> of the written notes in <unk> music .
that you &apos;re not just a a for a word for text to the text in another language , but also the the deeper sense of words and <unk> , to understand a good translation , anyone who &apos;s to do with with . .
translate out into the english , , can know more know , it &apos;s when you &apos;re about , , , and it &apos;s about poetry .
but from is nature , but it &apos;s <unk> , what we do with our <unk> .
as a <unk> , i just first first first first first first first .
you &apos;re sure that the the the the the the the the the , , what he has he he .
in fact , the notes are very <unk> and <unk> .
these notes are about just as just as or or , like a a , , as also , very seemingly <unk> , , an basic . .
because in this <unk> <unk> , the smell of the flowers , the , the the of the the , just to the the of the <unk> , not not not not not not not not to .
that means that the to be this <unk> data of the in one , which is <unk> , concrete , <unk> <unk> .
today i want to to you what i &apos;ve to , , , , , , a <unk> language .
so basically a translation translation translation . translation .
so i i it to to do the all of german , because if i &apos;d to to into english , , it would be to to to the translation translation of translation . translation . translation .
so that &apos;s the music works for me as the spoken like the spoken language .
the <unk> notes have the function of the of one .
so it &apos;s not going to to to read reading and and to to the on the piano , or the right place on a <unk> . .
and that is just the letters that you learned to paint .
you can see the of the you you you can even be the language .
so , you need to to the the of the music for the for the for the like the .
and then there &apos;s also <unk> whether whether you learn it to the the , , can understand , or you can also talk to , until the the the .
the work of the <unk> starts to the the of a <unk> .
and you you a a piece of you , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re going to of the of of the of the composition .
you &apos;re information information about the piece of the .
you read read the letters , <unk> , , , , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts out of composers .
you studied the work that he and after after after .
you &apos;re comparison .
the <unk> to write it .
what did he do ?
like were his life of the , like the society and politics politics ?
all all interested in .
you think in this in this time , also <unk> images images , , , , , as well as
but , as a as a , , as a as an as a , to the composers that you play more times more times , and it &apos;s always easier to to it in and feel it .
the the is is more to to friend , which you have together .
his cause to write the piece , and more and more and more and more to my personal cause , play it .
now , the notes are the the the of the the of the , , but i think , a framework , i now now this framework to make it and meaning .
i i say , my own words , what could be written between this framework .
i play , i play , what these sound would have .
now for me and for today , and what you could mean today .
every sound , every phrase , a a sense that because i feel it because because it because it &apos;s from my my .
it must be to me in and now , , , i can &apos;t convince my audience that that &apos;s my cause .
it &apos;s always a a very happy concert again , i can get the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been in in the , , , how to experience .
how you &apos;ve been a happy new day , even even even even even the same rituals of life , get up , get up , and , , , , , i , i the same thing to the new .
i &apos;ve become a a day that seasons , my after my pulse theory goes down at the morning , a a , it it it it it it it it to come back to the .
i take the the of the audience , , , or <unk> .
and all that influenced me and and all that experience , my experience with the composition .
it &apos;s also very , when i &apos;m standing on the stage stage , and we have the same wavelength .
and then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
you make a new idea in and and then it &apos;ll that answer with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things things we &apos;re not going to have , and what you can &apos;t do .
it &apos;s great fun to make music music , and they as the audience , the the the music is to .
so every concert is a different concert .
i will never play more like this , as this moment .
i can &apos;t play as as as as in 20 years .
and i &apos;m going to have more more <unk> than today , and i &apos;m going to see my <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , more more emotions , emotions and emotion today .
sure , i &apos;m also going to have some <unk> of <unk> , but for new <unk> .
i have a very example of this .
it was on a <unk> <unk> for <unk> , my my , , professor <unk> <unk> , a known <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> professor of the <unk> in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so he was been <unk> when i finally started study .
but i had great lucky to get him , , , , , , and i was to to get my high school to my high school .
i was 17 at the time , when i was on a of his classes and playing the last four four of the four four of of , , a <unk> .
he asked me what the introduction of this <unk> is for me .
this is such a <unk> part .
and in my <unk> , i said , &quot; .
and he he , he said , , ?
it needs to be the <unk> .
because it means you memory .
he was already about <unk> .
well , with 17 , you have only dreams , but not a year .
i play the all the time , and it &apos;s been , and it has been , for me , though it &apos;s not a single note
every time it &apos;s exciting , over again , i read something new .
one of a a different area , and , the <unk> <unk> made the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but it &apos;s to different <unk> , , light light .
he &apos;s translated the <unk> <unk> , , as he saw it , as you look at it .
his personal <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of a piece is that to .
now , i also also also older as a when he was a <unk> , as he wrote the piece .
he was only living in the . .
and it &apos;s important to to me over and and , even when i &apos;m to them .
to keep the , , , with composers .
because the notes are the only connection to it directly .
especially if it &apos;s died before .
now , how do you start to talk the language of music ?
i said , yes , you have to be about for the like the spoken language .
and often the the is the the the the to learn the notes .
you learn to get to the before you &apos;re just one word word .
you learn to find the notes on the notes on the . .
if all the fingers 20 and right on the the , the notes , come come out , come and come out who sound sound like music .
if the &apos;s the , the students gets the <unk> piece of .
because of interpretation is hardly been talking about the .
well , there &apos;s the front of the , , , that &apos;s a quick piece .
<unk> , slowly .
according to <unk> , and and and b , etc . .
most of that know most .
but even if you put that data , it &apos;s still a little bit technical .
and still still , it &apos;s not interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you &apos;re a bit of <unk> <unk> .
because , to make music on the instrument that can do their musical and feel that should be . .
because that &apos;s what singing .
a kid who don &apos;t sing that because it doesn &apos;t have the parents , it &apos;s not going to do it .
this is like <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have his own experiences and and idea of music , then it another possibility to get a a a an an an an an an an an instrument to make .
people who never have out , never felt a with your own body , how it &apos;s to make a sound .
a phrase phrase with his own breath .
the the is the the of of our body .
we we to singing , the we , and their hands and and feet .
so the the the the the the the the sequel of my fingers .
the tune comes out of the <unk> and the rhythm of the dance .
the <unk> <unk> today is not <unk> today .
you don &apos;t need to make any more than it &apos;s going to be .
no longer needed to <unk> a <unk> , or sing .
each own music is <unk> when you walk out of the outside of music .
sure , there &apos;s some of you who say , , yes , but what do you do if if i can &apos;t sing ?
i , i can &apos;t , you can &apos;t sing , a , because you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they don &apos;t learned to sing ?
in both of the , not too late to to to to see if you can &apos;t learn , to learn how to get these little muscles that <unk> the <unk> , right .
which is to train .
or c , because you have them <unk> that they &apos;re <unk> .
i i question , how <unk> was was this diagnosis ?
have you just a a <unk> or a <unk> , how do you say it this days ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music music and and they don &apos;t want to have to do .
but what i i i was , , because music is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can be even more <unk> .
well , you can see , all all the cases has to be a <unk> candidate .
but don &apos;t tell you , i don &apos;t understand anything about classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
i i say , but i can say , you you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says , i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s me because i can &apos;t cook .
so , you don &apos;t give the food , because they can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to get over classical music , because because it doesn &apos;t play an instrument .
listen to and say you &apos;re not them or not .
whether the music is to to or to it &apos;s too sweet .
tell what they feel .
and you also get killing and and and , and a little bit more bit more bit more , or taste more good .
why am i challenge by my audience now that it whether it whether it whether ?
because the music is a language language language is a language to communicate .
a of of the you never never look at it has no force .
the food that that from a chef , a chef , a a a , has to be eaten and not just looked at or or . .
so , you hear you if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
if in a environment , the adults are active music or at least active music , a child , , it &apos;s a a to a a , , , , which color is your flower ?
can you play them in blue blue ?
and the child plays , after a a , , , there &apos;s a a a a a a blue flower .
and this sounds very different than before .
and that was the first first very first of of the own musical expression .
so the first step to an interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece of today , it was a hundred hundred , or three years ago , it &apos;s been written ?
and the instruments have the .
there was a <unk> as a instrument , as a instrument .
it wasn &apos;t invented yet .
i think the was got to be got to be the the of the modern <unk> of modern <unk> .
i can see the <unk> that that the stream is to to the the of the , which is a <unk> <unk> .
again , beethoven knows that he was that he he had been deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything , which has a orchestra of the time .
so , composers depend on us on us who are the pieces .
so they &apos;re being <unk> , what they just have in the spirit .
and also what they would think about in the mind .
or what i &apos;m going to do today , because what you might have thought .
thank you .
do you know what &apos;s is ?
were you <unk> ?
and how did that feel ?
so .
i got a friend who &apos;s come a <unk> .
when i come to my my my , , , , and my my my , , and i go to this feeling .
i took a little bit through the head .
i say , , , , what do you need to be big car ?
that &apos;s already seen that in the first year half half of his value .
and at all , you work much less than i .
why do i afford to afford this n ?
and then immediately , me , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this feeling feeling feeling .
our organism has invented a great method to make these of emotions like disappear just go away .
you can also try that with words like or or or or like .
i i want to explain to you a little bit of this , or something that you &apos;re familiar about .
the mechanism is from from the lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lie , you you might have heard , if people say , no one has to to the the wall .
and then <unk> rocks , so he &apos;s them them the view .
on one of you , you can see that the the itself doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
it makes a <unk> to that that it has a very sense .
he doesn &apos;t say , , , , .
no , the lie that i talk about , which is to do that , that .
they need this lie to get a <unk> to to get a <unk> .
they can make you less easy , , , or , or to the .
you need time .
from that time , one of the that you might know .
the spanish painter <unk> picasso has a woman a woman .
this woman has <unk> , the portrait wouldn &apos;t be to see her .
picasso , , wait for .
it &apos;s always going to them similar .
at this point , and when you laugh , you realize how important this lie is and how much time you need to to something that artists can tell us .
because artists have a <unk> ratio to lie .
the artist shares you , and especially of this lady , which they don &apos;t see if they just look in the mirror .
the artists , you in a such portrait , something that they &apos;re going to be familiar with this piece of works .
then this awkward feeling , it can &apos;t see you , , and it will always similar to them .
here you have this mechanism that we can use the lie as a great invention to our our of our our . .
and not only in art , in the , in the mythology , in the mythology , it comes back .
you might know this idea of the lady that looked at every morning in the the the mirror , and he asked him who is the most most most
one day , this mirror says , , , there &apos;s a <unk> . .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much of the true of this true tells you the mirror , is &apos;t lie , from this true full of . .
but we should just do familiar with that that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a <unk> somewhere else .
here &apos;s needed it , what we can understand <unk> <unk> , over again .
we need this this lie that that that <unk> us that we can &apos;t even live .
we don &apos;t just have in art , in the , , but in science , in science science .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s <unk> .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the of of species and the of of the people .
that the person should be from by the monkeys , , yes , there are a common ancestors between people and monkeys .
and then she ran her her her husband and said that , that &apos;s probably &apos;t think what charles said .
the person should have from the monkeys , or a common ancestors .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , we have to prevent people people get people from it .
why do we need to prevent people people people people come from something that if it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live without these <unk> .
because we feel this this , this feeling , great , , of the highest creatures , not from a <unk> , of such a organism that exists to a , , it &apos;s to to a stone and otherwise things that is for us .
so , we can &apos;t even do these things .
we need to prevent people people people people people about things , especially if they &apos;re true .
so you can see how they &apos;re going to and and and like the traces that that that that to to that is to to that a a picture of ourselves , , i want to give you another story .
a particularly nice story , i &apos;m .
my wife told me .
she came from one day , she she &apos;s teacher , and she told a student .
a <unk> student .
she likes to say it especially because he has an tendency to the . .
and she asked him , what are your own ? ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m in the fire fire .
and because i &apos;m in the fire , i &apos;m interested in <unk> .
yes , you feel it if you &apos;re <unk> on this point . there &apos;s something .
i i told my wife , always when a human in a moral <unk> , the <unk> , , we should try to replace it through the .
they &apos;re doing that , and then they want to get the sentence .
although i &apos;m in the fire , i &apos;m interested in <unk> .
you feel , that &apos;s the real truth behind the us .
this is a little <unk> , that doesn &apos;t really interested in the .
the &apos;s interested in the .
but there are no clubs that we can look at where we learn where to learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second second , , the fire fire .
there &apos;s called up . .
and <unk> , you &apos;re not saying to say that you &apos;d like to put in , and and when when the fire after after .
no , it just looks much better if we show that we we have in the to the the the the other , if they put out .
here you have this little mechanism .
this this <unk> that that that in the <unk> of the <unk> , , he was really related to the fire , but he can &apos;t say that .
here you have this <unk> <unk> between the the and the , the the , , , , you can do something about it , and the things that they know that they &apos;re going to be , so that they can better better better for them .
so then , just this kind of words that we we also use in language language right now .
we actually know that something else is the case .
but we know if we call this , the social <unk> is very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible , these things things in a society that to to to .
so i want to to give you what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
after what logic of this , , , , , , a different reality , which we actually know in the in the , that it &apos;s been no , to spread out outside .
i want to to give you two , maybe three examples .
the first example of what many of you know , and some of you will say , very few not need not need . .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is so mental , , says about about .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not <unk> , nature nature nature .
and if you have people who are a of belief that they have a soul , or you can say that they have been <unk> to life , the the , , , , , , , , , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
and from this soul , you think that they somehow in in this nature nature , in nature , in <unk> , it &apos;s in the latin , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and if this <unk> <unk> then , the people , , it &apos;s with with , with with nature , which only life life , , , .
and then he can <unk> .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul .
so it &apos;s to get up from outside the outside .
so we should be able to perceive it as something that &apos;s really to to your life .
and if you have this this , , you know , the logic that we can experience this happiness through a lie to improve our world .
because now you can use a <unk> . .
<unk> you know still have from school .
now this is a <unk> system that that that a logic .
that &apos;s the most part part in my talk .
here &apos;s what you should , , but also the to to lie .
and that is that they can just just wrong wrong .
in this <unk> , , three sentences .
the first sentence is , <unk> , , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if <unk> has , , he doesn &apos;t have soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i &apos;ve got it in front . .
a third sentence that comes to to people who have a strong feeling of soul .
the say who isn &apos;t a soul , which is dead , and can &apos;t actually say anything .
and here &apos;s you feel it .
this is this logic in this , , , in this <unk> speech .
you can see it immediately .
the first two sentences that are logical .
because i can tell it .
the logic doesn &apos;t want to tell you about the reality .
i can say the <unk> is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the <unk> is a man .
if i don &apos;t right , the the is is not a man .
the logic does not make any statement about what is true .
i can argue everything .
but critical is , when i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so when <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul .
second second , when he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have soul .
these things are logical .
and now our <unk> &apos;s ourselves , , , you can do something .
it &apos;s a a a a a that &apos;s nothing to do with the first two sentences , does it as the opposite of the first sentence has already proven and long .
because actually , we would have to prove if it &apos;s the soul or not .
but with that logic that it does just use that two sentences are accurate , and a third <unk> that looks like it would be something that it , it could do something with it , we can save our <unk>
so , we &apos;re like it &apos;s impossible impossible to be able to live without an soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things things things different examples .
in the present , we have a a very modern example , which is over and over again .
this is to to to another <unk> subject , a <unk> of of philosophy ,
so this has to do that we back back to the <unk> century .
there was a scholars who was called the and and after the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> that &apos;s from of nature .
it &apos;s not the soul .
this is such a <unk> . .
and if you put the exactly the in the middle between two <unk> <unk> , , then he <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what what to to to to .
so he &apos;s exactly in the middle .
this is the the <unk> .
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> with each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
and if you take another example , so if you immediately power the a , , it , it doesn &apos;t need any reason , and nothing .
automatically he out to right thought .
if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of driven in nature , is a <unk> , , the the of the , that you , you you , you you &apos;re also going to feel like that there &apos;s
and if we &apos;re in in <unk> , , , i remember the the of of the .
there &apos;s a scholars who is called wolf , and and he says to it , , , , , , , there &apos;s no <unk> . .
now we can can can make the second sentence and and can say when wolf is right , he &apos;s no <unk> .
these are are quite logical and correct .
and what we &apos;re now going to read in the daily day in the in the , , it &apos;s in this third sentence .
it looks like this , who doesn &apos;t have <unk> , , not can &apos;t be to for for action and claims to responsibility to responsibility , and he &apos;s <unk> .
again , they have it again .
actually , you would be to prove if there &apos;s something like <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do as as the first sentence of the first set of the wrong wrong , , you would think of of of the .
and now you can just , if you want to do anything anything , if you want anything anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , to to the next to lie .
practice that for example , if you can see a people , you can tell you , there &apos;s no <unk> . .
and please don &apos;t use the german war for <unk> , which is called the .
and you don &apos;t tell you that that would be a little bit more political .
you , there &apos;s no <unk> . .
immediately immediately , you &apos;re going to be that for granted , of , , you can &apos;t prove .
and you have a problem .
because as they are busy with that , that they can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no <unk> , , is a happy .
he &apos;s quite happy about it because he &apos;s it .
because he took it on a <unk> , he he doesn &apos;t get out itself .
because actually , this is not interested in in .
it &apos;s just interested in the , of the need to to prove that there &apos;s <unk> .
so , in the of the shift of the <unk> , the the of the lie .
and if you &apos;re able to have a way to feel that <unk> of , people , they do it , because they &apos;re going to be happy , if you don &apos;t remember it in this way .
thank you for your attention .
yes , good day .
i &apos;ve allowed to ask me whether i can say to say .
it &apos;s one of the <unk> <unk> here here , this great event , and i asked me if i &apos;m want to hold a talk here and i &apos;ve my idea .
i have to say , you &apos;ve got it to , it i started to talk about my idea .
and i may be able to imagine my <unk> , i &apos;m trying to imagine .
but of course , it &apos;s the sum of the , very many ideas .
i probably probably probably the the two nice girls still there , i probably probably probably the generation that that for this bad image of because i &apos;ve been <unk> to study making a plastic in in , , , , , i think , .
and i &apos;m to me , the <unk> <unk> in berlin <unk> , because i was not to and and and there &apos;s &apos;t be in in <unk> .
there were the <unk> <unk> .
the the time , the <unk> , the <unk> was <unk> .
the called <unk> today .
because a good engineer has either designed great cars or or .
but something like like n , , from a hundreds of a hundreds of tiny meter out of the meter of the , that was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy <unk> .
i &apos;m grateful that that he he the word again again , because after the <unk> , you couldn &apos;t use the word more because everything was a good .
but that &apos;s not the the in the <unk> .
so there was was that there was a <unk> <unk> and and one of of the in in <unk> in the <unk> where you &apos;re doing evil . .
the place of the , , but it was called <unk> and and and and and and and i started to the the <unk> .
and yes , a lot of what it became today , touched me , very , many , many beautiful expressions of the that i &apos;ve also lived through .
i was working on the <unk> of the <unk> , that was <unk> .
we were twenty people .
if one one said no , the <unk> , , was a <unk> , i i i i i &apos;ve been a lot of years , i i really really my my great <unk> , , because , because all my colleagues had always <unk> him , you &apos;ve got the money on your child .
it &apos;s with . .
and that was really , very , , and you also come in in that , in , , a picture of a , , i was , , , , , , , , , of course , , , , that really the great thing to be .
and i got it to <unk> , and then we &apos;ve been with with friends , i have become a company of <unk> who were together with the <unk> <unk> of of the largest <unk> in the world .
and a a , , , but we , of course , we have a problem of a , and we have <unk> , a small group , decided to start to and and and , and i think , it &apos;s going to , the the , , that &apos;s not , we &apos;re not talking about it .
and i i i i to a a project i i want to imagine you .
and the title of talk was , yes , you get to a hundred renewable .
and we just have just a relatively a story of to questions , where where you could have a an an an with a memory .
on this island , this is the island of the <unk> .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
there will maybe a thousand thousand thousand people .
they have a renewable renewable <unk> of 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have ?
just don &apos;t just technological .
if you &apos;re more more <unk> each other , , it starts to fail .
i also always tell that the politicians when they put into our plant .
they always say , why ?
we &apos;ve had 20 percent in germany .
it can &apos;t be a problem .
but not , we have seven percent and our web is physically the european .
if we had had in europe , we have have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was was , , , this was <unk> , , the first of the the the the , , , , just just through .
how big should be a a battery , so you you have an an island , 30 , 30 , 40 , fifty , maybe , , , , ,
and yes , i &apos;ll going to go a <unk> . .
the conventional system looks like all around the world .
by the way , a a year , a a of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in the world .
that is the the of the of nuclear power power nuclear power , because it &apos;s particularly fast .
the the world &apos;s <unk> , is is , because because you have not to to .
that goes fast .
you can make an an box .
and then it looks like this .
in the always always the three of the <unk> , , , and i &apos;ve ever been waiting .
yes , this is a that &apos;s the the the the .
we &apos;ve also get very very data .
and the <unk> or or whatever it is , is a a a system is a a system , a system , which is a a in small couple of .
our goal was just to say , okay .
the the is is <unk> and the wind , sun sun , the the the the the the amount of whole .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewables , energy , energy a year , the performance , you have to turn off the the .
that is where you have to to to that , the renewables , the renewables can can to to over the web .
and of course , you can be , if you &apos;re going to be <unk> .
that &apos;s &apos;t actually like the world .
so that &apos;s in small style , so you can also can in your car on a small <unk> of .
people are always asking me what what do you <unk> in in the ?
it &apos;s already .
but if you want to <unk> several of these <unk> <unk> , and you should to build a net , it &apos;s very complicated .
and our goal was , we we to to to percent renewable and then there &apos;s the rest of the , the last , , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , , is going to be very , very , , and it doesn &apos;t make that that it made out of batteries .
it &apos;s going to be a energy energy , which is hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , it &apos;s be be .
they have to go to a <unk> and and and and <unk> and not just <unk> .
we just wanted to know what what is a normal , <unk> battery battery .
how far are you going to do ?
and then have a whole lot of of .
and have wind wind and sun and the and and the and and the the , , a very exciting outcome that you to the the the , , , a a , a a , a a , a , 50 cents a half a <unk> .
this was the first first calculations from six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper as the <unk> , when the <unk> is five percent a year .
and then we started to with with the <unk> . .
what should have to be done ?
have have investors , i &apos;d looking new new .
so , we were only five people to build into the society .
and here &apos;s the picture .
the brown is kind of the conventional the , the green is our system .
that our system also has a <unk> , because we &apos;re still there to be 20 percent of and and and and a <unk> on the other things .
and the <unk> that that the the the the island , the is , we find it really .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
and so we were to to a a hall in berlin where we can kind of the the of the the of the the of the the of the . .
that means we we looking looking for looking for the world &apos;s battery battery .
here it is .
it comes from asia , in the in the .
and <unk> , she <unk> in the &apos; 70s , in the &apos; 70s , <unk> , , and then got <unk> to the japanese .
it &apos;s a very , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it has a megawatts of power and you can make the performance and and that is the battery that we have kind of <unk> .
and then then put it .
we also have one of these <unk> in the same size , as he &apos;s there , the the the the the the of the net , so in the the , is the the , here is the the , here is the the of the that we we see the net .
so here we then simulate the whole <unk> , the the the of the cable , to the the the the net .
and here you can see this whole whole thing .
we can also <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the net .
here we see here here here here here here , here here , here here , here , here , here , the , , , the whole , , individual <unk> .
and what we &apos;ve done , since the <unk> was the the the the , , , all of the , , which is the individual system in electronics , to the , we &apos;ve done .
so we &apos;re not a <unk> , but we define us as a company that is just between the and the the of the and and everything in between .
you have to communicate to the battery , you &apos;re also to to communicate in the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beautiful thing is that the subject that you &apos;re basically in this island today , it &apos;s all the the of problems that we &apos;re going to get if we want to raise our levels of renewable renewable .
so this whole discussion , how is going to go back and <unk> , <unk> , , , , to the the island , we have to to to 30 percent of <unk> , , , we <unk> the wind and the sun .
<unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
so <unk> , a <unk> .
we can start to integrate the , , , , , , you can manage the burden .
that means when you &apos;re in 70 percent renewable , you you can &apos;t do it without memory .
you can <unk> <unk> , you can go through the nets , , , , you , you , you &apos;re doing , the the of the , , but you can &apos;t be fully complete on memory .
and that &apos;s such such of that message .
so , many people and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn off the the , you you have no longer the the of mass that creates a certain more prefrontal in the net .
and our <unk> <unk> is is basically only the <unk> of mass of <unk> , where the wave is all all over europe .
we look in this net , the 50 people , , and when it &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , , we &apos;ll start a a <unk> , , then a a little bit of a , , then we get back back .
this is the system .
and of course , this is incredibly amazing .
if you <unk> the somewhere , it &apos;s an .
the <unk> <unk> has at least 10 seconds to keep the net .
and in the time you can respond to .
if you don &apos;t have that , this , mass , then you have to replace it with <unk> and and .
and we can <unk> with this big battery .
you you see , which is what enormous <unk> of . .
and the message is , we need to get up to these <unk> masses , if we were to our our goals , 20 , 20 , 20 , twenty , 30 , 30 percent , and so on if we want
and then we have to break our <unk> capacity to the web .
<unk> is just called the power station to to the the frequency .
yes , it &apos;s a <unk> of the moment , the <unk> of the , because we don &apos;t have or or , because it &apos;s not .
and we &apos;re just trying to tell you that you can the capacity , the <unk> capacity , can can , by also by by the memory .
now , there is now a lot of studies .
and too , that &apos;s the people come and see , and look at our <unk> , , just like our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion is going to the question , how far , you can a a piece of a piece of
and many of i had in the last six years , the the the discussion i had in the the last 30 years .
it &apos;s not , , , , , we &apos;ve all all , , never &apos;t . .
we have <unk> <unk> <unk> in germany .
this is <unk> .
and i just go out that we have the same capacity in the the next 30 years , the the world &apos;s the .
simple , it &apos;s going to .
there &apos;s a whole lot of <unk> and and and .
the beautiful thing is that i &apos;ve seen in the last two years , the scientists have been to my side .
we &apos;ve got by ten million <unk> of , , and now to <unk> the <unk> of the german net .
that &apos;s going to be in the next april .
so , it &apos;s a that of that , there is a change , and it &apos;s just about this <unk> of , , to the , a hundred percent renewable is true .
and if you have a hundred renewable , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
now , far , we &apos;re trying to take , , these <unk> that , which have a a of a , that have a a small web web , that has nothing to do with our <unk>
the question is , really , if you &apos;re completely , , any of fossil fossil or <unk> <unk> , , the world , the world , they &apos;re going to be <unk> , they &apos;re a island
then you &apos;re just use the what &apos;s going on the sun and wind is where they live .
and this is such a little of vision of a <unk> energy energy , and i also also grateful that they said they have said , solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we do , and in in , in the , the talk of <unk> <unk> , that you can be a collective and use energy and use energy , here a little bit .
and i &apos;m well , i just want to encourage you you , in the sense that you can be a little bit crazy , and you can have a vision .
and you really have to get very <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going .
thank you .
when steve + , , of the los angeles times , one day , the the from the from the from los angeles , he he a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , homeless , who played on a violin that had only two . .
many of you will know the story story , because because of <unk> paper , was a book that was a book , was <unk> , , robert <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and the very career , and the very early career , early <unk> early on his early <unk> .
nathaniel left from , , a a , 30 years later , he was <unk> a homeless homeless in the the of the from los angeles .
i recommend telling you to read , or to the the movie , so it doesn &apos;t just understand the wonderful sign of the , which is , but also how the music that that that that that that that that allows the to get the <unk> , , from the street .
i i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in the disney , <unk> .
he &apos;d just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony and came behind the stage to me to me .
he was talking a very <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and and and clinton and and , how the dodgers would never create into the baseball world , and and all of the <unk> <unk> of the the of of fourth fourth symphony .
we came to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email that was was was was in <unk> .
i i &apos;ve got to mention that nathaniel because , because it was already with with with and and and and and <unk> , a trauma that has been him his whole life .
now , as a result , it &apos;s particularly vulnerable to these <unk> , they are sometimes so bad , and he goes away , and he &apos;s <unk> , in the streets of <unk> <unk> , , and the the and the the his own mind .
and in was in a <unk> , , , , we were in the the the disney disney , , and he had this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and and had lost .
he talked about invisible artificial and smoke and and and about how to make him in my sleep .
i was scared , not <unk> , but i was afraid that i could lose him , could be in in a states , and that i could destroy him to the violin , and i started to to the scale and and and other exciting forms of the <unk> .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s . .
and as i played , i was in a a of , , a a change .
it was like he was under the impact of a invisible of , a chemical reaction , that was my my game .
<unk> <unk> , , in understanding , in a <unk> curiosity and <unk> .
and as a miracle , he took his violin , and started to some of of the of of <unk> and asked me to play them , play , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we then started talking about music , started started talking about beethoven , , , , , and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> to <unk> .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t know a <unk> knowledge about music , but it it with with a close personal personal relationship .
he spoke about her with a passion and a understanding that i only know from my colleagues in the in los angeles .
by <unk> music and talking about music , was from this <unk> , , man who was spent by the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , , , , , , a musician .
music is medicine . music is changed .
for nathaniel , music is a health .
because the music allows him to do his thoughts and and with with the imagination and creativity and creativity .
and so he <unk> his <unk> states .
i understood that this is the the nature of art .
right is why why we make music why we we do this : so we &apos;re all in all , in , , our feelings , our artistic lens , by our creativity , to shape .
and the reality of that expression is us us , and and and and and and together .
and nathaniel <unk> , so it took him back into a community of friends .
the <unk> power of music took him back into a family of musicians , who made him his talent and <unk> it .
and i &apos;m going to get again again , <unk> , whether in the disney disney hall , or in <unk> , , because he reminds me why i become a musician .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you . thank you .
robert moog .
robert gupta : i want to play a little bit that i &apos;ve stolen the <unk> .
i hope you you me .
so i known known in my life .
i only loved two .
this first , that was more like a passionate about .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good , , , , , a <unk> on the . .
what a fish .
even better , it was been <unk> to <unk> <unk> of the of of sustainability .
so you could think of it , to sell it .
i had a relationship with with a different of months .
one day , the the company in the company , asked whether i could a case of a a on the sustainability .
&quot; of course &quot; i said .
here was a company to solve what what that this this really has become a problem for our our , how do we keep fish up to our ? ?
in the last 50 years we have the ocean we have the the , we &apos;ve been .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> destruction .
90 percent of the great fish that we love , the tuna , the <unk> , the <unk> , , , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost no more left .
so , probably , or <unk> , , , , part of our future .
many lot of arguments against it , <unk> <unk> the environment , most of you , , and they are inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
that is , 15 pounds of <unk> , so you you get an <unk> .
not very sustainable .
don &apos;t tastes very well .
so here was a company was to make it right .
i wanted to them .
the day before the event , i called the head of the <unk> for the company .
let &apos;s call call him don .
don &quot; don &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts , you &apos;re famous for to grow so far out of the sea that you don &apos;t <unk> the environment .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far out that waste is <unk> to our fish , not not focused . &quot;
and then he added , , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this <unk> of <unk> <unk> , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
<unk> is one , great .
&quot; <unk> to one ? what ? you ? ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable sustainable , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put it . .
and that evening , i was in bed , and i thought , what is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , the event , , , .
i said , &quot; don , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s going to .
well , i &apos;m a with a couple of people in the company , no one could give me a a a , until i finally , the <unk> city city .
we call it a don .
don &quot; don said , &quot; what are sustainable sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some of the , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , <unk> , skin , <unk> , , , and and food food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much of your <unk> is chicken ? &quot;
in the assumption , two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don , what is sustainable to feed chicken in fish ? &quot;
there was a long break in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i &apos;m from from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
i &apos;m even . .
no , i actually <unk> <unk> from this fish , because , because i swear to god , the fish called the fish after chicken .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way you you know , you know , you know , you know , you more more the fish more .
i first eaten him in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> journalist had been talking been talking about the fish .
it has a natural <unk> .
he came on the table with a bright , , <unk> white color .
the chef had <unk> him .
stop twice .
amazingly amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can make a fish so that , after he was <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can be it .
we call it <unk> . . actually he he &apos;s <unk> .
and no , he &apos;s not <unk> the fish , and it &apos;s not a chef , at least the way you you and i understand it .
he &apos;s a biologist in <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in in the <unk> corner .
it &apos;s close to the the of the river .
until the 1980s , farm was in the hands of <unk> .
they were <unk> <unk> on what was basically the .
they did that by the the land .
they built this complicated consequence of channels , and they were the water out of the land and out out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make that that worked , not no economic .
and it was a disaster .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds , which is a lot of birds .
and so 1982 launched a spanish company with the country .
what did you do ?
they have the river of the water .
they literally have the levers .
instead of the water water , they used the channels to the water .
they <unk> the . .
they created a <unk> acres of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- and and and and his company <unk> the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen this .
they &apos;re on on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see are <unk> channels and and density , a march march .
i was not a long time in the time .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and a a of a <unk> .
okay ? there we were and we we fighting the the the and and <unk> , , <unk> to my knees , and <unk> <unk> in a <unk> .
this is a rare <unk> . .
now he mentioned the <unk> of of .
and here , here he &apos;s a pattern of a pattern of motion that it &apos;s <unk> .
it turns out that <unk> , the most of of the career in the <unk> national park in africa .
i asked him to have a a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for for . . &quot;
and then he goes and <unk> to <unk> of rare birds and algae and <unk> .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community community , , like in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was love love
and my head became weak about this <unk> piece of <unk> that i had the the . .
so i name it . i said , &quot; <unk> , how does it look like this ? &quot;
he showed on the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the , , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what are your fish ?
what is the <unk> ? ? &quot;
well , he goes to me me that it &apos;s a a rich system is that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
the the of biomass , the the , the the , , which is what the fish .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
there &apos;s no food food .
the ever heard about a farm that don &apos;t that your animals ?
and later on the day , i went on on this site with <unk> and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be , , , , , than any farm i ever ever had , &quot; how do you buy
the moment , it was like a a a a a a a .
and we started to the the corner and the the incredible view , thousands and thousands of designers then <unk> , , a literally then , the the .
&quot; this is success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
they <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> the birds .
well , last year , over over over over over over over over 10 , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s the biggest biggest and one of the most important private <unk> in in europe .
i said , &quot; <unk> , is a good <unk> <unk> <unk> not the last last that you want to have a <unk> ? ? &quot;
he <unk> his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re build <unk> , not no .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the the .
the the the the the the the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink that . a farm that don &apos;t <unk> and and a farm that are their your success of your planning .
a <unk> , , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , that , should not be this <unk> of the first .
they &apos;re in in a city of <unk> miles away , where the <unk> is better for the .
every morning they they have increase to hundred miles .
and every night , they have <unk> kilometers .
they do that because they can follow the <unk> white line of the <unk> line .
seriously .
i had introduced a kind of the of penguins , so i looked at <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , , they send to to kilometers to the farm and then they ever ever ever back to ever ever back to ever ever
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me as i was just a song from the . .
he said , &quot; no . you do that , because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t want to mention the skin of my loved fish , the delicious , and i don &apos;t like a <unk> . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
i &apos;m almost never .
and yet , when i tried her in this restaurant in <unk> , , they didn &apos;t get <unk> .
she liked cute and and in it as if you take a a out of the ocean .
i mentioned to <unk> and he &apos;s <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a swam .
it &apos;s the last defense before until something into the body .
she &apos;s developed in the the of evolution , to <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he added , , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that don &apos;t <unk> the fish , a farm that are its success success success .
and then i realized , he says , he says , a farm that has no <unk> , , because the water that &apos;s through that that &apos;s comes from the river from the river . .
it &apos;s a river that leads to all of things that are rivers today , , , , , , chemical , , <unk> of <unk> .
and if it has them through the system , and this leaves that leaves water , as it &apos;s <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it clean the water .
so not just a farm that don &apos;t &apos;t , , not just a farm that &apos;s its your in health health of your predators , but a a farm , not just for these fish , but it &apos;s also for for you .
because when the water <unk> , it &apos;s in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and they should do , because this story , as , as is is also .
you might say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future , the future , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
now what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in fact , in the food actually really .
but for many people , this is a little bit radically .
we &apos;re not a <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re <unk> .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we &apos;re talking about food food . we &apos;re food food .
and if you say that that the things that the future is a to someone somewhere somewhere , and says , &quot; hey , people , i love <unk> <unk> , but how are they feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we &apos;re already be enough calories to feed the world more than than than than .
one billion people are going to . .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of the masses in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i don &apos;t like that question because it has the the of of the last 50 years .
and grain of <unk> , <unk> , , chemicals , chemicals on the earth , chicken , and the the time , just asked , &quot; if we make more people cheaper , how awful it be ? &quot;
that was the reason . it was the <unk> . it was the business business business business .
we should call them what it is , an using an using an using an , , which is <unk> <unk> capital , which allows this production .
it &apos;s not an using , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our <unk> is is is is not because of <unk> <unk> , but because of <unk> resources .
not by the <unk> and <unk> , but by through country , not through pump , but through fresh water , not by <unk> , but by <unk> and and , but by the and and , but through the sea .
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we make conditions to make any community to to to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the the for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are in and and it has never been making something really good for food .
so let &apos;s take the look at the ecological model .
this is that &apos;s to two billion years of <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
businesses that are not worlds for those are , , , , instead of the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , are are , , , but are are in , but , but in evolution for relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones that also experts experts .
and if i &apos;m honest , you &apos;re a better chef when i ever ever .
you know , this is really , because when the future is the , , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to see a is that is the the of of the data that we consume , bigger than the sum of their parts and instead of think about how we can to think about how we can be that , and we that that that that that that would &apos;t be visible .
so , what we see here is a typical <unk> of a .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter , a of of of , , we &apos;re . .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes it .
and that is because in the the , is the most are the most , and they &apos;re over there .
we can go out and go and and the data data , and then you see that <unk> and cancer is the usual , , not not for everybody .
now , if we go on on and , we we just say , 40 years or we , , that accidents actually actually the the the the people should worry about .
and who &apos;s the , that is is true with men .
so you can see that this is a <unk> of information and data in this in a living <unk> .
and if we can make this for raw raw , why not why ?
now what we &apos;ve now have the <unk> of of the <unk> &quot; <unk> that ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can like to test it in my <unk> .
with <unk> , you can stick into a decade .
you can an into a a a a .
you can jump directly to a particular copy .
now , i look at here , i see the athletes that the the that in this copy and the <unk> .
i &apos;m a <unk> armstrong fan , so i click over here i &apos;m to show you you in the armstrong .
now , if i just want to get a a of of , i i think , &quot; ok , what if i look at the subject of the ? &quot;
so i go back and and i &apos;m the the perspective .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea that if you you on this kind of information , <unk> , , larger , <unk> , , , , , you don &apos;t just look or or not just .
you &apos;re something something that &apos;s a little bit different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it change the way that can be used .
so i want to take this idea of a little further with about what &apos;s a bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here we &apos;ve got every single <unk> and and it up to a little up .
it &apos;s a a of of and and a symbol of the the of of .
i just just show the top 500 500 of the popular <unk> .
but even in this <unk> , we can do a lot of things .
so immediately , we get a sense of the themes that are on the the popular .
i &apos;m going to choose the subject .
now , after i i , i i , the the <unk> that the most <unk> of the the of the year .
this is really important , because this is a insight that doesn &apos;t in a single <unk> . .
this is just to see if you go back and and the whole whole thing .
i , a a of of a , i can go in the the of time , &quot; &quot; people in the year , and all of them together .
now , i &apos;m looking at all these people i &apos;m looking at all of these people , the majority of it are , and some of them come from science . some less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes
and interestingly , bono is a ted prize winner .
so we can jump forward and look at all the ted prize .
you see see , we &apos;re on the the the the first time if it &apos;s a is a network , not just from side , but a lot more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise could be .
i &apos;m just show you just the new york website website .
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really no browser , but you can look at on this -- and we &apos;re to the these <unk> of the every website like this .
so i can go back to a step , and take directly to a specific <unk> . .
that &apos;s because you only just by the on the way that the way that can the the same way that the same way that can see .
so i can zoom in in in a particular time time .
here &apos;s the the of the the of the that i &apos;ve been here .
and i can , i can , i i &apos;ve been looking at this , again , again .
and when i look back to a step and and , and i can see my my , i i can start my my , , i i , i i looking for &apos; <unk> , , here , , , , , live here .
and from here i can go into the side and go back and go back .
it &apos;s a metaphor that is used over again , and every time it makes it bigger bigger than the sum of the . .
now , in the world , we think that data is a <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about the <unk> of the .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning in &quot; &quot;
what if we can turn this situation and turn the internet on the head , so we can always go through one to the other , start to a lot of things things , and that can see patterns that would be on other other .
if we can do this , then this <unk> <unk> , , maybe a new source of information .
and instead of just just to move into information , we can know know .
and if we know know , we can even get <unk> from it .
so i i i , thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unk> portion of science fiction .
in my school , i went to the bus for every day hour every day .
and my nose would always put in a book , a <unk> , that my my mind in other worlds and and my my , my my , <unk> <unk> .
and that curiosity also that i i was not in school , through the forest , walking and , &quot; samples , , , , and and and and and and and and and and and and the the microscope .
i was been <unk> , , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and the the of of explore .
and my love love science fiction fiction was in my environment , because in the late &apos; 60s , we flew the moon and and the the deep sea .
jacques <unk> came into our living with his fascinating shows us animals and places and a world of a of we we we could never have before .
it &apos;s probably been good to the <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and because of games games , not the video games of video games , the all the the the the the the the media environment , i had to get the pictures in my head .
we had to all that time , when we read a children , we took the the description of the <unk> and and they them on the the on our heads .
my reaction was to draw , paint , aliens worlds , land , robots , and all of .
in the <unk> , i was the the of the , i was hiding in the textbook , <unk> .
creativity had to have gone out .
and something interesting interesting thing interesting thing interesting thing , which was fascinated to jacques <unk> shows , was the thought of a <unk> world on earth is on earth .
i certainly certainly never going to get a alien world with a space , that seemed pretty unlikely .
but here was a world that i actually just to into the earth , and it was just fascinating and and as the , of what i &apos;d always been i i had read that books .
so i decided to be , when i was 15 to be diver .
the only problem that i was living in a small village in canada , a 1,000 miles away from the next ocean .
but i didn &apos;t let me get .
i i my father , until finally , he finally a a <unk> in in , new york , , , on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i was my <unk> in a pool of the in the in the in the in the in the in new york .
but the ocean , , a real ocean , i got to get two years later , when we moved to california .
since the years , in the 40 years , now , i &apos;ve spent about , , , have spent several hours of it in <unk> .
and i learned that the world of the sea , even in the <unk> oceans , the ocean of the ocean , as as as we can can &apos;t really be able to imagine .
the imagination of nature knows not a boundaries , in as as our own , human imagination .
until today , i i i have a as awe for what i see in my my .
and my love itself to the ocean , the same intensity as ever ever and ever .
when i was a a a a , , it was the . .
it seemed the best way to tell my inner to to tell stories , with my need to to , to .
and as a kid , i drew the and and so .
so films were the to lose images and and stories together . that fit together .
of course , the stories that i <unk> , from the <unk> , &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; aliens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot;
in &quot; <unk> , i was able to <unk> my own for the <unk> and and the the the .
so , the other kind of <unk> , my two passions .
something interesting happened happened in &quot; <unk> : to solve a problem problem in this film -- and we had to make a kind of liquid liquid <unk> -- we we on <unk> animation , <unk> , , back .
what came out up , the first <unk> <unk> <unk> that was ever in a movie .
it &apos;s not a money , he was said , he was just playing his own costs , but i realized something fascinating : the audience in the world , the the magic that came from .
all , arthur clarke &apos;s law is maybe technology technology and and to even to from another .
so they saw something magic .
and that &apos;s what i thought was really exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , it &apos;s be involved in the the . . &quot;
so we went in &quot; in , , , &quot; my next movie , even further .
and with with <unk> , we created the guys of liquid metal , and success was on the way that would come .
and it worked . again , we created something more magical , and the effect in the audience was the same . but we we &apos;ve got a little more money .
and from those two experiences , a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity .
so i started a company , with my my my friend , , , who was the best <unk> and <unk> , and she was called &quot; digital <unk> . &quot;
the basic idea of this company was that the phase of processes that have to <unk> and and and and and and with digital digital <unk> .
we also did this , and we us a a for a time .
but the middle of the 1990s , we realized that we were in the and and and -- and what we actually started the company , , to slow .
i had this piece of &quot; called &quot; that the the the the in visual effects and <unk> effects , to , with , , , , , who were using <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> should be all the <unk> . and the world should be <unk> .
but the the put it back . and people in my company , told me that we don &apos;t be able to be able to do that .
so i i it this and i made this other film about the big ship that will go .
i &apos;ve got this as &quot; &quot; and and and a a ship , &quot; it was a <unk> of of , , a a .
but , i wanted to <unk> the the the the the titanic .
so , i did the movie .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
i i convinced you , by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to the the . we &apos;re the the the .
we &apos;re going to show it in the <unk> of of the movie .
that &apos;s incredibly important . it &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing for marketing . &quot;
and i started to to to a expedition .
sounds crazy . but it goes back to that that can can can can can make an reality .
we actually created six months later , a reality , i in a a russian <unk> <unk> , , four miles miles of the north atlantic , and i &apos;m looking at the real titanic through a <unk> . .
it wasn &apos;t a movie , no <unk> , that was really .
so , that really really my mind .
and the <unk> of the were enormous . we had to put cameras and and and and and all the possible .
and i was on , how much this <unk> , , a <unk> . .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
you get up in this , you you &apos;re in to this dark environment , down , where there &apos;s no hope of you , if you don &apos;t get it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just like i was in a <unk> .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with the deep sea .
anyway , the part of what , and science and science . it was it was it was adventure . it was a . . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that i could not give hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine an creature that we could make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t think of what i would would be outside of the . .
at some of the following , , i saw creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve seen before , sometimes , that , even seen the time , and for the time we saw them , even no one .
so that &apos;s me <unk> me , and i wanted to get more .
and so i was a something something like that .
i was the success of the titanic &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> in hollywood in hollywood , and i &apos;m going to be a for for a while . &quot;
and then we started we started to the the <unk> , , and they were in <unk> .
we went to the the the titanic .
we took little robots that we built that a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> , and the the of the ship , which was never been done before .
no one had the the inside the body of the , and you had no means for it . so we developed the technology .
and i &apos;m sitting on the the of the titanic , in a <unk> , , and see see , that that <unk> that this <unk> , and i i know that once there was once played there .
and i &apos;m going to a a little <unk> through the <unk> of the ship .
i &apos;m actually it it , but i think , but my consciousness is in the vehicle .
it felt like , as i was physically in the the of the titanic .
this was the <unk> form of a <unk> that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i i a corner of a , i always knew what was going on the the of of the vehicle , i had had had to be a movie of the .
and the set was a very of of the the of the ship .
so this was a very strange experience .
she was realize that this <unk> that that you can use such <unk> <unk> , and so that your own mind , in the vehicle , the different of the .
it was really incredibly profound profound profound
and maybe a little a little a little bit of what might happen in a few decades , when you have <unk> to to explore some or things things , in all all sorts of <unk> <unk> that i can imagine .
after these these , we we we we we were seen what we &apos;ve seen to learn to really value , for example , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . these are essentially aliens , but here on earth .
they are living with the help .
they don &apos;t exist in a in sunlight , the system , how we do .
and so you can see animals that are going to next to a 500 degrees centigrade , they can survive there .
at the same time i was interested in in the , , was again , again , the <unk> of my childhood .
and so i ended up to people who are interested in space and and and and and and in the and and you &apos;re planning to two , and you &apos;re going to russia , through the mission , the the the and and and , and then then take our <unk> .
that was fascinating .
but at the end it was out that i took <unk> with the sea sea .
i took them with and and you access to the the world , <unk> , <unk> , , , , people interested interested in these extreme situations , i took them to the to take them , and and , and and and and and so on .
we were doing in , , but actually , , , , , , , , .
so the the <unk> of my existence as a <unk> , as a child , and the the reality .
in the course of this discovery of discovery , i &apos;ve a lot of .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science . but i think you &apos;re sure , a director , can also to to a a , like a <unk> or like like a <unk> or like that .
i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i <unk> these these . .
because at some point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what comes out ? &quot;
these <unk> films make us &apos;t make us money .
we &apos;re just play the costs . of space . &apos;t have . .
everybody think i was between the titanic &quot; and the , &quot; and the , and the the on on a on a beach on the beach .
i &apos;ve all all these films , these , , , for a very small audience .
no virtue , no &apos;t , no money , no money . what are you doing ?
you &apos;re doing it to the the the the , the the the the the environment that there are , you &apos;re doing it , and because of the strange , , because of the strange , , a small group of people a team .
because we &apos;ve made all this with only 10 to 12 people who worked for years , , and sometimes we were two two to three months in the .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the to you you have a one , because you have a job that you don &apos;t be to to .
if you go back to land and and , , &quot; we had to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the all the the , the , , the the , , , and the , , , you can &apos;t , and , and you know , you know , you know , you know it never .
there &apos;s a connection , a each respect respect .
so when i got back to to my next film , &quot; let i tried to to the same leadership , which is that you to get the team and they took to respect .
and that has really changed the dynamic .
so i was back with a little team on <unk> terrain . we were &quot; &quot; with with a new technology that didn &apos;t have before .
it &apos;s incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we were been to a a of a a of a .
it changed changed my way to make the movies , completely .
there were people who were thought we would actually have this <unk> <unk> and and on the planet .
for me , it was more a more <unk> way to do my job , the the process that has changed in the .
so what can we all this this ?
what lessons we learned ?
i think thinking , the first thing .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can can even make a reality .
and the needs of your teams is more important than all the world .
to me boy who come to say , &quot; give me a advice of how i can do this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t <unk> yourself .
it &apos;s already you . do not do it yourself , bet not sit against yourself . so take risks . &quot;
nasa has a <unk> , , &quot; fail not nothing alternative . &quot;
but in the art and in in the , you have to be an alternative , because it makes a <unk> . .
no important one , the innovation , , has ever been without risk .
you have to willing to be ready to take simple risks .
that &apos;s the idea that i want to give you to you , fail is not an alternative , but it &apos;s not a . thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
and that may be something because my <unk> in the foundation in the foundation of vaccines and seeds , to the things that we have invent and deliver to deliver the poorest billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , actually even more important than any other on the planet .
<unk> means that whose <unk> are are not going to grow over a years , we we &apos;ll go to a lot of it , and we &apos;ll change the things that can change the way that it can &apos;t be .
this leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to . .
so , will a climate will be terrible for you .
and also is the <unk> for you .
the fact is that if you could reduce it from the price of the , to the the the most effective .
now , the <unk> is is over time .
in fact , the <unk> is <unk> .
the <unk> was became the industrial revolution , and in the 20th century , there was a a case of the , and so we have refrigerators , we we can make to to , , we can make modern materials and so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation in the in the rich .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s go from the price -- we we we a new barrier and this barrier depends on co2 .
co2 becomes co2 the planet , and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they <unk> the <unk> co2 , which is to the <unk> and and and that <unk> has a very negative consequences , and maybe but , but , but but , the the , the the of of natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt such as a and and and .
now , the exact relationship between a <unk> and and and and and and where their other are now , there &apos;s some of , , but not very many .
and there &apos;s probably a of about how bad this follow , but they &apos;re extremely bad .
i &apos;ve been asked the <unk> times , &quot; , &quot; do we really come down to zero ?
enough of half a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is : until we get to zero , it becomes the temperature .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say , we &apos;ve got a half a back , a back , a a feet , , you can can the sort of <unk> underneath it .
this is a little bit to down to zero .
well , we &apos;re a a lot of <unk> , , over 26 billion tons .
every americans about 20 tons . people people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons of on the planet .
and somehow we need to make that that to zero zero .
it &apos;s gone up .
only different economic changes , it , , and we have to have to have to <unk> increase in <unk> and to to zero .
this equation has four . . a little bit of a . they have this thing on the left -- -- that will to to to the and and that &apos;s to to the the of the , the average energy of development and the energy energy energy , which is <unk> energy energy .
so let &apos;s look at each one one and and we we we we get it to zero .
probably probably one of these numbers has to get to zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let &apos;s walk it through .
we first we have the population .
today &apos;s life billion people today .
and it &apos;s going to to nine billion billion <unk> to move on nine billion billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new , , which is the <unk> and <unk> , we could be that 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see a a in a .
the second factor are the services that we use .
it involves all that food that we eat , clothes , tv , and .
these are very good things and and , and , and that services , almost to to any on the planets .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , the top billion , we could be able to make <unk> and less and less , but in average , and they &apos;re going to be more than the , , the than double the the of the the .
here is a very fundamental service . are you go home to the to the ?
and these students didn &apos;t have it , so you &apos;re out and read their their <unk> under the <unk> .
well , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
we have something that &apos;s not .
in of different successes of the , , through other <unk> , through new ways , and there are lots of services , and energy energy , their energy energy , and to 90 percent .
in other service , like the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> is that for for , is a lot smaller .
in , , , we &apos;re optimistic , we may get a to a factor one factor or maybe even one factor .
but at the first three factors , we now we live billion billion billion billion tons , and , and it &apos;s just not enough !
so , let &apos;s see the fourth factor of -- and this is going to be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s a energy energy .
it turns out to ask whether you can get it to zero .
when you burn coal , no .
when you burn gas gas : no .
almost every <unk> for for power for the co2 , but renewables and renewables and
so , what we need to do is to do a global level , to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , i i use the term miracle &quot; wonder , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and services is a miracle .
people have a to of many of of those miracle .
and usually , there &apos;s no a that you need a miracle to a a a a a date .
you &apos;re just just just to just go and and and , and you can &apos;t .
but in this case , we need to get to and a wonder and a a in very short time .
well , i wondered , how can i really get this ?
is there a natural <unk> , , a demonstration that that the the of people here ?
i remembered the last year when i brought and and i liked people that .
the idea was really , you , you know , you know , there &apos;s people who live with mosquitos .
for , for , , this one .
i decided that that from inspired my <unk> to to the to the environment .
so here &apos;s a few natural fireflies .
i told me that they don &apos;t bite . in fact , you don &apos;t even leave the glass glass .
well , there &apos;s all kinds of <unk> like this , but they don &apos;t get a lot .
we need solutions , either or several several or several several of them and and <unk> , and and , and though there are lots of directions where people are looking for , , i really only see these these these these these . .
i have a framework , <unk> , fusion and and .
so , might be able to take a <unk> , and if you better better than i expect to be , but my i &apos;m here is that we have to work on all of these , and we can &apos;t give up to them because because all have significant problems .
let &apos;s first look at the burning fossil fuels , it &apos;s from from or or or natural gas .
what you have to do there , may seem easy , but it &apos;s not . you have to have all the the co2 that comes out of the <unk> , , , , , and and and and hope it &apos;s there .
there are some <unk> that that that that on 60 percent -- 80 percent where , but it &apos;s to to 100 percent , but to be a to to a a to the for the of co2 , is a big challenge , but the most problem here is the problem .
who &apos;s going to make it ?
who can guarantee something , which literally , a lot of billions of the of of the of of the you can imagine of <unk> and other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a hard thing .
next : <unk> .
it &apos;s also a big problems . the cost , especially in in countries , high , and the question of , that , that you can feel that &apos;t go wrong , despite the human differently that that the &apos;s not to for weapons .
and what do you do with the waste ?
because although it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of
so three very difficult problems that might be be , and you should be .
the last three three the five have put up .
it &apos;s renewables , as they often often called .
and also , even though it &apos;s great that you need no fuel -- you have some of .
one is the energy energy that that these technologies are dramatically dramatically than than the . .
these are <unk> , , you &apos;re talking a a of of a times more more than a a power power power .
and , sometimes these sources .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem to the all day , they doesn &apos;t seem to the the the wind .
so , you have to have to get on those sources , that &apos;s a way that energy in time if you &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s great <unk> here . there are challenges in the transmission , and if we say , the energy of the country , not only need the technology , they have to deal with the risk that from where from from .
and there &apos;s the <unk> . .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve been all of of these things that are made , looked at , , , , , mobile phones , and , and i found that the the of the that we we we make , we &apos;re making less than 10 10 minutes of the <unk> . .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that is to be a factor of 100 than the ways to be the .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
this happens when you &apos;re trying to take this <unk> sources of about say , we have 20 percent -- 30 percent of the . .
if you want to to to to 100 percent of it , they need an incredible <unk> .
now , what we &apos;re going to go : what is the right approach ?
one &quot; manhattan project ? how do we come to the goal ?
what we need is a lot of companies that work working . hundreds .
in every of these parts , we need at least 100 people .
in many many you will say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there are many of the ted group there are many that are there .
bill big big big big companies , among other , , a great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> technologies in tens of companies that are the great things and and and and and i try to support this .
nathan myhrvold and i design a company , which perhaps surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
there are a few innovation in the <unk> , , , liquid .
and the &apos;s stopped in this industry , a time ago , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts across around .
the <unk> means that instead of a part of the <unk> , , one percent , the the , , we decided to burn 99 percent 99 percent of burn .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you had been thought about it long long time , but you could never simulate can be , whether it &apos;s going to be , it &apos;s going to be there , it , you can see it , and you can see that , yes , it looks like it .
and because you &apos;re that 99 percent , it &apos;s a much better better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use waste waste of today are .
instead of break the head on it , it it . it &apos;s a great thing .
the uranium is being used , a little a a a a candle .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often often &quot; <unk> wave reactor . &quot;
it really really the the . .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste that 99 percent , you have the part that is going to be , , , is <unk> uranium .
the <unk> the u.s. u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re <unk> and and and , you get , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to come forward .
let &apos;s think about how we need to measure our success .
how should our our change ?
well , we &apos;re going to to the goal we we to get to and then we talk about the .
many of a percent percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of the percent will be produced in poor countries , and as well , , , , , and , and , and be up to be clean up .
so , to get this 80 percent , the developed developed developed developed developed countries , including countries like china , they completely change .
the other note will say if we use the technology technology , whether they have in in in the developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them .
this is great important .
this is a a part of this <unk> .
if we go back from there , how should this be to to be
it should have both both elements .
we should use the <unk> to to to reduction down , the less we less less less than the , the the , and the the temperature and the temperature .
but actually , this note that the things that we &apos;re doing that which we &apos;re doing that not completely to the the <unk> , , or even something less important as the other that the the speed of innovation for this breakthroughs .
this this is have to <unk> with <unk> , and we can measure : in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books to this issue .
the al gore says &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david <unk> <unk> <unk> energy air air air . &quot;
they &apos;re really going to and create a a of and create a a in which can be been by the , because we need support support support all of .
there &apos;s a lot of that needs to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very very , wish that we invent this technology .
if you &apos;re just me for the next 50 years , i could pick the president , a vaccine , and i love , i could choose that wish , which is , <unk> <unk> , it would take the to that wish .
this has the the the the .
if we &apos;re not get that desire , will be the between between long and the same same , people , between the united states and china , between the and and and and , and almost all of life life , two billion are going to be .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i do ?
we have to use for more research .
as countries meet in places like <unk> , they don &apos;t just talk about co2 .
you should talk to these <unk> , and they were shocked to be <unk> on the small low that that that these innovative approaches to these innovative approaches .
we need <unk> , , , , <unk> , <unk> &amp; amp ; trade something that creates a a . .
we have to spread the message .
we need to be able to <unk> and and and and the things that are done by government .
it &apos;s a important desire , but i think we can overcome it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . so much . only to to understand a little more -- -- , , can you give us a idea of scale of the scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to to the the of a a to to all the the the , we we we only need a 10 million , and , and if we tested using our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s in the <unk> .
the hard step is the the first <unk> of the first <unk> , , find another billion , the the and the the place of the the first .
once the first one , when he &apos;s as as i , , it &apos;s all clear , because the , the the is is so different than the as we know it .
to to understand that , to this means to build a a a a a a a vertical nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear , , and then the process , and then the process , and then it &apos;s working down ?
<unk> : right . now , you have to have the reactor &apos;s the , so there are many lot of people and many of the controls that go wrong , and this thing you can go up and <unk> things , and that &apos;s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can give it for 60 years -- think of a column -- they buried , without the all the . .
and it &apos;s sitting there and and for 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> that the even a a solution to the garbage .
<unk> : yes . now , what happens to the waste : you can let it -- there &apos;s a lot of waste with this method -- then take it and put it into the the the reactor and burn it into it .
and we &apos;re , by taking the garbage that exists , in this <unk> or <unk> , , that is our <unk> . .
so what this reactors is a problem , what we we in in our and and that will reduce the <unk> in the in the process .
but as you &apos;ve talked about these world world about these opportunities .
where is the biggest interest to do that really ?
<unk> : well we don &apos;t have a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting <unk> for everything that &quot; nuclear &quot; &quot; the name , and there &apos;s a big interest and the people were in russia , and i was and and i &apos;ve met the <unk> and and and talk about how this is .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese , something done something in the direction .
this is a thing of one thing that was done .
this is a more step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster and and and countries have built these , that &apos;s why everybody who has a fast reactor , a <unk> for for our first .
in your notion : i guess and and probability that really call something really in life ?
<unk> : well we need one of these <unk> , , things that are very cheap , we &apos;ve been 20 years to the and and and and 20 years .
this is essentially the the that that that that that we have to to to .
and , you know , <unk> , , when everything &apos;s well , and that &apos;s a big wish , could that it could easily .
and fortunately , there dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of , , , , if the work work , that work for their pilots , to be able to .
and it would be best when it could get several , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
the great great of great , is is the biggest thing you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is is most important thing .
it &apos;s been the the without the the , but it &apos;s so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as this , but there &apos;s the <unk> method , that &apos;s a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid <unk> that seems difficult to be , , but maybe that &apos;s about us .
and so there are different , , but the beauty of it is that a a million times a a of energy , as a , , , and and , and , if you can deal with the , , the the , the the , , the the , , and other things , almost in in a own . .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
we need to to to to try to keep the <unk> stable ?
<unk> : when you come in this situation , it &apos;s like too much , you &apos;re a a a heart attack , and a heart attack , what you do ? you need a <unk> or or you have a <unk> or or .
there &apos;s a <unk> that called <unk> called the , which is with different , to <unk> the warming , so we &apos;re 20 or 30 years longer .
this is just a <unk> . .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you should not work at work work , because perhaps that that that that you eat , because you know that you know that a the <unk> .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you take the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a way in <unk> about whether you should have to to , if you have to get faster faster , or that innovation needs longer more more , or it needs .
<unk> : do you have a or two sentences for to to to you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the the of a very different camps .
those who make the scientific case are very little .
do you tell that there is negative implications that have to do with clouds , things things ?
there are very , very few things that they can tell they can tell you that there is a a of a .
the <unk> is is like like you know , like aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot of later .
and so &apos;s why the idea , if you have all kinds of problems problems in something that you get in , and it &apos;s , and it &apos;s the investment is not necessarily the the the , and , and , , , , that &apos;s not a a drama .
the fact is that uncertainty , that uncertainty .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and the co2 , , and the the , , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not not that it &apos;s not it , it it &apos;s cheaper , it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be your answer to the <unk> <unk> argument that if you used all of time and and energy to solve the carbon problem , all the other goals , the , , , to invest , for , in , in there better things that we can do .
<unk> : well , the actual spending for research -- -- -- we &apos;re spend the u.s. for 10 billion per year , that &apos;s not that &apos;s not that .
underneath , , else &apos;s not to to .
you get to to big <unk> , and here can do whatever people who who are not , , that &apos;s not economic , and trying to to it , to to to that &apos;s the possible of waste .
because it &apos;s very short before a <unk> , and just just the the learning . i think we should do more things that have the potential to be much less less .
if the <unk> of the you get , a very high <unk> , , you can can just keep the the
i mean , every one of us could spend five times as much for our energy without changing his lifestyle .
but for the , the , , the , , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> thinks about .
his new <unk> is is , &quot; why won &apos;t the <unk> to before research ? &quot;
he &apos;s still still , because of his earlier stories , with with the <unk> , , but he understood that that a very a of a , and so he &apos;s the the . .
and this is a <unk> of that i think for appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little that will be .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about almost all people people here when i say , i really hope that you will come true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a years ago , here at ted , peter <unk> named a <unk> called called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
the idea is simple , and , <unk> , the the the world &apos;s <unk> structure with 20 , , , about feet , about feet , about feet and a a a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be on top of it .
and even though it really seems easy , it &apos;s really hard because it &apos;s people to to them very quickly .
and so i thought this this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a <unk> . .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve been about 70 last last last last , , , , , and architects , even with the <unk> of the and , and there &apos;s something about this task of what , to to in nature , and i want to share some of them with you .
and usually most people to to the to the .
you talk about it , what it is going to look like , it &apos;s to .
then they invest a little time in planning and organization . they and and they &apos;re spaghetti spaghetti .
they &apos;re at a lot of their time in the <unk> structures time .
and finally , before before you don &apos;t have time , someone the marshmallow , and they put them on the the top , step back and and , &quot; <unk> ! admire their work .
but then , , , , happened , the &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; &quot; is &quot; because the weight of the the is the the and and and and .
there &apos;s a series of people who have much more more &quot; <unk> , than others , and the worst are fresh <unk> .
they &apos;re they &apos;re they &apos;re confused , they &apos;re really <unk> .
and of course , there &apos;s even teams have the much more &quot; <unk> , and the best are fresh members of the <unk> .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as we did peter told us , they &apos;re not only the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be ask is : how does this ? why ? why ? what about these ?
and peter tells , &quot; don &apos;t have the children children spent the of of the of the . .
they don &apos;t invest in the .
there &apos;s another reason .
and that that that <unk> were trained to find the idea of , ok .
and it &apos;s realize it .
what what happens if you put the marshmallow on the the , they don &apos;t have time and what happened ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what &apos;s different different is that they start to go with the marshmallow and build the , , successful , , with the marshmallow at the the , so they they spend a <unk> to repair the prototype .
<unk> <unk> that kind of collaboration as the core of a <unk> .
and with every attempt , the kids get their feedback , which is not what .
so the performance of work with a , , but we see see how different teams are . .
the average for most of the , , , , , of the , of of it , , , , , , , , , , better than the adults .
who &apos;s on the most successful ?
architects and engineers , to happiness .
three three is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to build stable structures .
<unk> are something about average . but it &apos;s interesting .
you you a <unk> <unk> on on the team , they will be better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see see , and you see see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is this ?
because they have special skills of the .
they run the process , they understand him .
and that team that the on and and and the work will be the performance of the team .
they skills skills and and and and their and their combination .
if you have 10 10 to have 10 , which are typical , they get about six , that get stable . .
i tried to be some exciting .
i thought , we we the the the .
so i gave offered a <unk> of the for the winner .
what what happened to do with these <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anybody was built high construction construction , he would have the the price home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high <unk> have a strong effect ?
we went through this practice with the same students .
so what happened happened ?
now she understood the advantage of the . . &quot;
this is the same , , the team of the best .
they produced the highest construction of the time .
there are most <unk> lessons lessons for us , about the of of and success .
you like ask , why would somebody actually make a <unk> a a <unk> ?
the reason is , i think i think , to help to the digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games
and what the <unk> is does is , they &apos;re helping hidden assumptions .
because , , every project has got your own marshmallow .
the challenge is a shared experience , a common language , a a , , the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience of this simple practice .
and those of you who are interested in , <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> of there .
you find crazy examples of all the world how people optimize the system and <unk> .
there &apos;s also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson i think is , the construction is actually a <unk> sport .
it it that we all all our senses , and , and we we we use our our think we use our our , , our feelings and our , in the challenge that we &apos;re .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience of this experience of what it takes us from a &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot;
and this can make a huge difference .
thank you .
we we we have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool , , machine machine , and this is a machine machine .
and everybody in this room must be inside .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; they can &apos;t go in here and now .
and i wonder what they would choose because i often have my friends in a time , i have to go and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to back back in the time before there were , or twitter or or or the &quot; the &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that you kind of <unk> to <unk> to <unk> .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and i don &apos;t tell you a a .
it &apos;s because there are there are able to go back on this planet , they go forward .
so i want to to this machine , and i want to go to the future .
this is the greatest greatest time that gave the on on this planet , no matter what scale scale is to : health , wealth , mobility , get , , , get declining .
there was never been a time like this .
my <unk> , , all of them died as they were 60 .
my grandparents grandparents was this number on <unk>
my parents are the 80 on the <unk> .
so there should better a a nine of my my .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a larger thing than that .
a kid that can be born in new new as as as as the the the the the the the world in 100 years ago .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox made billion people on this planet .
they &apos;ve actually shaped the demographics of the earth in a way , no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they are gone .
we have them <unk> . . .
in the rich world , the of of us , the millions of us have have a a generation , still have .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
anyone know even anybody what this is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billion people , are are are are of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method , to try and look if it works , it it it it doesn &apos;t do it , one of the greatest agenda of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , it &apos;s the whole news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they were mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all our of our first , a billion people in the world every day ? every day ?
this number goes up , and it goes very quickly , and it &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we have used our imagination to <unk> this world .
drinking , <unk> country , rainforests , oil , gas : they &apos;re disappear , and if we don &apos;t we &apos;re not from this chaos , we we &apos;re .
so the question is , can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions , without the land that life on their life .
i think we can provide this world to energy that they &apos;re not .
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a <unk> .
but this is me wake up at night -- one of the things that i me up at night , we never needed to have no to have that we &apos;ve never had .
and we were also never able to make it <unk> , , as we can do it .
we &apos;re on the the threshold , amazing events on many many areas , and yet i really think we we have hundreds of years ago , to find a time in the we we have to to more more , we &apos;ve more more more more more more more more more .
people are in their faith , and so so they can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth is it it .
and listen , everybody &apos;s a right on his mind , even a a right on the .
but do you know what you &apos;re &apos;t right ?
they don &apos;t have right to their own facts . &apos; <unk> , , don &apos;t have .
and i took a while for me to figure out .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about the for the new yorker , &quot; the new yorker , a little article .
and i was amazed by the resistance , to resistance , which is what what the the most effective method in in human human .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i i i i i did , i wrote an article and went .
and soon soon , i wrote an article about the . .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were crazy .
so i i written an article , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they they thought that molecules in a a of a a kind of <unk> <unk> a <unk> of of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i took on .
i mean , i am a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re rich , we &apos;re going to eat , that &apos;s okay .
but this article was worried about , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found it out .
and that &apos;s because these who who were crazy , i didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
these were <unk> people , people people , people , people .
they were just like people in this room .
and that brought me to see this .
but then i thought , you know what , we know , let &apos;s face .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re <unk> to be with little little about about , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s reasons , and i think we know what &apos;s the reasons .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it should not be that .
you can just call a call call a few name and people will understand .
in , , <unk> , the <unk> , , mass of , the <unk> 2000 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are are questions and problems with the people we thought that they were right . so be skeptical .
ask ask , you evidence evidence , you evidence evidence .
don &apos;t take anything for the .
but here &apos;s : if you get to evidence evidence , and it &apos;s not good .
and i can tell that that we now live in an epidemic of fear of life , like i never seen you , and hope hope never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story came in a , a a a that the <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine in the .
very frightening .
there were tons of studies were done to see if that was true .
there are some of of them should be done ; that &apos;s a serious matter .
the data came in .
the data came in in the u.s. states from england , from sweden , and , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no . .
it doesn &apos;t make difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because we believe believe , think , we think what we see what we see what what makes us feel like .
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents from a <unk> that &apos;s data , and i understand that , i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re all .
but do you know what ?
the result of it was <unk> .
in fact , the the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the <unk> <unk> goes down .
this is <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s horrible .
what what happened to do that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do . .
because here &apos;s here ?
did one single in the audience ever die of ?
not &apos;s not not happening .
it &apos;s not in at this country at all , but it &apos;s the last year .
these are many death from from , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not happening here , we can find it into , and people like <unk> <unk> can walk around and and and from of and and of of the and and larry king live preach .
and they can make them , because they &apos;re not together and and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem be the same , but almost never the same thing .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , , , disappeared .
the guy in the middle not so much .
it &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he &apos;s developed a a a of other people .
he can save the lives of <unk> , five children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
well , this is good , besides that paul <unk> and and and as as they are , and they they &apos;re just to to .
and that &apos;s what he is what he is . .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul talks in a public public <unk> , he doesn &apos;t tell you by <unk> .
he gets calls calls home home because because people like to to him where to go to school .
and why ? because paul has a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
take them , you get the diseases , , , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
we have now in this country now .
and that gets worse , and quite soon , children will be dying again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they will not only die of them .
what about <unk> ? we &apos;re going to do that . why not ?
a a of mine wrote me a few weeks ago , and said said , i i a little bit of <unk> .
nobody one has ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t get your child against <unk> . . no no .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have <unk> . , and you know what ?
we had no <unk> in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe this morning , in in in in in a plane , and going to go on los angeles , at the moment , he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he ends up and <unk> a car , and he &apos;s going to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these <unk> <unk> tonight tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that it &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know that , because that &apos;s how the world works .
this is the planet that we live . don &apos;t do it as it &apos;s not .
we love to <unk> us . we love that .
did you all all the the to the
<unk> , a little bit of a that that will you to the . .
i know that you &apos;ve made that because half the americans makes it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make difference , how often we &apos;re , .
the data is constantly constantly .
they make their urine . more they never never .
it &apos;s okay , you like to make 28 billion dollars for the for the . .
i &apos;m going to be them .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i know -- we hate the <unk> industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and that &apos;s &apos;t what we should . our healthcare system is it .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and <unk> itself to us that can afford .
so we &apos;re going away , and where are we going ?
we walk into the arms of the . .
this is great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is really serious issue , because the stuff is crap , and we &apos;re going billions of dollars .
and i &apos;ve all all kinds of little <unk> here .
don &apos;t -- -- <unk> , , , , , , , , , , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;re spend billion dollars for it , it &apos;s . .
and you know what ? if i say that , people , me , and say , &quot; what do you do ? let &apos;s do people people what they want .
so you &apos;re feeling . . &quot;
and you know what ? they have wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t care whether it &apos;s the <unk> , says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to think the the of my my , &quot; or any <unk> that wants to treat his patients with <unk> .
if you go into that way , and magic and magic and and and and , you get to a place where they don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he brought 400,000 400,000 of his people , because he was that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and more effective than than drugs drugs , which we know that they can get the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of death death in a country that gets worse than any other of this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these these things don &apos;t have .
they have them . they have always them .
now , the <unk> epidemic we &apos;re in now is this <unk> struggle between the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . she &apos;s to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , over metaphor .
this is ideology , not science .
all we eat , every <unk> , every , , every branch , every <unk> , , has changed by the .
you know , there was no <unk> in in paradise .
there was no <unk> . .
there was no <unk> . . we did this all .
we did it in the last the years .
and some of it has worked and and some of them .
we &apos;re <unk> , which doesn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more , and of course , there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a , , and the can help millions of people people to make their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do it ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we <unk> made food food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i hear is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to be huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want to patent lives .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
and you know what my answer to all this ?
yes , you &apos;re right . we we . .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , , but that &apos;s not science .
it has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know that science is no company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do , because we &apos;re afraid to do , , is a real dead , and they &apos;re millions of people from the . .
you know , in the next 50 years , we will have to grow 70 percent more food than the . . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
well , <unk> .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give them them .
and why ? <unk> changed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff like <unk> .
<unk> is something that &apos;s half a billion people .
it &apos;s about like a . .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s it .
it doesn &apos;t sense nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have protein protein , and scientists build this just in this .
and then people could eat the food and they would not be blind .
you wouldn &apos;t get , , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> <unk> , but it would be nice .
and all i can say , why do we fight this ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask , why do we fight that ?
because we don &apos;t want to <unk> genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes , it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our our on higher food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about by , , it &apos;s about people people alive , and it &apos;s going to get the time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , we we do as we we we &apos;re doing something about something that we think about , not to be guilty , how : how to be .
there &apos;s no other description for what happens here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of it , and we have to be the . .
so , after this incredibly funny conversation , you might say , &quot; you want to be able to time time back and go back into the future ? &quot;
anyway , i &apos;m going to . .
now , you &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can think of this time machine , we we want .
we can take them up where we &apos;re going to , and we &apos;re going to move them to where we want to go .
we need to lead those conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into the time , and we &apos;re going to go into the the future , we we &apos;re going to be .
i know that we can , and as far as it &apos;s to me , something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for a time , i &apos;m interested in the <unk> . , and it might strange seem strange that a magician was interested in it , it &apos;s like me as &quot; a a that &apos;s going to something something , when somebody thinks of enough of it . &quot;
in other words , <unk> , in some studies , a a of of , , , , and is because because the person thinks what happens to you , a a , or a , , , , , , the patient , , a a effect of the body .
a deception becomes something real , because somebody &apos;s so . .
so we &apos;re also to to start with each other , i want to show you a basic , , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that at least since the 1950s in every day of children .
i gave him from the <unk> <unk> magic magic in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to explain it for you and and it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife that can study that you can can , my hand that can can can .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife like that in my my .
i my my my . .
and to sure nothing in my my , , , , , i &apos;m just going to get my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that &apos;t move time to time . as i as i can see here , can &apos;t go into my off my own .
and the goal is really simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife is <unk> by my naked physical . .
it actually actually the in the place that i can shake it without the knife .
nothing goes in my off , or , , not <unk> , , and they can study all .
<unk> !
now , this is a trick that i often have little little children , that , , because you can get a lot about deception when you &apos;re a a , , even it &apos;s very simple <unk> trick .
probably many of you here in the hall here .
it works works .
i think the knife in my hand .
i i say i &apos;m my wrist <unk> to make sure that nothing in my my , , , , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m my wrist , is that that is the real secret of illusion .
because , where i &apos;m my hand , you you you see you see them from the back , this fingers here , my <unk> , , just where he was , in a position where he &apos;s so <unk> .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody sitting there , somebody who had no childhood .
so , it &apos;s here . right .
and when i <unk> , the the fingers changes its position .
and now you might talk about why that is a deception why you can &apos;t see that there are only three fingers , : because the mind , the the way it does information , it &apos;s not one , one , two , two , but it as a
but that &apos;s what it is not now , , and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s , , it &apos;s not by the the of my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , that &apos;s now there .
and if i close my hand , the same thing i &apos;m going to , by by this this , that that the fingers .
i take this hand , and here is the knife .
that trick you can show your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what do do do with the the ?
a year ago , i read a study that really really really my mind .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and so that was a amazing thing to me .
and what it turns out , if you offer a <unk> in a <unk> in a <unk> , in the form of a <unk> , is just a round of a , , a a a a a a of
but if you &apos;re the shape that they &apos;re to to just , , for example , in a into a smaller pill , and blue color and a letter to it , it &apos;s actually actually effective effective .
and that , although no one of them -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? it really really me me .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
if you take a , , more more more than every is every .
a colored capsule that is at a end of the , and the is better than a white capsule .
the the plays plays a role .
a only a a a a a a day , and a day , and i can &apos;t remember the the statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
but the key is , ... ...
... also , the the the role of play .
and the form plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate ultimate system , you have to take the needle needle .
right ? one syringe with a <unk> -- a a of a <unk> substance that you get to .
it creates a very strong picture in your head . that &apos;s much stronger than a white pill .
this graph is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time if we have a <unk> .
and the fact that the white takes not takes as well as the blue pill , not as well as a a was not as well as the needle .
and none of this has really a of that &apos;s , it &apos;s just our faith that it &apos;s a more stronger effect in us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea of magic trick .
i &apos;ll take something that obvious is obviously a deception , and let &apos;s look it .
we know from the study that you have to to to the needle if it &apos;s to to to to the .
this is a 18 inches of long . it &apos;s very , very <unk> , and i &apos;m going to a little bit of .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not <unk> special <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
i &apos;m going to put this needle in my skin and through through them , until it <unk> on the other side .
if you &apos;re bad , if you &apos;re easily in -- i &apos;ve a few last last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and i had a a woman .
so i &apos;m propose if you quickly , you you &apos;re going to look at the next 30 seconds , or you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first first part of the back there .
you can see it , you can also see it , if you want .
so , it &apos;s going to , right here where my meat starts , at the bottom of my arm , i just just going to make a little <unk> .
i &apos;m &apos;m . . does it make it crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and and on the other hand , so again .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation we had in the <unk> .
something about it .
but now you can &apos;t count my finger , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yes .
i know what people think if you see that .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid and <unk> itself to to the the skin for a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;m going to show you .
what does this like ? ? pretty good .
yes , i know .
and people come back , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see that . &quot;
people are in in the in the .
let me show you you you .
that &apos;s really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
that &apos;s my meat , and i can the the <unk> .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re going to look , , look at , don &apos;t look .
people people back , the that later , that later , , , , , &quot; well , this looks quite impressive , but if it was real , it , it , it &apos;s a hole , and there &apos;s a , , it would be to . &quot;
okay , let me give you a little of blood for you .
yeah , here it &apos;s .
i i would take the needle now .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no <unk> .
but i think in this framework here and with the purpose of a a something real , , i &apos;m going to go the needle there and go and go on the stage .
we &apos;ll have a few few of the next days .
i hope you you you you . thank you .
everybody talks about happiness .
i &apos;ve been a few people who have been count the number of the in the in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 years , and there were a lot more .
there &apos;s an massive wave of interest in the researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of the tide of work , there are several cognitive that , that we &apos;re kind of to think about thinking about thinking about thinking .
and my talk today is mainly by by cognitive cognitive .
this is for <unk> that you think about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think thinking about happiness because it turns out , we &apos;re as as as everyone else .
the first one of these fall is a <unk> , to start to .
it turns out that the word is simply not a useful word because because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain of that we could just just to it , but in the big , and it &apos;s something that we need to be up , and we will going to take the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second case is a <unk> of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s between be in in life and happy happy to his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that is the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a question that well-being well-being without the . .
i mean , this is a real cognitive functions .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a a <unk> , after my my my , who had a story , &#91; unclear -- he said he had a symphony , and it was a a of a , and it was a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then he , , really really emotionally emotionally , that has been the whole experience .
but that didn &apos;t .
what it was that was the memories of the experience .
he had had experience .
he had had 20 20 minutes of music .
they didn &apos;t take it because he was an memory , he was was , and the memory was all he had to .
what what what that is us is that we might think about other people , in the sense of the other of of themselves .
there &apos;s a <unk> of itself in the present present and the present , is able to experience the past , but basically , the the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> self that the doctor &apos;s doctor -- you know , the doctor says , &quot; does it hear , &quot; if i you you here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a <unk> of itself , and the <unk> itself is is that the the and the story of our life , and it &apos;s the that that the the to make the , &quot; how did you feel in a time ? &quot;
or &quot; how was her journey to ? ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the <unk> itself and the <unk> itself , and the two to to the the of of the of happiness .
now , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
and it really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we &apos;re not only tell stories , when we &apos;re doing to tell stories .
our our our told us stories that means what we can get to our our our our our .
and let &apos;s start with an example of .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients , which is a painful procedure in . .
i won &apos;t go into detail . it &apos;s not painful , because it was painful , it was painful than this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to to all the 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who from have have from have have more from ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b is clearly more suffered , his <unk> , it was longer longer , and every of of pain , the patient had had a times times times with the times more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how did these patients do that they were it ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a a much more <unk> to the the of the than patient .
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story is , how it ends .
and there &apos;s no one of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is worse worse than the other .
and the one that was worse is where the pain was at the end of the end , it &apos;s a very bit .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people to their <unk> , and also , and , and it &apos;s a lot later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing of ? &quot;
and she was a much worse for a for the .
well , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> itself and the <unk> itself .
from the <unk> of the , , the <unk> , the thing is clearly a .
now , what you could do with a patient , and we actually done clinical clinical experiments , and it &apos;s done , and it works , you could actually be the the of the patient by by just by by the the , without it to it .
this is going to lead that the patient suffering , but a little and a lot less than before .
and if you have power for a few minutes , you have the the the of the a is worse , and you have made that the the of itself is a much better , , because , you have a better story about his experience .
what &apos;s a story of this ?
and that is for the stories that us us and it &apos;s also with the stories that we invent .
what &apos;s a story of a is a , , , , and and end .
end is very , very important and in this case , <unk> the end .
well , the <unk> itself lives lives its life .
it &apos;s got the of of the , , one after another .
and they ask , what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most of the most of our life -- and i &apos;ve this thing -- you know , the psychological present is about about three seconds , and , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of it , there &apos;s about 600,000 . most of them don &apos;t leave any them .
most of you will completely ignored from the <unk> .
and yet , somehow you somehow you should count that what &apos;s going on this this is is our life .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use as we are in this world .
and as we use them , but that &apos;s not the story that the the the the the the the .
so we have the <unk> itself and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the the the difference between them is the to deal with time .
from the <unk> of the , if you have a on and the second week , the the the first , the the the most is the number of twice as as the <unk> .
that &apos;s not how it works for the <unk> .
for the <unk> self , a <unk> <unk> is barely much better than the <unk> <unk> because because there &apos;s no new memories .
they don &apos;t changed the story .
and in this way , the critical variable , the is a is a a of itself different from a <unk> itself , a very little impact on this story .
well , the <unk> self is to to to and tell stories .
it &apos;s actually the sound that makes decisions because if you have a patient , who , we had two two two two , , and decide what he would choose , which is that that &apos;s is that is the that is the that is the the that &apos;s be selected .
the <unk> itself has no voice in this choice .
actually , we don &apos;t choose to we &apos;re between our . .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as a experiences .
we think about our future as a <unk> memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a <unk> of the <unk> itself , and you can think of the <unk> self , the the of the <unk> itself , the <unk> of the , which the the doesn &apos;t need the .
i have the impression that if we &apos;re on on a very , the case , we &apos;re on on on on on the services in the services .
and this is a little bit to that i think .
i mean , how much do we <unk> from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that is given for the the of the .
and when i think about it , i think of a on a couple years ago , we &apos;ve done a couple of years ago , the best <unk> was the most been had had , and i think i think about a lot of in the as often i think of other people .
and i probably probably i started by my memories of this <unk> journey , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i ever ever opened the the , , the , i had spent another an hour .
well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s only a half hours .
there &apos;s there to be a . .
now , i love a little bit extremely , you know , in this , like little , i <unk> on the <unk> of memories , but even if you &apos;re doing a real question , why is we give us a a a a of the the the the weight that we we about ?
so i want you to think about a thought thought . thought .
imagine your next on you know , the end of the <unk> , all the the , they will get the , and they get a <unk> drug so that they &apos;re going to remember &apos;t remember .
now , would you choose the same <unk> on ?
and if you would choose to other thousand , there is a conflict between their two species of self and you have to think about how to decide that , , and it &apos;s not obviously , because if you think of time , you you &apos;re going to get a answer , and if you think of the , you you a different answer .
why we pick the the that we pick it is a problem that us a a a choice between the two species of self .
now , the two species of self just two words from happiness .
there are two concepts of happiness that we can use , one one per itself .
so you can ask , how happy is the <unk> ?
and then would ask ask : how happy are the the of the the of the ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for a , a a a complicated process .
which are the emotions that can be measured ?
and by the way , we &apos;re now going to be a good good good idea of happiness by the the of the time .
if you &apos;re the the of the , , , it &apos;s a different different thing .
this is not how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or happy is the person is if you think about their life .
very different term .
everybody who &apos;s not &apos;t different that &apos;s not different to the the of happiness , and i &apos;m one of of researchers about well-being that the the of of happiness for the long , , , in exactly the way of
the distinction between happiness happiness happiness is been recognized in the the the the the last years , and you &apos;re going to to measure the two <unk> . .
the the organization has a global survey , which more than half a million people asked ask , about what they think about their life and and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started to learn about the two species of the self .
and the main lesson that we think i &apos;ve learned is that they really are different different .
you know how you you with with his life , and this doesn &apos;t teach them a lot about how happy he live and and other .
just to give you a sense of the correlation that correlation is about <unk> .
what what that means is that if you &apos;re meet somebody , and you would say , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so so lot of uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone &apos;s life as eight on a scale of 10 , , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his <unk> . .
so the correlation is small .
we know something about what happiness happiness is . .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know happiness is that happiness , to be with with people people we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but it &apos;s a .
so if you &apos;re going to maximize the of the two species of even , they &apos;re going to do very different things .
the conclusion that i said here is that we really really &apos;t really thinking of happiness as a for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different .
now , very , , another reason that we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we &apos;re not going to be the same things that we &apos;re going to think about life and if
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , they &apos;re not going to get the correct . .
if you think that question , you think that people are going to be happier in california if you , we say , in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think of the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , , in climate .
well , it turns out climate is not very important for the <unk> itself , and it &apos;s not even important for the <unk> self that decide how happy people are .
but , because the <unk> is is responsible , you can end up at the end -- some people could come to to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting interesting to what happens to people who are going to to to to to to .
well , your <unk> itself will not be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is happen . you &apos;re going to think that you &apos;re happier , because if you will remember it &apos;s going to reminds about how horrible the weather in ohio , and they &apos;ll feel that they &apos;ve met the right decision .
it &apos;s very hard to think about well-being , and i hope i have a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we of the phone , , i told them a couple of weeks ago , they were a pretty interesting interesting outcome that came out of this <unk> survey .
is this something that you can share us , because you have a few minutes ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting thing we &apos;ve found in the the called the the , , a number that we we &apos;t &apos;t really .
we found this in the happiness of the <unk> .
if we looked at how how feelings can vary income .
and it turns out under a income from 60,000 dollars in year , and that is a very large of of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a great representative sample , under over dollars dollars a year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year , people are unhappy , and they &apos;re increasingly more less more , the the .
we &apos;re getting an absolutely flat line .
i mean , i saw so flat lines .
what happens is obvious , that money money money , but that lack of money money money were sure of money , and we can actually measure this very , very clear .
in the other self , the the self , the , , you get a different story .
the more money you make it the it .
this is not true for emotions .
but danny , in the entire american effort is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people take this <unk> seriously , i mean , it seems to to all the the , everything we believe in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there a chance that politicians that the country generally have a <unk> as the seriously , and it &apos;s doing it to work ?
<unk> : you know , i think there &apos;s recognition for the role of the in politics .
the recognition will be slowly in the united states , not a question , but in the the kingdom , you just just in other other other other other other other other other other other other .
people people are in , they they think they &apos;re thinking about politics .
it will take a while , and people are going to to want to explore whether they want to explore , or whether you want to explore , , so we have to take this discussion .
how to be happiness , very different depends on how you think and whether you think about the <unk> itself , or whether you think about the <unk> itself .
that &apos;s to change politics , i think in the years .
in the united states , you <unk> to measure the <unk> of of the population .
that &apos;s going to think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistic .
well , it seems to me , this issue , or should be at least the most interesting political debate to the the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane evans . i ask video games .
i &apos;ve been develop <unk> for 10 years , and i &apos;ve to the next decade , the next decade , it &apos;s just to to save the world in the reality , as it in <unk> .
i have a plan for this . i want to to to more people , including all of time with the time and and games games .
currently , we spend three billion hours per week .
some of you might think , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time if you think of how many problems we have in in the real world .
but actually , my research at the the of the the the future , is the the opposite of the .
three billion hours per week , they &apos;re not nearly enough to solve the most likely problems in the world .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that time .
i &apos;ve out that the needed time at 21 billion hours of it week week .
but that seems to first , , , , so i it it , so if we can work problems like hunger like hunger , poverty , climate change , i think , to get the for at at for at at a , hours per day , the next decade .
no , i really mean it seriously .
why ? this picture describes quite exactly why i believe that games for the survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a <unk> of of photographer <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to bring the emotions play , so he was built a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classical terms of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , you might have some of the in in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , something fear , , but also , , , , in the problem really , in a really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re play , you see some few of here , the eyes , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the the of .
this is a player that &apos;s on the edge of an called <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know that . okay . so so we have some few of . .
a <unk> victory is a result that &apos;s so much positive that they didn &apos;t even know it was possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you get it , they &apos;re shocked to actually be something that that &apos;s something that . this is a <unk> victory .
this player is a a a <unk> .
and this is what we have to see in of millions of faces around the world , if we take the the the the the the the the the the the face of the <unk> of the edge of a <unk> <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re more more of this face in real life when we face difficult to get difficult problems .
i call it as &quot; in life , i &apos;m bad &quot; , and it &apos;s actually my face face , yes ? ok ?
that &apos;s me , i &apos;m doing this &quot; in life .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i i in my my , , we &apos;re better better than in real life .
this is a problem that have a lot of players .
we think we &apos;re not as well as well as well as
and i &apos;m not just not just successful , even though that one .
we get in <unk> more . i mean , i mean , in the with with the motivation , to do something <unk> , to with with with .
if we &apos;re in a <unk> , , i think that many of us are into our best version , any time , and , , , , the problem , as for it as for the time , it try to try it again .
and in reality , when we &apos;re failure , we &apos;re it , we feel often feel often .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel we feel we feel but we feel threatened , perhaps depressed , frustrated , frustrated .
we we we never have , we play play games , you &apos;re not not .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study by student student student .
why is it impossible to play , you can &apos;t just think it everything ?
how can we allow these feelings to play it into reality ?
so i i looked at the world of warcraft that the the the to the the place .
and i &apos;ve found some things that the the in the in <unk> in <unk> .
so , first , if you get into one of these <unk> , , especially in world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters that are ready to give them a a mission , , and it immediately .
but not only not a mission , but a mission that fits perfect to your current level , right ?
so they create this .
you never get a task that you can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their skills , so they have to do . but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and <unk> . there &apos;s always a slightly important to do .
and there are tons of employees .
where they &apos;re going to go hundreds of hundreds of people who work with them to your their .
we don &apos;t have this so easy , not so easy , this feeling that in a <unk> of of tons of employees .
and there &apos;s this major story , this inspiring history , that we are and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they have <unk> from &quot; level , &quot; and , and one of , or , one of intelligence .
this constant feedback doesn &apos;t in real life .
if i leave this stage , i &apos;m not : and and a great great idea , and a crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get in the real life .
so , the problem of like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so much to be the on the edge of a <unk> <unk> that we so we spend all of time in these <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
until today , all the world of of <unk> , were spent millions of years of with the virtual problems of <unk> .
it &apos;s not necessarily bad thing .
it might sounds .
but to see it in the context , a million years ago , we started to go to our first <unk> . .
so the first first thing was .
ok , so , if we talk about how much time we spend on play , , it &apos;s just the sense , when you &apos;re the time in terms of the scale of human development , what is extraordinary .
but also , , it turns out that we use this whole time to play the whole time , actually change what we are are in the .
we &apos;re developing us to collaborative , , , .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe .
now , at this interesting statistic , which was recently recently by a researchers of carnegie mellon university , the average young young young young young have in in a country with a <unk> of years of <unk> with with <unk> to the the . .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two .
first first , for children in the united states , the <unk> of the the the the the the to school , from the to the school school -- if you never have .
so we have a complete <unk> of , , in the young people learning , which is what it means to be a good player , like everything else , what else they learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot;
so , you know , of the success of success , the theory of the 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research research , that , if we we spend 10,000 hours to have to have a to the the of bodies to the the to the the we will going to be in .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what the most most people are the world .
so what we have here is a third generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what are are are are ? ? &quot;
because if we could find that , we we never never have been to opportunity to do human human .
so many people are in in the world that at least hour a day with a hour .
these are our <unk> , 500 million people who are good good in something .
and in the next decade , we have another billion of , that are extraordinary good in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> that save energy and and work on <unk> , instead than the the the the the the the world , especially in india , china , in , , .
you expect one extra billion a billion billion in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion a billion .
so i started to think about what it is , what we &apos;re doing to make these games .
here are the four things i found . first , first thing .
ok , think of this like extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire immediately immediately , to a a , , , with the believe that we have a a of of .
don &apos;t have to believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth it , and it &apos;s the same .
don &apos;t sit around .
i are are in the spiders of a demographic nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that we we people , we we people after we were talking about , even if they &apos;ve to .
the reason for this is that it requires a lot of trust to play with a game .
we trust that someone to us that the rules that the rules that we have the same goal and to to the to the .
so the <unk> is the the of of , trust and and .
as a result , we &apos;re a of social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours a week , a week , as a <unk> .
the reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard when we &apos;re going to be , or nothing .
we know that we as human beings , if we do hard hard work , work .
and the are are always ready to work hard if you get the right task .
and finally , the importance .
and , it &apos;s to to be part of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
here &apos;s a <unk> of to to the right to the right , you you know all all wikipedia wikipedia , the largest &apos;s largest world .
the largest largest in the world , with almost <unk> <unk> is the world of warcraft . .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve been more information about about world of warcraft in the internet than any other other other in any other other .
they create a level of a .
they create a major source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four of the that are a single outcome . players are <unk> , , , .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is that you believe you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that &apos;s the problem i i try to do .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is awesome . he &apos;s interested in why people spend so much time , energy and money in money .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to make <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> and and and <unk> . &quot;
and that &apos;s an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not as i -- i i play games , i &apos;m a little bit .
so he says that makes makes sense , because because because players can more more than in in life .
they can make more social <unk> as a as a real life , they get more feedback and reward in play in as life .
so , he says it &apos;s completely logical that players are more time in the virtual world as the real world .
i first i &apos;m trying to be sense .
but it &apos;s definitely not a <unk> .
we need to start turn the the world in a game .
my inspiration comes from an event , <unk> <unk> years .
there are these ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
so , of this fantastic <unk> , there were <unk> .
and these were sort of the first of people were developed .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the the of the <unk> greek <unk> , you might know this story . the story of how and why why games were invented .
according to the <unk> of the games , , , more <unk> , in the the <unk> .
now , said , there was such big famine , the king of <unk> was to to a crazy idea .
people were . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation . you needed a extreme solution .
so they invented , according to <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> and a national strategy . a day , you would eat . next day .
and they would be been so in the the , , because games are so fascinating and we <unk> us , <unk> productivity that they they would forget that there were nothing to eat .
and then , the next day , you would play , and the next day you would eat .
and according to <unk> , they survive this famine years by doing this , by the next day and they were the next .
and , i think , we &apos;re playing games today .
we &apos;re playing games to get the the the the the real world .
we we put games to make everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , not not not in the real life , and we &apos;re going to we need to play .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s what exciting exciting thing .
and according to 18 years after years years , didn &apos;t have the famine years , so the king , , the king , <unk> <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two . .
they were played a <unk> , and the the could break up to a <unk> adventure .
they left up and and they were looking for a new new , and they &apos;d just so many people , how to survive how to survive survive and and the rest of the rest of the to .
it sounds crazy , right ?
but latest <unk> , show that the <unk> that that the the the the the the same dna as the old <unk> .
and so scientists came to the idea that <unk> is is true .
and geologists found a global <unk> system that took almost 20 years years of what the great . .
so this is a crazy story .
maybe they actually have their people by playing by playing 18 years by playing <unk> for 18 years , and then they had these <unk> and and and so much about the other people play , they were that they were allowed to saved the entire civilization
so , we can .
we &apos;ve been us to
this was the first <unk> in the real time of the world of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
they were <unk> for 18 years , we we ever play , 16 years .
i &apos;d say , we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> .
so , they sent to half of their civilization to the new world , so i &apos;m going to take my 21 billion <unk> per million . .
we should be that half of us a an hour a day day , we have the the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems of the world ? &quot; and and exactly this question i have have my work in the the past years on the the .
we have this <unk> in our office in in , , it &apos;s it in the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is create the future .
we want to imagine the best best result , and then people people to to to this this .
we we the to to and and people give us the opportunities to achieve them .
i &apos;m going to show you a three three games i &apos;ve designed to try to make people in in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> that they need to overcome a <unk> . .
the <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> , so it it &apos;s too realistic , and they actually live in life , and they have to be in the , , they have to be , , and they &apos;re going to be to to be , , to be , , , and to be them .
we &apos;ve been this game with the players of the players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been been over over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a change experience .
nobody wants to change life , because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> <unk> , and you say , &quot; we go . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure that you go .
find out how they were survive , most of our players have to the in the game .
so , we have a a bigger , , , to get higher goal for the .
we &apos;ve got the game &quot; the the the institute at the the .
we see the computation of a that that people only have 23 years on the planet .
this cover is called &quot; global <unk> , &quot; , of course .
the call to player , , , , we have almost like a &quot; <unk> <unk> .
you know , jerry <unk> where where it &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they have the astronauts , the scientists , the the , and they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , say , , , , , and it &apos;s our task , the future for energy , health , health , security and the future of the social .
8,000 players were playing the game eight weeks . weeks .
they they found 500 creative solutions that you can read when they &apos;re &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and the last game we get out by the third of march , and it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the bank bank .
if you get the game , you get from the world bank , the <unk> <unk> , , 2010 2010 2010 .
we work in universities in animals , and you use a to to to social . .
we have a comic book . we have got to understand &quot; level of <unk> , , , , , , and and and and .
i &apos;d like to invite you to share this game with young people , all over the world , especially in <unk> , , , to to their own social companies to save the world .
i &apos;m going to end .
i want to ask you something .
what , do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic player , we have games that we can do what we can do , but we don &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope that you agree that that players are human resources that we can can in the life , and that games are a huge meaning for change .
we have all these these , <unk> productivity , the ability to make close social nets , <unk> and the desire for <unk> .
i really hope that we play a a of play in the planet to survive one century .
and i hope you &apos;ll design and play with these these play and play .
so , i i &apos;ve been in the next decade , i &apos;m sure for two things : that we can create a different future future , and we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the the <unk> games !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something a few months ago , a a of a article on a article .
i &apos;ve my my my my my , , , but i had done with the the of text , and i realized that i never never been in my life , which &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
i read to you the post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; <unk> , &quot; , , , , , , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , , , , , , , , , , , ,
<unk> : healthy , strong , <unk> . &quot;
i had this list of a friend and read , and i , it was so ridiculous , but i just came up until &quot; and and couldn &apos;t have to up and and and and and and and and and and the <unk> .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> , i i i was that the has has to be a .
but in fact , it was a copy on the early 80s when i i started started and started started to my my self of my my very self and and and shape , and , in other children , and to other children around me .
and i don &apos;t mean , i didn &apos;t use a <unk> .
i i would take this about serious seriously , i was born in a world that someone like me as a person , , , in a way , in a way , , but i &apos;m going to have the opportunity and and that i have experienced .
so i immediately i the the of of 2009 , and i expected to think of this is a <unk> . .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
it &apos;s not a lot better .
and especially , , the last words words under the <unk> <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people we think of these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and we we these these values .
our language our our think and how we see the world and humans see around us .
many lot of <unk> societies , including the greeks and the the , , really believed that the the of a a a a a , because because what you &apos;re going to be out of <unk> , also <unk> .
so , what do we actually want to <unk> -- a a people or a a ?
and just to a a to call a child as a child , , , , they and them and them .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open doors ?
a person that opened for for doors , my a was at <unk> <unk> institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> <unk> , , the name , as you can think , most americans don &apos;t come correct , and so he was called dr. &quot; .
and dr. <unk> was always a very , and and and for the work with
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my my .
i had to take a single practice , with with with these thick , <unk> <unk> -- -- in different colors -- you know , to get my <unk> , and i &apos;ve me more than everything else . i hated them . i hated them .
and imagine , i &apos;ve been a a child with dr. <unk> , and so trying to stop this practice , <unk> without .
and one day he looked at me one of my practice , -- these practice were just ; and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re so a powerful , <unk> and young girl , you &apos;re going to one one of those <unk> .
and if you can it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred . .
and of course , it was an easy trick from dr. <unk> , so i i i to do the i i wanted to to the the that that that that that that that that be five to to in the the in the the , , and it was a new to see a new and <unk> experience .
and i am asking to ask , how much of me very for a lot of and <unk> young girl , my self , and i could imagine , as a of nature from very strong , powerful powerful and <unk> .
this is just one example of many , adults , as adults can be to the imagination of a child .
but as the <unk> examples of the <unk> , , us our language , &apos;t make us to imagine what we would all want to to to to to each each one to to themselves as a .
our language is the social changes that they were in in many many cases , in a of a technological change .
from from looking at from looking at , of course , my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the body , that , to to their their , , to to their own way to to to groups that they to to to groups .
so maybe what this technological thing , more clearly because the most , because ever , there was always another truth , that , that every human has a bit of a and and very powerful , and the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus .
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story because people always telling me to tell me about how i i &apos;m to to , and i &apos;m going to say , i &apos;m going to feel very , , and i &apos;m going to feel like to ask people , i i understand .
this set of of of with <unk> lives in the idea that success or happiness , a challenge to , without without without the brain of that , , and i could be a a a a a a a a a , or always always me to a a .
but the truth is that we change us . of course , we are by the challenge , whether they &apos;re physically , , , , , or both both
and i &apos;m that that &apos;s good .
<unk> are not a obstacle that we need to to to to to our lives .
<unk> are just just our life .
and i tend to see <unk> as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that it &apos;s very present , sometimes it &apos;s not to see , but he &apos;s always all the time .
and i don &apos;t want to have any impact the impact of the the of of a human . .
there are <unk> and and challenges , and they are just <unk> real , and each person is really differently , but the question is not , whether we get to with <unk> , , but we get it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for that people people we love to keep the , , but they &apos;re going to to it .
and we we we &apos;t really to children , when we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt to . .
you have to separate two things : to the one the medical fact , and and the other of the other god that i i i is not .
and to be honest , the only real and permanent disability that i had to to apart apart , is that the world is constantly , , could describe me with these statement .
in our desire to protect people who are us , and and the the the the to trying to share the care of the care of the , or even a to to the quality of life that we &apos;re going to be that we &apos;re not actually able to make the the that that that somebody &apos;s .
maybe the the idea of the idea that that look at what what is in one , and how we fix it , for each individual , than the the the . .
if we &apos;re not treat a , , not all all of their forces and possibilities and understand , we we to the the the kind of fight that they might have to to to have a .
we have a a that has a value for our society .
so we need to to to the the the of the human possibilities .
but most most , but it &apos;s is that it &apos;s between our our and our our great <unk> , our our . .
we should not be this <unk> times , or or , , we should not try or to , , , we should go them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about the in the the .
it may be more about to realize that we don &apos;t have to overcome <unk> , but that we &apos;re open to the , , to to the to to the to to a a , and , and even it .
and maybe we do it to make it as a natural , , and and and and and feel so that they don &apos;t have to the presence of
we we we we the 200 . birthday of charles darwin and when he wrote about about 150 years ago , , darwin , in my eyes , in a very true human character .
i would be so call : not the most most of of survive , and not the the of of the , but the that can be best best .
conflicts of of of .
not just from darwin &apos;s piece of darwin , we know that the ability to survive and survival , the the of the human spirit is to turn itself .
so , again , change and adaptation are the greatest key skills of people .
and maybe we know , we we , we &apos;re a to , if we &apos;re really <unk> .
maybe exactly the is the sense of <unk> , , a perception of the , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something .
we can give a a new meaning that goes beyond difficult times .
maybe we can see <unk> as change .
<unk> are for a change that we don &apos;t have to .
i think the biggest damage that we have to ourselves , believe that we should be normal .
so , is is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual . the typical . but not the normal , but , and would you really know this poor , gray person , really know if they really would ?
i think rather , i think it &apos;s not .
it would be great if we &apos;re this paradigm of the , or the ways to make it even a little bit more dangerous , , , and we can can the forces of very lot of and and and and to to into society .
and , , we found that we &apos;ve been people from members of our society is always a to to be useful and a a .
there are evidence that the neanderthals , older years ago , older years ago , older years ago , people with with <unk> <unk> and that happened because the <unk> of of these people were <unk> to society .
they don &apos;t look at these people as as and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a couple of years ago i was in in the city where i grew up in a <unk> in in the red zone in pennsylvania , and i was there a a of a .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear a guy behind me , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i put up and see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , do we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you may &apos;t remember me to me .
when i first saw them , i was her her her her her her her . &quot;
oh , so .
and of course , it was made it .
this was dr. <unk> , a man i i i just me from from of my mother , because of course , i , , , very , to my birthday , late two weeks .
the doctor &apos;s <unk> , my mother &apos;s <unk> , my mother , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world , not not .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet went to them , and i just got some toes on this and and a of toes on the other foot , he was the <unk> , , was the <unk> , the the .
he said to me , &quot; i had to say your parents that you never could walk , and never could be be as a , or or you never have a a life , and they just just me lie . &quot;
i really thought was that he was <unk> <unk> my entire childhood , , whether i won a <unk> in the second class when i was to the <unk> , , , and he used these clips to teach his students , , and the school school school and the school medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> of the the the the of the human will .
you can just &apos;t emphasize enough of how the that that of the life can be .
and dr. <unk> told told , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that children , if you &apos;re not going to get something something something else , even even if you get kids yourself , you can get kids to be a lot . &quot;
you , dr. <unk> has changed .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how somebody learn to , two different things .
and i also asked my thinking about the time time , if you asked me by 15 15 years , i had <unk> <unk> from from meat and bone , , i would have no a second .
i i wanted to be normal .
if you ask me me today , i &apos;m not sure sure .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve experienced little little , my my my my , and i &apos;m &apos;t even even this experience .
and maybe that change could happen , because i &apos;ve been so many people that have open doors , instead instead of the people who wanted me to go me or me to a a idea .
you see , it takes a people who are them them how how they can their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to to to your own own own , , the , the human mind is so <unk> -- if you create this , and for someone in a a a a a moment , you &apos;re , they &apos;re a very good teacher .
they bring them to open themselves open open .
the real meaning of the <unk> &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the word &quot; . &quot;
it means something to that in one is that the potential potential .
again , which potential , do we want to get ? ?
in the 60s , in the the was done in a case , in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> into <unk> .
they call this &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the the we call this as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
students are going to notes .
and the a a <unk> <unk> <unk> , , the better , so so so so .
they &apos;ve been a a a of time , students students with a <unk> , &quot; the note , &quot; &quot; , &quot; they were be very , they were very smart , and after these three months , they really did &apos;t have <unk> .
and of course , it it it to to the heart that vice vice , was said , only enough .
and it was also the three months .
but only those who were still in school -- apart from the students who had school .
the the is the the that the the were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that it has changed .
you was been told that that the <unk> , and that are the students the the the , and they &apos;ve been something that they &apos;ve been been and they .
the only real disability is a <unk> spirit of a mind that was broken , no hope no more , he doesn &apos;t find any more <unk> , it , our our , , and our our our our our .
but if we can do it to support the human spirit of to , to to , to , and other people around around love , , be curious , and and , we we really make our forces in .
if a mind of the that these qualities , we can create a new and new new of . .
i i want to end with a poem that was written by a millimeter poet called <unk> , and my friend jacques <unk> &apos;s told my friend jacques <unk> , &quot; the god who knows the , , , he &apos;s just , , , he , , &quot; come to me . &quot;
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than they &apos;re right ?
suppose i said that , by a few changes of their genes could have a better memory -- more , , more , and faster .
or want to be more , , more more power .
do you want to more and more more ?
how would it be to live good health health health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who always always more more creativity .
what would you like to most ?
what would you like to have you if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would have creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see me .
some few . probably , as many as many people here there .
that &apos;s very good .
how many people would to to a ?
some more .
what about about ?
a couple .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to be like a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a different world .
is it all the ?
or is it possible possible ?
evolution is a a subject of the ted conference , but today i want to to give you the a doctor &apos;s a doctor &apos;s
the big geneticists in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was a <unk> in the russian <unk> , , he wrote a article , &quot; nothing in biology , nothing in the in the in the . . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who are not evidence evidence for biological biological evolution would be a very good at your <unk> , , you take your personal , , and you can , you , , , that &apos;s about , because it &apos;s a little of of this speech .
but if you accept biological evolution , you think , is it &apos;s just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it for other different or , it it &apos;s us ?
this is another view of life .
in this image , i have a bush when a center of the <unk> in all directions , because if you look at the edge of the tree , all existing <unk> on the the of of the , , they had to , they have survived ; it &apos;s <unk> and and strength .
the human part of this <unk> , , far , , of course , is what we &apos;re most are most .
we we from from a shared ancestors to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , maybe 20 or 25 different of of . .
some have come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years .
it seems like we we quite <unk> from the other of the other &apos;s tree , but actually , the most the , the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are pretty much .
is you clear that we can can can can and can can can can the the of a common bacteria a common bacteria to produce the protein of the human brain , which is used to treat ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that is is <unk> <unk> from what &apos;s coming out of the pancreas .
and in fact , we &apos;ve talked about bacteria , is you realize that all of us in our gut more more bacteria than than than cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , think , when antonio <unk> in their self , , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you will going to them the nutrients that they could only be without the effort .
it &apos;s really a easier way to bacteria , with <unk> <unk> of the , , , forced to the the .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as they are important to their lives .
they &apos;re helping to the <unk> of the , and they protect them against a .
but what will come in the future ?
are we in a kind of <unk> balance in a species ?
or are we going to be something else -- something that might be be much better to the environment ?
now , we go back to the time of the big bang , 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about a half billion years ago -- perhaps , the first <unk> of , , maybe the the of the , , and then the human species , which is the the the last <unk> years .
in this huge this of of the the universe , the is is just a , , the animal animal , like a single <unk> , and the human life , a small <unk> . .
we were .
this also also the the of of this speech , so i hope , you have it .
well , when i was a <unk> on college , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i , something very fundamental , , in most of life in in organisms , each cell , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell will going into both in both . .
but at the time , as a <unk> , , , , things started to change .
sexual <unk> comes into the picture .
and all , , with the introduction of sexual <unk> that the genome , the the the rest of the body .
in fact , you might say that the the of death of death of the in evolution in the same moment , the the of the .
now i i have to say , when i was a <unk> , i thought , okay , , for sex , death for sex -- it seemed pretty fine at the time , but every year , it has gone to my .
i came to to understand the the of george burns , who in las vegas , in the in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a <unk> on his <unk> .
he opens the door .
in front of him , a beautiful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and she looks at it and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; says , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup soup . &quot;
i came to the a doctor that i was a goal of a that was the goal of evolution -- not necessarily a , , , just different .
i tried to keep the body .
i wanted to keep it healthy .
i wanted to try to try health a disease .
i wanted to to to live a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the the of the genome on the next generation , <unk> and their generation .
from a evolutionary standpoint , you &apos;re and i created like <unk> <unk> <unk> to send the genetic <unk> into the next stage to to the the the the ocean .
i think we would all the the that the the of the the the the , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to to to by my work .
i want to get it by not die . &quot;
evolution isn &apos;t necessarily not necessarily to the longest life .
it &apos;s not necessarily the the most , the the , the fastest , and not even the the .
evolution <unk> the creatures that adapt to their environment .
it &apos;s the test of survival and success .
on the the ocean is the the the the the , the , and and the the the , or , , , you would have a a of fish , you , they have a a of a <unk> there to make a <unk> environment there for themselves .
so , what does that mean when we look back to what &apos;s in in evolution , and how we think about the space in the , and in the , and especially as we <unk> the the next phase , i would say that there are a series of possibilities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to go .
we &apos;ve made sort of balance .
and the reasons that would be that that it &apos;s all of the , , , , a lot of genes that had been been to be otherwise or or the population .
and secondly , we as a species , we we our environment so our environment that we &apos;ve done it to to us in the , and we &apos;re going to adapt to them .
and by the way , we go and and and and and we we to make us that that they can &apos;t be that that that is be for evolution , for evolution .
a second possibility is that it will be a evolution of traditional universe , of course , by by the forces of nature .
and the argument is that the wheels wheels is to be , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and so the isolation , if we &apos;re , as a species , a planet , it will be <unk> and the changes the change that can make evolution in natural natural .
but there &apos;s a third way to a , , , fascinating and intriguing opportunity .
i call it <unk> -- -- the new development that doesn &apos;t just just , but led to us as a <unk> in the decisions we do .
now , what could that happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s look at the reality that people people people doing in some cultures about their offspring .
they &apos;re , in some cultures that choice to have more men than women . women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and family .
so , think if it &apos;s not possible possible to choose the gender of their child , but also to the body to to the the brain that would cure diseases and we would going to to to .
what if they could do the genetic change , to or brain or alzheimer brain or or or or or or or or to to
wouldn &apos;t you want to to do it to make these change in their genes ?
if we &apos;re <unk> , , these kinds of changes will be possible possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost <unk> billion dollars .
now , the year , when it was finished in the same , they could the same for 20 million dollars in <unk> to four months .
today , you can a sequence of three billion of of the human genome in a price of about dollars 20,000 and in the space of about a week .
it won &apos;t take more long , to the reality that will be the $ 1,000 human genomes , and it will be increasingly available to everybody .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering the <unk> prize prize for francis <unk> and <unk> <unk> , two scientists who were to to to to the natural process of the to work and to to a a a a a a , , which is called <unk> <unk> . &quot;
a few years ago , the <unk> <unk> was for for for for his research for his research he took a a <unk> , , and and the the of the the of the the , to to a a of , , a cell to be able to be any cell in your body .
these are are in in .
the same technology that that the human insulin into bacteria that are making viruses that doesn &apos;t only protect themselves , but to the to the other viruses .
whether it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the in the <unk> in the cells in the cells of a <unk> .
can you imagine something good thing that comes from ? ?
this is all reality reality and and in the future will be much more possible .
now , think about two other of other things .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the descendants of their descendants ?
what if they could the the and <unk> the <unk> <unk> , the might change the to a better chance to give their kids a a better chance of a life -- <unk> of diabetes , the the the of cancer of cancer ?
who don &apos;t want to get a number of
and then the <unk> of the the same engine of science that the the of the to to to disease , to prevent us to , , to , , , <unk> , <unk> , the better memory .
why don &apos;t the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , , especially if you can get it to the next generation generation ?
why not the the the that have to be able to be able to run faster and and longer ?
why no longer live ?
they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
and if we can go on a place where we can give it to the next generation , and we can adopt the the of that we we &apos;re going to be <unk> by <unk> evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that which may have 100,000 years , and we can predict it on a thousand years , and perhaps even the the next 100 years .
these are decisions with their grandchildren , or their grandchildren are to to be .
we we use these decisions to forms that is better , the more successful , the more more is more ?
or will we be to different different ways that we want to have for some of us and not for others of us ?
will we get a society society and and and and and and and ?
these are the kinds of questions we need to be .
and the most about all , we ever ever be able to develop the wisdom wisdom , the wisdom of the we need to be to make that make this decisions ?
in the good good like in , and you used to be thinking , they &apos;re going to be these decisions .
thank you .
i want you to imagine something , a a , , that gives you <unk> skills , , or another , which is helping to stand up and go up and go up .
we at berkeley <unk> , we call this robot <unk> .
they &apos;re nothing something that you put in the morning and and and and , and the to the the speed , and will will help you to to to the balance .
this is actually the true extraordinary man of and machine .
but not only that -- and connect together and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
so to show you now , we &apos;re working on , we start to talk about the american soldiers , who &apos;s about 100 pounds on its back , and it &apos;s the that they &apos;re to to carry more equipment .
of course , this is a some major changes -- <unk> , 30 percent of them -- <unk> <unk> .
so we we we we would think we would think of this challenge and create a <unk> that would help with this problem with this problem .
so let me imagine you now -- or the human universal <unk> <unk> .
soldier : with the <unk> , i can wear 200 pounds of over <unk> terrain , many hours .
his flexible design enables to to to and to and and and <unk> .
it feels what i want to do where i want to go and then then my strength and resilience .
we are far around our our of our <unk> , this new <unk> of this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s take our look at the the , , something that i i think about very bad . .
there are 68 million people in the the the in the wheelchair .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
and we often talk about a lot of <unk> with the cord of the <unk> of the <unk> of of their life -- 20s , &apos; 30s , &apos; &apos; -- the the and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the population of the , their number of .
and quite the only option -- if it &apos;s a <unk> , or , for other complications -- the wheelchair .
and so it &apos;s been since since the , since his , , , i have to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a a new chapter in the area .
so let me imagine you now , which is is is is , , 19 years ago , a a <unk> that has been the the result that they couldn &apos;t run more 19 years and and until now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda is our our <unk> .
it has sensors .
his completely <unk> sensors in the crutches , the signals to our <unk> , , which is on on on your back .
here &apos;s also <unk> , the <unk> is is on your <unk> , as as as their <unk> , they move forward to this , and very natural and very natural . .
i was 24 years old , and in <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> me .
at a fraction of a second , i lost each and and each other underneath my <unk> .
it &apos;s not a long after after it , a doctor , my <unk> , and he said , &quot; amanda , you can never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 19 years ago .
he &apos;s steel from from of my mind .
<unk> technologies have been going to to to to get back to get to , and they get to the hands .
but nothing was invented to me me to go back .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet us and discuss them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the the potential to change life , to the future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda , and all the the , , but for all .
thank you .
in home in new york , i &apos;m the <unk> of a a of a a called robin .
if i &apos;m not <unk> the poverty , i &apos;m a a <unk> of a a , a a .
now , in our city , the volunteers have <unk> <unk> , , you have to be pretty early on the <unk> to to be <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteers at the <unk> , , i had quite good opportunities to able to get in .
but it was still a race to to the to the to the <unk> <unk> and find out what what our tasks would be .
when i found the <unk> , he had just found in a very serious conversation with the <unk> , who was certainly one of the worst days of their life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she was in the <unk> and and on a screen outside the <unk> rain , while her house was . .
the other volunteers that was just with me -- we call call it <unk> <unk> -- first , the the first , first , and was asked to go into the house and asked the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was <unk> <unk> .
there was any lawyer or <unk> , who was now for the rest of his life , people could tell us that he went to a <unk> house to save a living , , because he was five seconds faster than i .
well , i was the next .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> me .
he said , &quot; &quot; , , you have to go into the house .
you have to go up , the fire , , and , and have to get a a few of shoes . &quot;
i swear it .
now , not exactly what i had that i i would , , but i went up -- the up the the , the the , the &quot; real &quot; <unk> , which was going to the the in the in the bedroom in the bedroom .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was in my prey back to the , where i i <unk> my <unk> and i i met the loved dog .
we put our our out to the <unk> , , , , , not surprising , his much more than than my .
a few weeks later , the <unk> <unk> got a letter letter to the the <unk> of the the while they were their house .
one of all the <unk> were kindness : somebody had a a a of shoes .
in my job in robin , as as as a <unk> , a <unk> , i i <unk> in and kindness of a big scale , but i also see the changes and the and the of the .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i &apos;m in this room and and see people that have have a a success success success , or on your way there , i want to give ... that &apos;s not .
wait not wait for a difference in life , until you &apos;ve reached their first first .
if you have something , you give it it .
they them in a <unk> , , you a park park in the neighborhood .
be an mentor .
not every day , we we can offer us a chance to save a people , but every day , us us to change one .
so they go go ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just come back from a community that which knows the secret of humanity &apos;s <unk> .
a place where women women do the <unk> sex &apos; sex &apos; sex &apos; and the game is -- where fun is a serious matter .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> to get <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , your <unk> .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the of congo .
bonobos are together with our our our living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestors , an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this this of of the in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos showing the other side of the
during chimpanzees , of <unk> , <unk> , , , the <unk> of the <unk> of the .
they really come up with because that leads to a very <unk> society , that &apos;s is not been in .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least known <unk> in the primates .
they live in the deep deep , and , and it &apos;s the the is is to be it .
congo is a paradox -- a country of remarkable biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the dark itself -- the the of a violent debate for decades and almost almost so many lives as many lives world world world war .
it doesn &apos;t surprised that these destruction are the the the the .
and and the decline of the <unk> that that you could fill in a <unk> <unk> the <unk> bonobos -- and there are not sure , to be honest .
and yet , in this country violence and chaos , you can hear a <unk> laugh that the trees . .
who are these relatives ?
we know it as &quot; love rather than love war , because they have <unk> , , <unk> sex with <unk> partners , and and and and and and social and social . .
i &apos;m not saying that , that would be the the in all the humanitarian -- because the bonobos is made from more than the <unk> . .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play their life .
it &apos;s not just <unk> .
for us , and it &apos;s a very , of the connection of relationships and care of tolerance .
we we &apos;re learning and the the rules of the game .
it becomes a creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the the of of diversity -- diversity of the , diversity of the , diversity of connections .
and when you see the bonobos , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance and and and of rituals .
it &apos;s the <unk> that &apos;s us us .
well , i don &apos;t know about play , but i want to to show you some couple of some couple of of them from the wild .
first of a <unk> <unk> -- -- and i don &apos;t think in <unk> .
so here we &apos;re a a young female and males in a <unk> . .
look at what it makes .
it could be the evolutionary origin of &quot; she she takes him up to eggs . &quot;
just i think it &apos;s like it , not it , .
yes !
so <unk> are <unk> both both and and and and .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this is really interesting , because it shows the <unk> that will be the new elements of the -- -- -- and also how the game is also -- as it &apos;s a difference for it .
but the game is a <unk> . .
it &apos;s a <unk> , and there can think of some of of some of , , some more , , , , , , , to to to again .
and i want to show you , this is <unk> , a a a female , and she plays a with with water .
i think think just as you play , and we &apos;re alone , and we are the limitations of our inner worlds .
and it &apos;s these physics that that us we &apos;re us and interact interact , and the unexpected that we form , are real <unk> of creativity .
this is just a little <unk> of the the , the bonobos us to our past and present .
but they also also a secret to our future , a future where we have to to to of out of human challenges , greater creativity and <unk> education .
the secret is that the game is the key to this skills .
in other words , it &apos;s our <unk> .
to order to order to order to order to be in a <unk> world , we have to play .
but will we going to do the best of our <unk> ?
now isn &apos;t silly .
it is essential .
for bonobos and people are not people people are not people and and and claws alone .
just if it seemed seemed to be , maybe the game is the .
and so , my <unk> , , let &apos;s give us this gift of evolution and play in together , as we the creativity and the the and the wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two couples , in 1979 , at exactly the same day , at the same moment , every <unk> baby -- okay .
so two couples , every <unk> a baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to go too much time time to imagine the <unk> , because if you &apos;re the the the time , they won &apos;t listen to me .
now , think of this for a moment .
and in this scenario , you , that in a case , a <unk> <unk> , that that &apos;s on the x chromosome of the <unk> .
and in the other case , the <unk> of a x chromosome that comes on the x chromosome of the <unk> .
both are both <unk> , both of .
we &apos;re getting back to these people .
most most of my i i have two <unk> .
under a hat , i am with the history of the anatomy .
i &apos;m studied <unk> , and in this case , i study , people with anatomy -- that means human body , body , body -- how to <unk> with <unk> , with <unk> ; they thought about body .
the other hat i took up my work is the activist , as a <unk> , -- or , as sometimes say , as a a lawyer -- of people who who patients patients patients .
in this case , i worked with people who have the <unk> the the the the , the .
so , for example , i worked with people who are <unk> twins , two people in a body .
i worked with with with people with <unk> -- people who were smaller than common .
and very often i worked with with people who are <unk> who are <unk> the gender <unk> -- people who have not have the average male or or female <unk> .
and as general , we can use the word <unk> .
<unk> is in a lot of different forms .
i just give you a few examples of the guys of <unk> , which is not the male or female standard .
in one case you might have a a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of the y leaves the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> that we all all all to to their .
and that &apos;s why the the in the <unk> stage stage .
but because that individual , the the are lack the , to recognize testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t do on testosterone .
and this is called <unk> .
so a lot testosterone , but not reaction to it .
as a result , the body has more the the of the the .
if the child is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s brought up as a girl .
but it takes the as until they reached puberty and her their and grow their their , but they don &apos;t get their period until someone else is something different .
and they make a few tests and find out that they and and , , and , , in really and and they &apos;re an y chromosome .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could be that person for actually , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , in our body something called <unk> .
they &apos;re in in the back part of our body .
and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which are <unk> hormones .
most women , as i -- i think a a a to be a a , -- i don &apos;t know know , i i i probably probably the the typical -- most women women like i i actually talk to .
we produce <unk> and we &apos;re talking to <unk> .
the result is that someone like i actually actually a brain that more <unk> , was to be , a woman who was born with their , and a a <unk> .
so gender is really complicated ; <unk> are not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can be across the whole bandwidth .
another example : a couple of years ago , i got a husband &apos;s call old old years old who was born boy , boy , he had a friend , who had a friend with his friend , who was he was , he was he was he was <unk> and a a .
he had an <unk> form of an <unk> .
he has <unk> <unk> , and in the womb , his <unk> was so so active that that they have a male <unk> .
and as a consequence , his <unk> <unk> , his brain was <unk> the <unk> male male part of the <unk> .
and when he was born , he saw like a boy -- no one was something .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because it was up inside of the , that doctors were found that the doctors was that the the . female .
okay , just a quick example of a of of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , developing a , which is called <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so gender can have in many different sorts of different kinds .
the reason why the kids with this kind of body -- it &apos;s <unk> or <unk> twins , it &apos;s <unk> -- from surgeons often become the norm , not because this is for for the physical health of advantage .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why are often been done in many different ways of , , , because they would to to our social categories .
typically our system is the the that a particular a of of a a of a a of a .
so we have the concept that a woman is to to have an girl , an with a a a a a , means means to have an african anatomy in terms of the story .
so we have this awful <unk> idea .
and when we get with a body , actually , for us , something very different , , is really confused us to these .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about <unk> .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now you can imagine how amazing it is , if kids are born , the two people in a body .
where i had the most of the most excited , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> year , who in the gender world in in in in in in berlin .
many journalists call call me with the question , &quot; what , what , what would you say that tells you whether <unk> <unk> female or or male ? &quot;
and i had to tell journalists journalists that there &apos;s &apos;t .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature don &apos;t &apos;t to us between the and female and female and female and female and female and female and <unk> , we are that that course of course , as course .
so we have a situation where , the data , our science , we we have to to that that that that we were for a of , categories , which are very simple <unk> of making permanent <unk> , , much more <unk> , than we have .
and this is not just in on gender .
it also true with the species , which it turns out as much more complicated than our our <unk> .
in our we we we we all the kinds of areas .
we we think in the fact that we we &apos;re at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what should we start to the the that we &apos;re us from of a few of of a few of ?
as we move our science , we &apos;re going to move into a zone of the <unk> , where we have to recognize that the most <unk> categories we we we have too too .
we see that in all kinds of areas of human life .
one of the areas where we see that to the the , in in the culture , in the united states today , the the the the the the the the the beginning of life .
we have a significant talking about what point of what point is a to people , so it &apos;s a different right as the value .
we have very difficult <unk> today -- maybe not as public in medicine -- the question of when someone &apos;s dead .
our ancestors had never been hard to to to the question when someone was dead .
you &apos;ve got a <unk> to a a to just the nose , and if they moved , they didn &apos;t get it .
if you were not going to it , you get buried .
but today we &apos;re in a situation where we have people to take people to and and to their other people .
and as a result , we a a , we really really a hard question when someone &apos;s dead , and that brings us to a really difficult to that we we &apos;t have so simple categories like
now you might think that the whole end of the categories of said me me happy .
i &apos;m politically <unk> , i &apos;m <unk> people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it &apos;s me nervous .
to understand that these categories are much more than than we thought , me .
and it &apos;s me to to the to the democracy .
so to tell you about this <unk> , , i i to first , i i i &apos;m a big fan of the . .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i think they were so much and strong , and so radical , what they did doing , and the the of the the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happened to the the <unk> .
the fathers were from my view of the , , , , , and that &apos;s why .
what she was a <unk> concept , and they were it it through another that &apos;s radical and beautiful , and 200 for us .
as you all remember , our our our our the the the the of the , and the the the the in a very very kind of anatomy .
the <unk> of the old world did not have a concept based on dna , but they had a concept of the . .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who people who have political power , to have to have the the <unk> <unk> of the grandfather to the father , and so on .
the the <unk> the the , and and they were able to do through a new <unk> concept , and this concept said that all the people were are .
they <unk> the the and and decided that that that that the common , , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they did that part part because it were part of a <unk> system , in two things together .
the democracy was up , but at the same time , the science .
if you look at the history of the , , clear that many of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a world .
they went away from explanations <unk> , and things things like a <unk> concept of power , back where the transmission is based on a very <unk> of of <unk> .
they moved to a a concept .
and so , you look at the <unk> , , they &apos;re talking about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature nature .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of it were a a concept of the common common .
and so they have been prepared for the future civil rights .
they didn &apos;t think that way , but what they did for us , great .
so what happened years after that ?
for example , women women who the the <unk> , the the concept of the , , which is that that is more important than the the -- and and , &quot; we we have a <unk> and and , , the the , , , , , , etc . etc . etc .
and women <unk> that successful .
next next , the the successful rights rights , where we saw humans like <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s <unk> , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we &apos;re men in the <unk> of of the <unk> of the <unk> , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , humans , human color that are in in in the rights , , , , , .
we see the same thing with the . .
of course , the problem is that , we &apos;re starting to look at all all the similarities , we start to start asking why we &apos;re certain <unk> .
now , you , , , i want to to to certain <unk> , , , in our culture .
i i want to to give a fish of a fish like a fish like a people .
i don &apos;t want to to take the anatomy from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should have to to to sex and to to to .
so there &apos;s some of the that that that for me , and that we think , and i think , to keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep them and and whether they &apos;re sense .
so let &apos;s get back to these two creatures that have been <unk> the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in the in the the same day .
let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , three months months , , , so she &apos;s born by june june .
<unk> , on the other hand , the <unk> , is born , he &apos;s born by by march in 1980 .
just because of the is , by the months months , , , , you all all kinds of <unk> -- three months before <unk> -- the right to to to to the right to drink .
<unk> has to wait for all of this , not because it actually has another different biological old , only because of the <unk> of his birth .
we find other other of of what their rights are .
<unk> , because you think that he is male -- although i didn &apos;t told you that he &apos;s <unk> -- because you think he &apos;s a , , he can be to , which is &apos;t have to worry .
maria white , , not in all states , the same the same , the <unk> of the , , , and the right .
<unk> <unk> can marry a woman , , but maria can only marry a woman in a few few number .
so we have these these <unk> categories are in many ways , and and .
and for me , the question : what are we going to do , our science makes our science in the in the in the health , that we need to to to that a that that is going to be in in anatomy ,
i don &apos;t want to give science science , but at the same time , sometimes it feels like the science is being himself .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture , our culture , take a kind of a , , &quot; well , we have to pull a line , so we pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people are in in a very strange position .
so for example , texas &apos;s in a point decided to get a man who who is a a a <unk> chromosome , and a woman to married , to get a a chromosome .
now , in the practice , people are not tested in their . .
but it &apos;s also bizarre , because of history that i told you about about about the .
when we look at the of of modern of , dr. martin luther king , he gives us in his &quot; i i have a dream talk about a .
he says , we should not say to people , &quot; your skin skin , but then the the of the character , and goes out about anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a good idea . &quot;
but how do you do it in the practice .
how do you do people of their <unk> ?
i i want to to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we &apos;re to to so all in people , because i have to admit that i have a a of golden <unk> that probably make more more more more more more than some people i know .
i want to to be some some some some some some some of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and more sophisticated decisions about their sexual relationships , some of the <unk> that i know .
so how do we have the question of the the of the character ?
it turns out it it it really difficult .
and part of me , what if the content of a personality would something that would be in the future -- using <unk> <unk> ?
do we really want to go to this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure that we go .
what i know is that it really important to think about the idea that the united states is in the to do about democracy about democracy .
in our our to democracy , we we did well well , and i think we &apos;d do well in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation of how it &apos;s in iran , where a man who was being to to other other men , which was <unk> with the , , it &apos;s ready to be a <unk> , , where he could live life .
states don &apos;t exist in the way .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have those states -- a surgeon that i spoke to a couple of years ago , who had a few <unk> twins with <unk> to to them , part to make them .
but when i asked him , and he asked him why he made this surgeries -- it was high <unk> surgeries -- his answer that in his country , these kids would be really treated very bad , and he had to do it .
i i him , &quot; well , have you moved to political political in in a , instead of a surgery to separate it ? &quot;
the united states to have to be to to to people who are without without the state will change .
so i think we have to be an .
well , just to just just to just want to notice that i &apos;ve been a lot about the fathers .
and i want to to think about the ways of how democracy could be , or looked like , if we had the mothers .
and i want to tell something that is a a of a a , , and i think that there might be different ways of of of the of the anatomy , , , when people use a <unk> .
for years , since i &apos;ve been interested in <unk> , i i was interested in in research in the in the .
and one of the things that i really really interesting interesting is the difference between men and women in in ways , how they think and in in the world .
what we &apos;ve taught from <unk> studies is that women , on average -- not every -- but but in average , that tend to have social relationships and the care of people who are are are very , very lot of attention .
and so , we we think about this , we have an interesting situation to us .
and years ago when i was a graduate school , asked me one of my favorite that was started to know , i me as as a feminist , so it &apos;s like a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what what is the is female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the first question i ever ever heard .
in , it &apos;s about stereotypes about gender , so that &apos;s not a female .
but the more i thought thinking about about the question , i thought that there could be something <unk> of .
this is to be able to be something , on average , which women of the many of us , which us us to <unk> social relationships , and and <unk> for for the . .
so where the fathers were extremely extremely to figure out how individuals could be protected , the state , it &apos;s possible that when we put more mothers into this concept , we &apos;re more a concept of a concept of not just how to push , but how we do to other .
and perhaps it &apos;s where we have to go to the future , when we &apos;re democracy about anatomy about anatomy -- less about the individual body to think about the and and to think about relationships .
so , when we &apos;re trying to make a a of a a , we we can think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i &apos;m going to you what i &apos;m going to do , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and this is : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love to to to a a little bit of , kind of crazy <unk> , , and and and to to and and to them .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes from <unk> <unk> and <unk> in <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce my <unk> of my <unk> the environment and the the environment and my my .
i &apos;m all all kinds of great people , and i &apos;m going to have a good purpose , i &apos;m quite unique , and it &apos;s a to to to my very personal <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it be my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if if you answer the answers , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i tell you what i &apos;ve done for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does somebody with with so many of with ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought me seven of the <unk> , and that &apos;s all .
<unk> for a week , all of the i did in my suitcase .
i i i i i everything i wanted to wear , if i &apos;d come to palm springs .
and since you &apos;re not heard of me as the woman who &apos;s around at the in in my , , , that i &apos;ve found a few things .
and i just want to show you my my my of this week .
does it good ?
as i do that , i &apos;m going to you some of the lessons i i that you believe it or not , from these <unk> , , not to .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the the tiger tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost be very great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole <unk> , including the one &apos;s to 55 55 , and it was the most most sort of of that i was carried over over this
monday : color is a little bit powerful .
it &apos;s almost <unk> impossible to be bad , , you you &apos;re a pants pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation is totally <unk> .
i spent a lot of time in life , trying to try and to to to to the same time .
just be who you are .
if you surrounded with the right people , they will not just understand it , you &apos;ll also .
wednesday : hug your your your inner child .
sometimes say me , people say , i saw like i i , or i i remember her her .
i &apos;m to to talk to say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
<unk> : confidence is the key .
if you think , you look well , it &apos;s almost sure it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think they &apos;re not good good well , you probably probably right .
i grew up with a mother that taught me day day .
but only when i was 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i will going to it for you .
if you think that you &apos;re inside the and outside the a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing they can &apos;t carry .
so there &apos;s no sorry sorry for anyone here in this audience .
we should be able to <unk> everything that we want .
thank you .
so friday : a universal truth -- five words , a golden <unk> .
and finally , saturday , a , unique , , , , is a great way to tell the world to tell you a a word without a a word .
it was always been and over and over again , when people came to me , just because of what i was , and i had great conversations .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to be in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home , i &apos;ll going to give it all back .
because the lesson i i to learn to learn this week , it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t need to be these these these these these , because the the corner , it always will always be another kind of crazy , <unk> , , that that just me me , when i love a little , and it &apos;s looking .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good day , all all together .
i i &apos;ve something i i want to show you .
think of this as a <unk> flying , flying .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about this .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally , , and every boy in in in in in in , in the picture in the picture , but the reason i &apos;m show you this is that in the the of the in the last decades .
some time , , if you wanted to win a formula to a , they took their and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and when the car and the driver were good enough , they won won &apos;t go to run .
now , you , you , if you want to win a race , something like this -- something that car in in time , a couple thousand sensors , the information to the the system and then then and and and and and and and to change things in real time .
this would you would call it , in <unk> , a <unk> . .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that made from two parts -- a a part of a and a a .
what &apos;s interesting today is the <unk> is to to in our lives .
our cities , in the last few years , just in with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to be in the . .
and as computers , in the , they start to to in other way , they &apos;re seen and driven .
when we <unk> cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
just by the way , i want that that that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s earth , but 50 percent of the world population there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the <unk> -- -- to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so , if we do something about the cities , this is a big thing .
beyond the cities , the all of this and and and you can in objects of daily life .
this is from an exhibition , as as as as , for moma later , in the summer , in the summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
well , all of our objects , our environment , start to us back .
in a sense sense , it &apos;s almost as as the our is out there , a sensor , a a sensor .
and that changes radically the interaction that we have people with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost almost as the old dream of <unk> ...
you know , when charles shaped the moses , he means he he the the the the the and him him him , and they can still see a little of of -- -- and said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> ? why don &apos;t you you you ? &quot;
well , , it &apos;s the the the first time to to to answers .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and power and power .
let &apos;s start with the .
now the first project i i want to imagine is one of the first first in the of our lab .
it was a a in italy a year and a year .
and what we &apos;ve done , was actually a new kind of network that used used around the world -- this is a <unk> -- -- and and and and and information from this network that are collected by the , to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happier million -- 2006 .
it was the the the the the <unk> .
some of you will remember it was as italy italy as a italy , and then the end of the , the <unk> .
and no , italy .
now you see what happened to this day , the activity of activity that is happening in the network .
here you can see the city .
you see in the middle the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
the morning , the game .
you see the the the time .
and every afternoon , people here , and there , the phone calls and and .
the game begins to -- silence .
france is a gate . italy is an gate .
<unk> , people make a short call , go to a toilet .
second <unk> . the the of the .
first first , , second .
<unk> , in a moment of the <unk> .
italy win . yeah .
well , in this night , all all the to celebrate .
they saw the big <unk> .
the next day , all of the to the the the the the the and the prime minister to the time .
and then all down down .
you see the picture of the space <unk> <unk> , where the the time , the the time that people have go to to to a a big party , and you see see the the at the end of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we can can the city today , a way we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
there &apos;s another example , another example : it &apos;s not about people , but to do things that we use and consume .
now , we know everything that we we we do things .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that shows a mac computer , how they came together .
but we just know &apos;t know about where the things go .
so we actually designed some little map of this project to the garbage , as he goes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers , which we have us us more more than a year , in seattle have helped the things that you <unk> -- different types of things , as you can see -- things that you can .
then we have the little chips , the little brands , the the and and the waste and started to .
here are the results that we &apos;re just .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with this information , we realized there &apos;s a lot of <unk> of in the system .
we can do the same things in the more less energy .
the data has not available before .
but it &apos;s happening a lot of <unk> <unk> and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that when we see every day , the cup that we throw away , not simply , , that they &apos;re still on on the planet .
and the plastic plastic that we &apos;re always always always always there .
and if we would show that people , we can move it .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
my colleague at the , <unk> , , , could even more much more about the and many other wonderful things that can do with , , but i want to to talk to the second part that we &apos;ve to the the the , and that &apos;s the the
and the first project is something that we did a couple years ago in <unk> , spain .
it started with a question of the that came to us and said that spain and <unk> have a beautiful tradition in public places as a part of architecture architecture .
and the question was , how could you connect technology , technology ?
and one of the ideas that were in in a <unk> <unk> , , imagine that this , and , and , , , , , , they and they .
they creates as as a <unk> with with <unk> water .
if these <unk> can go down , you can write , you can , patterns , images , text .
and you can approach it , and it will open open to to you you can see it , as you can see on this picture .
well , we &apos;ve the mayor .
it &apos;s got it very much .
and we got to build the building a building in the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was of water .
there are no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it will open up and it will .
the roof was also covered with water .
and when it &apos;s <unk> , if you want to lower the , , you can even put the roof off .
or you could close the building and the the the architecture , in this case , you know , the the roof , you get the the of , they have pictures of people who were there , and they say , &quot; they &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t sing the building , it &apos;s just that architecture is almost itself .
here you see how the building works .
you see the person who are what happens inside .
and here you me when when i was when i was when i was the of sensors that opened the water , not get get .
now , i should tell you what was happened to the night when all of the disease didn &apos;t work .
but actually , it was a more greater fun .
all the kids from <unk> came to the building , because the way they were playing with the building was very different .
no longer a building that open up to to it , but a building that still still and and and holes in the water , you had to go to <unk> .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we think about how the people we use to design .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and this is the nice thing to create things that are used to interact with the people .
here &apos;s a picture of building the the physical <unk> , the the of water and the projections .
and this is what it brought to to the following the this project i &apos;m going to show you .
imagine that you could really start to fly into the .
imagine you could have little helicopter that fly through the air , and each of them with a little <unk> of light -- -- almost like a cloud can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like you you saw seen that other other , completely in in .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of <unk> screen or ad , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or , , in three dimensions , which is what changes , the light , not the position of the .
you can play with different different . .
imagine if you could just in the screen , in different <unk> or or , different different of .
but then it could only be a 3d cloud of <unk> , which you can go to and and they to move through that they can of many , many of many directions .
here you see a real <unk> system , the <unk> of the <unk> to of a <unk> . .
if you turn the light , it looks like this . so as we &apos;ve seen it before .
imagine that every single one of people being being being .
it could have a a a a that is of people people , from the movements of the people .
i i want to show you some bit of all .
we &apos;ve been working with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> in in the the theater in in in the and in in -- we we had in in 3d to use it as a as a as a as
here you see <unk> <unk> .
on the left side , you see the <unk> , , the different <unk> of . .
it &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> .
so that they can be able to that .
you can do that all the time .
but then , when we have all the the , , you can play and and and and and and play .
we &apos;d like to use as a a of perfect for the <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project project .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re in the the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
the idea is , , imagine imagine that we can bring people to do something and change the environment -- almost something like we call it , <unk> how to move a <unk> , , but with a cloud .
imagine that everyone can give a a a for a a .
i think that the remarkable remarkable of the the last last decades , which is the last decades that we are by by a physical digital world .
it &apos;s all all , , , and it it it through the internet .
now , we , we the first time -- and the campaign campaign has shown that -- can can from the digital world , from the digital forces of the networks in the physical world .
that can be in our case that we we use it to design and create a symbol .
that is what that is built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can to to the the to the the challenges -- think of the climate change , the emissions -- how can we change from digital digital world to the physical world .
so the idea is that we actually actually the people in which they together , , .
the cloud is again a cloud in <unk> , in the same way a real cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud cloud .
it &apos;s a physical of of in london , but with <unk> .
you can move inside and different different of of experiences .
you can actually see it from the bottom , the most most moments for <unk> 2012 and more and and it as the way to the community .
so , the the the the the the sky and something that you can go to the like new new <unk> .
you can go into .
and a of digital <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new way of the experience of the to the the top .
thank you .
so , as an artist , me , the context of important .
i &apos;m trying to express my work that people are not separated by nature and that it &apos;s all connected to each other .
the first time i was in a years ago , i i was the first <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
my heart , , my my , , while i was trying to find what was me .
the <unk> around me , almost 60 feet from the water , and i was just wonder that that was a a on a other a , year year .
<unk> <unk> born as a of a glacier or or by out of <unk> .
each iceberg has his own individual personality .
they interact interact with the environment , and their experience .
some are , up and <unk> to to the the , while while there never no longer more and and in a <unk> of a <unk> of passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you think they &apos;re very <unk> isolated , separate and just as as we often see us .
but the truth is far away from it .
as a perfect , , , i <unk> his <unk> atmosphere .
as the iceberg ice ice he puts drinking drinking drinking drinking drinking drinking drinking .
i go to my <unk> of this <unk> , i i i i to portraits of my ancestors , in that in that these individual moments moments , that , , and never be so
it &apos;s not a death when you melt it ; it &apos;s not a end , but it &apos;s a <unk> of of the life cycle . life cycle .
part of the ice in the <unk> that i &apos;m very young -- a couple thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last images i i want to show you show you a a , i i have in <unk> in in <unk> .
very rare , you actually actually witness a <unk> iceberg .
here you see here .
on the left side , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
please look at the form of the iceberg , and where it &apos;s on the the <unk> .
you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat has moved to other other side , the man is there .
this is the average size of a <unk> . .
it &apos;s about 120 feet feet feet feet , or 40 feet .
and this video is real time .
and just , , the the the the a other side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really extraordinary blessed through the of the projects .
but in the i i &apos;ve ever worked on , it was about this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> of the &apos; 80s .
then , one day , came back back and he said , &quot; <unk> , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the .
<unk> is is completely paralyzed .
he can only use his eyes .
i was him .
i have a company that power and animations , , , is is a a of a of a of what we we in in the art world .
so we decided to help tony -- -- -- and and his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and and , &quot; we &apos;ll give you to give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i want to talk to tony .
i just want to to him and i said , &quot; wait a moment , this is not -- i saw stephen hawking -- -- can &apos;t all the paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , just when you &apos;re heard about higher and and and a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not available available . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
anybody did the movie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; ?
so communicate -- so they &apos;re going to walk down your fingers .
i <unk> , &quot; very <unk> , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came to the need just just a check , and i i i i a check i didn &apos;t know the idea of the i i was him .
i i i to the place , and my his brother and his father -- &quot; -- &quot; good , my suggestion is like , , we &apos;re going to get a a , we &apos;ll find a way that it can make it again .
because it &apos;s a a that somebody that that it it in it , it cannot communicate . &quot;
so i was a a a a a conference .
i met these people from <unk> , <unk> <unk> , , and they have a technology that allows them to project , and to on any surface , and then to draw with a <unk> that that that &apos;s just the negative land .
so they move around and and make it <unk> like this .
they say that all the things that are on up there , the life life life .
it starts with the the , , the the <unk> , , and the the and and the people actually do art .
but there was always a cycle cycle in their stop .
so i went home and i had to with my wife and and i told her , , and we thought , &quot; well , second , if there &apos;s this technology that can can a a a that that can make a a that that would be a , that would be a . . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a a of organization and and a lot of things , we &apos;ve done some things .
first , we have the the to the the doors , and actually have a device for a device that can communicate with -- an stephen <unk> .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call it <unk> , because you talk to him , you know , you say , , , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
also , we &apos;ve taken seven programmers from the world -- literally from all the of the the of the world -- home .
my wife , my kids and i moved down into the garage , and these hacker and and and and and and <unk> and our house .
many of our friends thought that we were nice to do that and that we &apos;re <unk> and and all the images in the walls would be <unk> .
but for two weeks , we were we , we went to the <unk> , in , my children , my my dog , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought on the <unk> of , , something <unk> and some of things from the and and the .
we took a <unk> , , they have <unk> , , have you have a <unk> , and now we have a device that is accessible to it -- you can make it make it make the code for free you can download the code for free
so we have created a device that is completely free of constraints .
no insurance can <unk> .
no hospital .
so every <unk> can actually communicate with his eyes , and draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to <unk> room .
i love this image , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
now there &apos;s all of this <unk> of the great revelation .
and after one year , planning , two weeks , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , , tony , , he was going to seven years .
and this is an amazing picture because this is his life life life , and he sees the life life life life life .
we have his bed , so that he can see out .
we have a a on a a wall of the <unk> .
and he drew out for the first time , in the family of his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a lot of the on the parking lot .
and we had to be in the in the parking lot , we felt felt as as a of the <unk> .
and he was going to take an email that , , , &quot; for the first time , seven years , i &apos;ve been doing something .
i feel that i was going to and and , and finally , up and my my head down so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
this is something like our <unk> .
that &apos;s us us to the and and we &apos;re going to .
and we need to improve much lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a a <unk> .
and someone who has such a potential potential , it makes much more .
so we &apos;re doing to find out how to do it , faster and more stronger .
since that time we &apos;ve all all kinds of recognition .
we won a few prices .
remember , it &apos;s free , no one of us it it .
it &apos;s all all of our own pockets .
so the the , , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> about us and then , december , has been honored to us as one of the 50 best of in 2010 , which was really nice .
and the the is is -- and that &apos;s the all the circle -- that it &apos;s this april , in the in in the in the in los angeles , a show called the &quot; of the of the <unk> . &quot;
and there are probably be the the of the the the of the <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys are going to be there .
<unk> is part part of the show is a very <unk> .
so basically , i &apos;m about this : if you see something that &apos;s impossible , it it possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this computer , the microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible impossible .
do it possible -- you all of it .
i &apos;m not a programmer and i had never been doing with a <unk> , but i just just just and and with with amazing people with so we could have something to the .
and that question should be them , and this question of every single day that you have to that that has to be done . if not when , when not when , when not , if i didn &apos;t , who ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and i probably most most of most of most of <unk> .
and i always tell people people i &apos;m not like to come to a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody has ever chosen farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and and .
well , a is for usually , for a is that you you &apos;re there , you you .
you &apos;re about the block , it it as a revelation .
this is a painting painting an circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of very complicated circle i &apos;m going to tell you about you today .
my circle , in the &apos; 60s , in the &apos; 60s , in <unk> , ohio , where i was the <unk> .
i was the one who was a every week in the green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by asked me the in the the in the <unk> .
they did it .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go out of the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and i was up san francisco in california -- i found a a and and the back in the &apos; 80s , i found it a work at <unk> .
about three or four years ago , i got a phone call from the night , a phone call from that teacher , said , &quot; i have to see you .
i &apos;m sad that we have &apos;t know each other as adults .
can you come to ohio , and please come come together with the man i know that you &apos;ve got it .
and i should mention that i have <unk> , and i want you to be you . . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we we looked at them , we we , we , and we knew that they should be in a hospice .
we found one for you , we took them , and we took us to and we took on their family , eight because it was needed to .
it was something that we knew .
and just when the woman who who to know me as adults , to know , she turned into a box and and and was and put into my hands .
what happened was was that the circle had closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation of i was talking .
the revelation is that death is part of life .
she has saved my life , and my partner and i &apos;ll have her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything of the rest of life needs .
it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is so been mentioned .
it takes just like -- it takes , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to to to us .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion in front of you &apos;re up to 1,000 feet .
imagine a a an an an smoke .
imagine a a of a , , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , power .
it &apos;s <unk> fear .
well , i had a unique place in that day ; i was sitting on <unk> .
i was the only one who could talk to the <unk> .
so i looked at it same , and they said , &quot; no problem , we probably get some birds . &quot;
the pilot had already <unk> <unk> , and we were not that far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things are three things at the same time .
the pilot where the the the the the river .
it &apos;s not usually the route .
it turns out the . .
imagine a a <unk> plane .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words i ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> <unk> to the . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk with the <unk> .
i could see it in her eyes , it was completely , life was to end .
i i want to share three things that i learned to that day .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
we have this <unk> , we have these things we we to live in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to rich and didn &apos;t do , all the the that i wanted to do , all the those i wanted to do and never never .
while i was thinking about it , i was a saying , &quot; i &apos;m going bad good . . &quot;
because when the wine is far , and the is , , i i open it .
i never want to know more about life .
and that urgency , this goal , has changed my life .
the second thing i learned about that day -- and that was when we <unk> the george bridge , , so , a pretty much -- -- i thought , , , there &apos;s one thing i really really <unk> .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and my my , , i i to to , better , in everything i &apos;m going .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve been my latin , i was .
and i &apos;m the time i i have <unk> things for <unk> things with people who mean something .
and i thought to to the relationship with my wife , to people , to people .
and after i i thought i , i decided to to negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i i &apos;t have me me a little <unk> with my wife .
it feels amazing .
i &apos;m not trying to have right ; i i to to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and while the the the the the in the , &quot; 15 , 14 , 14 , 13 ,
you can see the water .
i said , &quot; please <unk> in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want that thing to be in 20 parts , as you know it from of . .
while we were out , , i had this feeling , , , to die not .
almost like we we get our our lives for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this sadness really , really , in one thought , that i just one thing i just one thing .
i just wish i could see my kids grow up grow .
so , a month after that , i went to a a of my daughter -- <unk> , not a lot of <unk> talent ...
... not yet .
and i <unk> , i have like a little kid .
and in the world , everything was a sense of me .
i was now , by the the around the the , that it &apos;s only about the a great father .
more than anything , everything else , my single goal in life , to be a good father .
i was been the miracle of the , that day .
i received another gift , which is to to to the future and come back and come back and come back .
my call to all of you today today , is the same thing happens on your flight -- please -- don &apos;t -- but do it , and how would you change ?
what would you do that they &apos;re it because you think they would always be there ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything , are they the best parents they can be be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> <unk> is is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want the iran to build bomb bomb .
the most most <unk> there is the the of nuclear weapons is the <unk> in <unk> .
the gray boxes that you see here , these are <unk> .
now , if we &apos;re going to work systems that are <unk> and the , , , we can actually create a lot of problems with the the .
these gray boxes are not running with <unk> ; they are based on a completely different technology .
but if we can do that that an effective <unk> <unk> on a laptop that &apos;s used by a <unk> , to <unk> this gray box , then we are in business .
and that is the planning behind .
so we start with a <unk> . .
the <unk> the the in the gray box , , the the and the and the iranian <unk> , <unk> -- on . .
this is a like , , right ?
i want to tell you how we &apos;ve this .
when we started our research in six months ago , it was very unknown , was very unknown , and purpose of this <unk> .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the the part of the , the <unk> part , he made made of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it seemed to be a little bit of , with these gray boxes , this <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> of our attention , and we started a a project that we infected our environment with <unk> , and and these these .
and then something weird happened .
<unk> &apos;s <unk> as a <unk> that didn &apos;t like our cheese -- <unk> , but didn &apos;t want to eat him .
that made no sense in my eyes .
and after we we actually actually , with various kinds of cheese , i went to me that this is an <unk> attack .
completely a particular goal .
the <unk> <unk> active active in the gray box , when a particular configuration was discovered , , even when the particular program that it &apos;s trying to try and it &apos;s trying to get it .
and if not , it &apos;s not doing nothing .
so , the really did my interest , and we started working with it , almost around the clock because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it might say , for example , we &apos;re an american american power power , or a <unk> in germany .
so we should be going to find out what the goal is .
so , we <unk> and we we the <unk> code , and found that it &apos;s in two digital , , , -- a smaller and a larger .
and we also had been that they were very very designed to people who are obviously all all the the information .
they knew all bits and <unk> that they they to attack .
they probably knew they were the the of of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve already noticed that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high-tech , you let me tell you : the <unk> are a science for . .
it &apos;s much more more than everything we &apos;ve ever seen .
this is a clip of this <unk> code .
we &apos;re talking about about about 15,000 lines code code .
looks quite like <unk> <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart this code .
so what we were looking for first , <unk> <unk> , because we know what this make .
and then we went to <unk> and and and and and , and trying to bring this with the real world in the in the real world .
so we needed to convince us about these goals that we could do or <unk> .
so to make this theories , we call us that it &apos;s definitely about <unk> <unk> , , it has to to act a a goal and and very , and it &apos;s very in iran because most infections were were . .
well , in this area , there are not several thousand . .
basically , it &apos;s out the <unk> nuclear nuclear power and the <unk> in <unk> .
so i said to my my , &quot; let me tell me a list of all the experts and plants and power plants . &quot;
and i called them , and i <unk> her knowledge to compare their their of what we had in the code and the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the small digital <unk> with the the <unk> of the .
the the is is moving moving across the , , , and they black object that you see .
and if you &apos;re the speed of this <unk> system , you &apos;re actually able to break the and and even even to the the .
what we &apos;ve found out is that the goal of the attack was to to , and and and , and to to to to the to to the , , that they &apos;t be able to be able to come out fast .
the big digital <unk> -- we got a view of a that we looked at very much and and <unk> .
so for instance , the number of <unk> is very out out of this code ; you can &apos;t missing it .
i started started scientific literature , as this <unk> of <unk> built in <unk> , and found that they &apos;re <unk> in what they &apos;re in in so-called <unk> , and each <unk> contains <unk>
so this made sense , it together .
and it &apos;s even better .
these <unk> in iran are going on in 15 so-called chemical .
and guess what we found in the the ? ?
it &apos;s an beautiful identical structure .
so again , that really really good .
and this gave us big confidence that that we &apos;ve studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , this wasn &apos;t just like that .
these are are these results were achieved by a young weeks .
and often often start to a end end , and we had to collect us .
anyway , we found that both the the in the digital in in reality , and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little <unk> takes a <unk> , and and <unk> the and and and and the the great <unk> , with with six <unk> of into interaction and <unk> .
so , in , and we &apos;re very confident that we actually have really what what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t worry worry worry that other can be met the other goals of <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- has really me out of the . .
there &apos;s the gray box down , the , and you see the the <unk> .
well , what thing is is that it &apos;s the the of sensors -- so , for , , and <unk> -- and and it &apos;s <unk> code that &apos;s in the , , the <unk> data , the wrong data .
and in fact , this wrong data is <unk> before before .
so it &apos;s just like in <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> with before the <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
now , the idea is obviously not just , the <unk> in the room .
in fact , it &apos;s even more dangerous and more . .
the idea is to <unk> a digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> where where a human <unk> can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so in a power power , for example , if the great <unk> is is to to be , you have to open up in of milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human <unk> .
so this is a digital <unk> .
and when it &apos;s at the , , really bad things can happen .
the power can will
and neither the <unk> , , the the is will notice it .
this is scary .
but it &apos;s worse .
and what i &apos;m going to say is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
he has nothing to do with with with with , with <unk> .
so he would be so well -- in a a power power in a power power .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the the -- -- you have to have the <unk> of the <unk> stick to a <unk> stick , like we saw it in <unk> .
you could also use ordinary <unk> technology to spread .
you have to be it as far as possible .
and when you do that , you get a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the consequence we need to make .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals for those attacks are not in the middle east .
it are in the united states , europe and japan .
so all these these these , these are the <unk> environments .
we need to make the consequences , and we &apos;re going to to to us .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it became a lot of that that people who think the the is the the .
is that that your mind ?
okay , you really want to know this ?
yeah . okay .
i think the <unk> is involved in the , , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the the that is the
there &apos;s only one , and that is the united states -- happiness , happiness , happiness .
because otherwise , our problem would be to be .
thank you for a <unk> <unk> . thanks darwin .
i spent spent the last few years years in situations that usually usually actually difficult and dangerous and dangerous .
i went to prison -- difficult .
i &apos;ve worked in a a <unk> -- dangerous .
i was in in <unk> -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days years , nothing as this -- -- at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i &apos;ve been the most of my career to <unk> situations , and all of the trying to take the , , and you &apos;re <unk> and interesting , and , and , and , and it &apos;s a kind of of , which makes it for the audience and accessible .
so when i knew that i was going to come here to see in a tedtalk in a tedtalk , i knew i knew i was something something different different .
some of you may have heard heard that a few weeks ago , i had an ad in ebay .
i just sent a few of , , some <unk> , , and i gave people the opportunity to <unk> my tedtalk in my tedtalk .
really , some happy people and companies , <unk> and <unk> , , got the perfect opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson got to to to the the talk , the time , not a a of the and many of the of the the of what the issue would be .
so what you got was , this : &quot; you &apos;re me the name : my tedtalk that you have no idea what the subject is going to be , and the the the the the , , especially if i put her her in their own .
but it &apos;s a very good media , , it &apos;s a very good media .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot .
that &apos;s just the <unk> .
so despite this , , i knew anybody would have the <unk> . .
if you &apos;d asked me this one year ago , i wouldn &apos;t be able to say you this .
but in the new project that i work working , my new film , we we the the world of marketing , the advertising .
as i said , i was going to some pretty terrible situations , and i could get work , nothing , nothing to me me to to anything so difficult and so difficult to go on the and as a of these guys .
you know , i had the idea of a movie .
what i want to do is a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing , marketing and advertising , the the film is going by <unk> <unk> , marketing and marketing .
and the film will going to &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot;
so what &apos;s in &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> is that everything , from down down to the the beginning , completely completely -- -- from the <unk> that you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand <unk> .
now this brand , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> center .
these people are being connected to the film in an , times .
and so the movie will this this whole idea of -- that &apos;s what ? in , , for it ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more on the on .
it was &quot; in , , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not going to be the x as a <unk> , , but we &apos;re going to be a bit of that we &apos;re going to sell every possible category in the movie .
so , we might sell a shoe , and it &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe that you ever used ...
the greatest car that you &apos;re ever the , out of &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; the greatest drink that you have had , a a of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is to show that that brands is part part of the life , actually to to to the the ?
and we actually actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning to end .
and i would be happy if <unk> would help to make this .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
but i don &apos;t know how <unk> people will be .
have you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use view of view , because this has a negative <unk> , -- -- but do you know how to do it ?
how much money is takes needed to realize it ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to make you , but i think it &apos;s worth worth of really really really really . .
who knows if the movie comes out , , we might see like a whole whole of of . .
what do you think how the answer is going to be ?
the answer is probably probably not be no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing to the movie or a hard thing to me ?
lc : both .
so , , not so optimistic .
so , my , , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about which brands .
yes .
if you look at the people who you have to do it ...
there are some places that we can can .
so , the camera &apos;s camera .
i thought , &quot; , &quot; imagine the camera &apos;s camera that we wanted to do a <unk> . .
it turns out it turns out , &quot; we want to do nothing to do with your film . &quot;
and just as these companies disappeared , one one after the other .
no one wanted to do anything with the film .
i was amazed .
they were absolutely to to do with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept idea idea of advertising , the the of as many as possible as possible as to can see as many people as possible .
especially in the world today , this this interface and old media media and the media media -- -- it &apos;s not the idea to be in this new exciting new new that that the has this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a <unk> mistake , and that was this one .
actually no , that &apos;s not the . .
that would have no problem . .
that would have been . .
but what what this picture is is a problem .
look , if you &apos;re about the <unk> <unk> , this is -- this is the first images that seems seems .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and <unk> to just discover and and and <unk> , immediately , , and to information , and to information , especially , the -- the the -- the the of the is the most .
you know , we &apos;re now a whole lot about transparency .
our politicians , our our , , our president says , even our our .
but when it &apos;s it that it &apos;s going to be done , something change something .
but why ? well , transparency is fear of -- like this strange bear bear , still <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and it &apos;s also a very risky .
what else , what else is more risky ?
a whole dish of <unk> <unk> .
this is very risky .
so when i started to talk to companies companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we only want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , and my father was me me about -- and and , and he &apos;s looking at me at this -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three history .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the the . .
but there &apos;s only one company , a was a to help us -- and it &apos;s because i know because i &apos;ve talking john bond and richard <unk> for years -- i i i i to to do it , i had to deal the the and and i me to the companies .
so what you suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- i was that if you start to talk to these companies , the idea of how your brand is going to be a a .
i have friends who make big big , giant <unk> , and i have friends friends who i do .
and my friends , the big , huge <unk> , , say that the the , their films are so successful , the the the <unk> that they have .
and then my friends who make little little <unk> , , &quot; well , how do we compete with these big , giant <unk> ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so , how are we going to see in the movie ?
so , when i do on the way , and always when i open the <unk> , you &apos;re going to see <unk> .
and every time i i can <unk> somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you down to calm .
so maybe you should be a little bit of this . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great <unk> . .
either &quot; <unk> fusion or a &quot; <unk> , &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be for for men as well as women , , , , or a stick , which is .
this is the <unk> . .
now , i can answer to questions and give them a <unk> . .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as they talked about the smaller films , we are a brand .
so we have not have as a budget like other other brands .
so , do things like this -- you know , people &apos;s people -- -- that &apos;s somehow why we &apos;re interested in .
with what words would you going to to ?
<unk> is <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
<unk> technology .
technology is not the way to describe something that somebody to the the .
we talk from <unk> , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh , &quot; is a great word that really really to something that really , to something that , , &quot; fighting smell
it &apos;s fresh fresh .
how can we keep them new , -- better fresh , more fresh , three .
these are a <unk> of .
and this is a <unk> . .
what about me ? what about the ?
i have to talk to the guy on the street that are like me , <unk> .
and they should tell me about my brand .
how would you brand your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like to really nice clothes .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> , except for the <unk> .
all right , what is the brand ?
unique .
i think the the , , the style that i have , &quot; is &quot; glamour glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , many of <unk> and and so stuff .
but usually i have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a , and and a .
if dan is a brand , he would probably be a classic <unk> .
man &apos;s the brand i &apos;m , i would say , <unk> fly .
woman 2 : part of part , part part , part of , -- i don &apos;t know .
man three : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell sell <unk> in the the world , the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
and 4 : my brand is fedex because i were <unk> .
man five : brand <unk> <unk> .
does that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> . .
i am tom .
now , we can &apos;t all be the <unk> , but i see see see the the of of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
and what what did it was that i needed to have a experts .
i needed somebody to go into my head , somebody who could really help me understand what you call the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and so i found a company called <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , , helped to discover these <unk> .
if you could do it for they could be able to help me .
you brought her pictures , , yes ?
i &apos;ve got that . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how that with your thoughts and feelings of it itself .
these are the people that my my my my .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world where you live in -- how people around around , the friends , the family , the way you live life , the work and so .
all of things come and and start to a place , and and i come to my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
next next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what &apos;s the idea that is the thoughts and feelings about yourself ?
it &apos;s like i like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are <unk> . i like weird things .
tell me about the why &quot; why &quot; why &quot; what is it what is it ?
what is the <unk> ? ? what are you in the ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about they &apos;re not .
what more , have you through through ?
-- that doesn &apos;t need to be afraid of the , of what kind of of , are you ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for their patience .
yes . now . well .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what it gets to .
and so there &apos;s a lot of crazy things .
the first thing i saw was that idea that their <unk> are two two separate two two two , -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> / <unk> brand .
the are very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a that .
and i think some of companies are going to focus on a strength , instead of both .
a lot of companies tend to -- and that is human nature -- to things that they &apos;re not safe , they &apos;re not be , , and they &apos;re going to be , and they they turn them into something positive , and that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
what other other other other other other
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can see here , , , , , , , <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
well , there are <unk> brands and <unk> brands , these things that come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty strong thing .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ?
if if if you ask them to describe their <unk> , , their <unk> , how would they be ?
you you a a ? ? are you something that gets blood in <unk> ?
or are they more more a ?
are you something that &apos;s a little little down , <unk> , more conservative ?
<unk> are things that are are , , fresh like the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> like <unk> <unk> , , , , , , , , , , , <unk> and <unk> like <unk> .
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are they <unk> and <unk> like <unk> ?
are they thinking , twice , <unk> , <unk> , , , like ? ?
are they <unk> , stable , <unk> , <unk> , , , , , like the dalai lama , or <unk> ?
in the the the the film , we had more than 500 companies that were up up and <unk> and and the &quot; no , they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they wanted to to do nothing with this film because they didn &apos;t have control , not control the the .
but will become 17 <unk> that were ready to give up control of control that who wanted to do with somebody who are doing to and and and and and and the things that we we can &apos;t have to tell stories that we would &apos;t have to support .
they &apos;re us to tell the story of the <unk> , as we tell the story in this film that you &apos;re used to use <unk> , to the the of of the brain , both and make advertising and
we went to sao paulo , where <unk> <unk> had been met .
in the whole city , since five years , no no , no poster , no no , no .
and we went to school school where companies are their way in in in schools , in in america .
the incredible incredible thing for me is that the projects i had got the of the i had the most great success , those are where i have with with things .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the the and they said that the may doesn &apos;t really have their interest in sense .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist .
i &apos;m going to work with it and a little different different , something that people think think that our view is ourselves .
and how was it for you ? what &apos;s it successful ?
well , the film film was been called the <unk> <unk> , , we can look at this .
according to <unk> , the first of the the first of january , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million million of of from this movie
this actually actually actually a a of two two .
this is just online -- no press , no tv .
the film hasn &apos;t been going .
there &apos;s not even there . there . no <unk> . .
it has not come out in other countries .
well , finally , the film has a very large more . .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every single <unk> that we were to to their customers , to the fingers .
something i think what i think is that if you &apos;re <unk> , , , risks that in in this risks .
i think if you get people from it , you get to to to failure .
i think that if you trained their employees to avoid risks , you prepared to get a a a profit .
i feel that we have to encourage people to to to take risks .
we have to encourage people to don &apos;t be afraid to have a lot of you might be <unk> .
finally , we , we should be the fear of the .
we should put the bear into the cage .
do you welcome the . . do you to risk .
each one a big <unk> of a , we &apos;re going to .
and finally , we should be transparency to be transparency .
today , more than ever , us a a bit of a .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk called &quot; &quot; they said said &quot; they said , &quot; my my friends of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> for the <unk> for the <unk> . ebay .
big data data is to to organizations around the world in the world .
<unk> &apos;s called &quot; hot they welcome to transparency . &quot;
thank you .
well , morgan , in the name of transparency , what is this is what happened to the <unk> ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i got a check , i put on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , a check in a <unk> to to to the next year .
my name is <unk> .
18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i <unk> to to and and and and and art , and my <unk> , , and i my <unk> , , , &quot; me .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> at and stories , i can tell you , 17 are very interesting museums are nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the . .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal perspective is very simple to this slide and access to access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great huge education -- -- i &apos;m not -- but i had a lot of museums and and that works .
when i traveled to visit and i started to and i started to a lot of .
and while for google , i tried to do this desire -- art to make -- -- to to with technology .
we then created a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and i tell you some interesting things that happened since the start .
so you just go to <unk> .
you can look around in all those museums here .
there &apos;s the <unk> , , the moma , the <unk> , the van , .
i even in one of my favorite , the the museum of of new york .
you get in two of it -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , is in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- <unk> , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you go around and and and . .
you want to be in the museum ?
open open the map , and jump them with a click .
in , you &apos;re , they want to end up the end of the end .
just further . a lot fun .
so , them .
thank you , but the best is still .
now i am a of my <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> . .
if the museum gave us the picture , you click it .
this is the one of the images .
these are all the .
those of you who are really interested in art , i can click -- but i click it .
this is one of the images that we we we we with called the called .
this image for example , about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you .
you can very easily in and and .
you see something here here .
i love that guy ; his expression is <unk> .
but then they want to come deep .
and so i started playing around around , and i found that there is something happening .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds . &quot;
i went close , and i realized realized that these children actually beat something .
i was a little bit about a , and i found met , and and actually found that it &apos;s a game called <unk> , which is a a to a a with a a .
it it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned about it .
to get close close to go , you can go to to the . .
just to give you the , , i i , so you see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best is is even -- in a second .
let &apos;s jump quickly back to moma , again in new york .
another one of me , <unk> .
so , heard about , of the , of the .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ? ?
and what if you want to see van &apos;s of this <unk> of this this ? ?
you can go in . you can really go into it .
i &apos;m going to zoom in a of my my of this image , until i really &apos;m in the . .
this is <unk> , probably never seen this before .
now i &apos;m going to show my my favorite function .
there are many other , but i &apos;m all the time .
this is really cool part , it &apos;s called the . .
each of them , everyone -- whether it &apos;s rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and and online , their own museum -- from all these images can put their own collection .
just , you go in -- and i created this , it &apos;s called the the of the -- they can <unk> .
this is the <unk> , in the <unk> .
you can have it all to , , your friends , and so a conversation start to do what you feel when they look at these . .
i think finally , , the main thing for me , that the little amazing things is not coming here .
you don &apos;t think of my me , i believe in the museums .
i i should not say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was a experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to be with with this digital medium of art , and they &apos;re safe online .
and the the biggest question that i asked , said , &quot; did you made this to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s to add the . .
that &apos;s what you . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided into two . .
that &apos;s the left half that &apos;s the obvious side , and then the right half that is the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of the the of the the , we could brain brain .
for example , this would be a one of the .
this would be a one that &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you brain that you on this scale ?
some of us may have may be for one of those extreme , but i think that most people in the audience , your brain , how we &apos;re the this -- with a high <unk> , which is in both in
it &apos;s not like they they both or or like that .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and so i see as one of the people , in common with most other experimental <unk> , who have a good of logic to add the complex ideas .
but at the same time , we need a great percentage to the the experiments .
how do we do this intuition ? well , we love to play it with things .
so we go out and and and and then look how it . and then we start to our our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the the that you &apos;ve developed over the years , probably probably that one thing can be at the same time .
i mean , it can be strange that a thing that thing that thing in two different places , but they were been in in this idea , they &apos;ve been developed .
i remember a a kid in playing on a <unk> . .
he was a a <unk> and not very good at it and and he fell constantly .
but i bet that it play a very valuable lesson , which is the great things don &apos;t just leave you , and they they &apos;re on in a point .
and this is a great <unk> model of the world , long , you don &apos;t have a <unk> .
it would be a terrible model for a <unk> , because they don &apos;t play with <unk> , , but with these little weird particles .
and if you play with their particles , you all all kinds of weird things -- how you fly directly through walls , or they can be in the same time in two different places .
and so they wrote all of all of these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the physics of the , a few years ago ; you took woman mechanics about the small , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need to to them to to the big everyday objects around us .
this didn &apos;t have my intuition , and that perhaps because i don not often not often with these particles .
well , i &apos;ll play games with you , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particles .
but my logical page , it didn &apos;t like it .
because if all of things things are things and all these these these these these rules of quantum mechanics , then not &apos;t &apos;t just to the rules
i don &apos;t see that should be that that should be that .
so i would feel better better with the whole thing , if we could somehow show that the <unk> of the quantum goes .
so i did a a couple of years ago , i was doing this .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that was in the <unk> <unk> .
so what we look at is a tiny computer chip chip .
and you can see this green point there in the middle .
this is the piece of the i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
here i i a little bit . we &apos;re looking right here in the center .
and here &apos;s a really large close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we look at is a little bit of metal metal , it &apos;s a a a and it &apos;s over the edge of the edge .
so i made this thing in similar to a a computer building a computer .
i went to a a clean room with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours of all the big devices .
for the last little bit of , i had to build my own machine -- to build this like a <unk> pool of a , and and the thing .
this thing has the ability to be the the the the of the <unk> , but it takes a little bit of help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how do it be on an full elevator ?
i mean , when i &apos;m on on the elevator , i &apos;m going to do all kinds of weird things , but then other people and i hear hear all all these things , because i don &apos;t want to to get it , , , , they &apos;re
quantum mechanics says that <unk> objects are objects .
the <unk> of for <unk> objects are not just people , but also the light that seems to them and the wind that you come up and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal , , , we had to to the the <unk> .
and we &apos;ve done this .
we off the light , we put it into a vacuum and <unk> the whole air , and it it almost almost to almost , on the on the , , the the of the metal , to to behavior .
so we measured his movement .
we found that it really moving moving .
so instead of it just quiet there , it &apos;s the way it was like <unk> , like this this -- like this -- like a <unk> and and together .
we we gave him a little push , we could could make it to to the same time and and , and -- something that is is is a thing .
so what i &apos;m just you just about is what truly fantastic .
what does it mean to the same time to and and and and &apos;t ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the <unk> of of atoms that are still there , and and the the same time , the same atoms and down the same .
just precise <unk> voices think it .
the rest of the time they &apos;re <unk> .
that means that every atom is the same time on two different places , which is that the whole piece of metal in in different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
that was worth me for all this this this this year in the clean room , because , , the <unk> between a individual atom and this piece of metal , is about the same the the the the the the the the and them .
so if a single atom can be in the same time in two different places , this piece of metal in in different places , why don &apos;t you ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my obvious thing is saying .
so , imagine you would be in several places , like , how would that feel ?
what would your minds to to your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we <unk> it , the light light and the the box , we saw that the single piece was always in a piece .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator in the is actually just only <unk> objects that are in a small room .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics tells that everything is connected to everything .
now , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more behind it , it &apos;s even deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who are , and that &apos;s the <unk> and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be to of how we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families think about where they live and work , you want to have the possibility of a a of different cities that we have all in in in in the .
right now , we &apos;re far from from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries , not even a single city that she would be .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re much more than it costs them .
so we could also get the world very simple with <unk> , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
now maybe it &apos;s be absurd for you , if you never even thought about new cities .
they just just to building those from homes on cities .
imagine of half of people people people who want to live in homes , they were already , the other of the other .
you could try to expand the capacity capacity of their .
but you know what you you to to to , in these homes and their and laws of laws to avoid even and and <unk> .
so it it turns out to be very hard to all this this <unk> . .
but you could go to a a new place , a completely new new , , the laws of the laws would build one and and not .
so i i proposed that governments governments create new surfaces that are enough to a city and give them a name : <unk> cities .
and later , i found that , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of a challenge of reform in
they knew that every year had lost up to over over thousand days of their country to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to be sure that these people can stay in their country and and exactly the same thing in the .
and this is a <unk> , , , , , , &quot; what happens when we <unk> a <unk> area of our country , we just just a message of the american message , and if people are going to go to and can can go to the the of of help to help to canada or america ? &quot;
in summer , in , , , was a a <unk> .
the next most <unk> elections , the <unk> <unk> in in a a , , and and and and and and and .
he asked <unk> <unk> to be his <unk> .
in the meantime , i prepared to a talk at tedglobal .
through improvement , try and and the study of consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of the city city .
the first point is the importance of laws laws , laws that determine you already have not have been able to deal with the . .
we &apos;re going new technology technology , but for progress , technology technology and and , and , and it &apos;s for laws that we out .
in 2010 , a a friend from guatemala sent to the link to the tedtalk .
again , it was <unk> .
they were going to call me .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s present the the head of our country ! &quot;
so we we in december of the <unk> of a hotels in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make the , as valuable that are much more of as much as they are .
and i used this chart to show how valuable <unk> is in a place like new york . remember that a area of a a of a 200 thousand dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , a a place in a case , a , , said , &quot; paul , &quot; maybe we might look at tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk asked in very simple form that a a city city is a place where the beginning of the country , a <unk> that which is the laws that can be there , and the the the opportunity to to either , either .
so i was asked by the president of the , who meant that we have to make this project that it &apos;s important , and that &apos;s the way that this is to get our land .
i was asked to come to and and and and and the the and three three and fifth of january .
so i thought another another with language , which is a graph like this , is to to to that if you want to make a lot value in a city , it needs to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch is the the the the the the the the that was built in <unk> .
the the airport was a a area of 100 <unk> .
so i tried to to the the of of the , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with an area of at least 1,000 <unk> .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
voice have all the <unk> .
the audience were very serious and attention .
the the of congress came to stage stage , said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you so much for your talk , but maybe we might see the tedtalk .
i have him here on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and you put the tedtalk .
and i came to the the line that a new city is new new possibilities .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be in in , rather than hundreds of miles away from the north .
and a new city also also new new for leaders .
the leaders government government would be in in the aid , , , they could benefit from their <unk> , that they would build the the laws for this charter and to the , that everybody can be trust that the charter is really . .
and the of of president <unk> was that the <unk> of the that i thought thought to be able to make the have a bit of and to be able to build this city , for all the parties in the , for many years , and and .
we &apos;re in an area .
this picture is this place .
it &apos;s sort of <unk> <unk> square .
and shortly after , , the the , , , they were for congress for a change of the constitution to have a <unk> of that that is for special <unk> .
in a country that was a a a there was a a of of congress was elected to to with a voice .
all the parties , all the <unk> of society , were . .
to be part of the constitution , but it has got to be ever ever ever ever ever .
in , february , it was been to to a a voice .
immediately after this choice between the 21st and , , , , a a of of about 30 <unk> of the the the of the world who were most interested in the in the business of the .
the one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new , , that built in south korea , <unk> big <unk> .
everything that you can see in this picture , within four years after it took four years years after it took to .
the other place that was very interested in the , is singapore .
it has already built two cities in china and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re basically think about it , it &apos;s where we &apos;re today .
you already have a <unk> , , and you &apos;re already these those surface for the second city .
it &apos;s already working on a way way that that that is to be , and it will be working by a external law .
a country has already offered his supreme court as as dish for the <unk> of the the of the .
and <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they even put together with .
one thing , as you already know , , there &apos;s been a , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
there are many of of that like to in in america , especially in a place in a place , and there are many people who would like to live there .
over the world , there are 700 million people who say they would like to live in a different place .
a million people out of latin latin america and and to the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to put their families , to work , sometimes , they &apos;re a single mothers who have to make enough money to make food and clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes , sometimes kids who try to find their parents to again , in some cases , a decade , since a decade decade .
so what is it for an idea to build a a very new new city ?
or even <unk> of these cities , or or hundreds of all over the world ?
so what is it for an idea to that that any family has a choice between several cities cities that in competition in competition ?
this is an idea that is worth worth worth .
my friends from my friends , i asked me , thank you ted .
do you know how many choices they make it in a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i recently , a survey there , and the average number of thousands and the average number of decisions , the <unk> of a typical americans in a day .
and also , was taken a study in the , which they saw the the .
and these scientists have just the different subjects these these of and and and the the of the time , and how much time they spend decisions decisions that are with with the issues .
and they found that an average ceo is in the week with <unk> tasks .
each of these issues were of of course , many , many , decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were 80 minutes or less .
just about 12 percent of their decisions she had an hour or more their time .
think about their own decisions .
you know how many of decisions are in the nine minutes of the in the in the of of
how good , do you think they are the decisions ?
today i want to talk about one of the largest <unk> of of our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about about problem about the problem and some kinds of solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions and i want to know your answers .
if i i you a question , you raise this , because i &apos;m blind , just the hand , you you &apos;re going to burn a calories .
otherwise , i i you , if i i tell you a question , and you answer , yeah , so , my first question is is , is you you ready to hear about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a <unk> at stanford university , i went to this very <unk> , , at least , he was really <unk> .
it was a shop , which was called the .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> . .
they had 250 different species of mustard and <unk> and and different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different types of water -- and that was a time when we &apos;ve actually had <unk> .
i loved it to this business ; but at a time , i was asked , , , well , what is it you never have something ?
here &apos;s the oil &apos;s . .
they had over 75 various types of oil , including those who were in in boxes that came from thousand years old . .
so i decided to visit the one one , and i asked the director , &quot; work works work , that they really give people all those possibilities to do all those possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up the the of tourists that came and usually have their cameras .
we decided to put an experiment with business , and we chose <unk> for our experiment .
here &apos;s your <unk> . .
they had <unk> different types of <unk> .
we &apos;ve a little little <unk> on the the the the the .
we have got to <unk> six different of of <unk> <unk> or <unk> 24 <unk> of , , and we looked at two things : first , i , what could do more people stand and try and try and
there are more people stand when it were 24 , about 60 percent than when it were six , about 40 percent .
and after that , we we the people of a of a a of a glass .
now we saw the possible effect .
people were were than than than it were 24 , just three percent actually a a glass .
people who were were were than six six , now we saw that 30 percent of you actually bought a glass of .
well , if you calculate it , people were the six times a glass of glass , who had six to the , when they had 24 .
well , to don &apos;t have to buy glass of a <unk> for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our -- but it turns out that the the <unk> is that that &apos;s also to us .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even when our own best interests .
so , the the the of day .
i &apos;m going to give you a study that i i <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we made the decisions of the of of millions of millions of tens of 60 plans in the the united states
and what we looked at was was the number of <unk> that were a <unk> <unk> , the <unk> plan , the probability that is that is is for tomorrow .
and what we found is that there was a context .
so in those plans , we had about <unk> plans that have something to have something to to the people to two to two to the different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund were have been that , in the , the the .
if you look at the extreme , the plans that have two fund , , had a <unk> in in the 70s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that almost almost 60 fund , the <unk> <unk> on about the <unk> . .
now turns out that even if they were to to to , , even more opportunities , even , it has negative consequences .
so the people who would be participate in , to more more more ways you were there , the more they they the the and to to .
the more more possibilities you have , they were , they they they put their all their their for the .
none of these extremes decisions , that that who would recommend somebody who would if you &apos;re your future <unk> of well-being .
well in the last decade , we &apos;ve seen three of the very bad negative consequences that that that that that together together and more choices .
they put the decision -- -- -- you , , when it &apos;s to own best cells .
they make more worse decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re more more for things that you make themselves less happy , even if they make it objective .
the reason reason is this is that we we we we we we have to be this huge of of of of <unk> , mustard and <unk> and <unk> , but we can &apos;t in the to go and and and and and actually come out of the fantastic supply .
so what i want to suggest to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we tested in different ways and and different <unk> -- -- they can just use in your business .
first first thing .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true more than today that less more .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot;
they always always worried that they lose .
but in fact , we &apos;re seeing it more and more that if you &apos;re willing to be to just , and the <unk> <unk> possibilities , now , there &apos;s a rise rise of the , , it &apos;s the cost , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s a improvement in the
as a <unk> , and and the different of the and and <unk> of the 15 to 15 down 15 , , they were a a of of about 10 percent .
when the golden <unk> <unk> you were their 10 to the <unk> , they were they that the profit of percent <unk> percent <unk> -- a result of the , of the and the the of of and and the cost of the .
you know , the average <unk> , today , you <unk> products products .
so , typical typical walmart gives you an 100,000 products today .
but the <unk> supermarket that is today &apos;s <unk> supermarket in the world is <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be a of products -- a kind of sauce of in doses .
now in the world of the , i think one of the best examples of the are recently , the the the best of the , was something that david <unk> was very very , , it &apos;s a a program that &apos;s going to at harvard .
every single harvard &apos;s content now automatically now in a a .
those who really want to make a choice , they &apos;re going to have 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know , people people say , &quot; i don &apos;t know about it .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
and the first one i i want employees , &quot; tell me how the ways of different are different .
and if your employees can &apos;t be able to , , it can &apos;t &apos;t your your . . &quot;
now before we started started with lunch today , i had a conversation with with gary .
and gary , said he he would be willing to offer all the people in this audience to offer a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the most beautiful street .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i want to read to you .
and now i give you a few of seconds to read you and and i &apos;ll you you you you &apos;re willing to assume gary &apos;s . .
okay . everybody &apos;s willing to assume gary gary &apos;s touch .
is that all ?
well , let me show you some more of it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
now , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i &apos;ve heard more hands .
all right .
in fact , that &apos;s an objective , the first time , than the second time , but i would find it to guess that they it in the second time .
because the images made it real for them .
what brings me to to the second technique that you to with the problem of the , it &apos;s the <unk> . .
it &apos;s about people to understand the difference between opportunities to understand understand what consequences of the , which consequences of the , and that consequences of and and that really have to be .
why do people live average 15 15 percent more than 30 percent more than you use a <unk> card , than in a ?
because it &apos;s &apos;t really really money .
and it turns out that if you creates it , it feels quite quite a very good tool , so you make people to make more .
so we &apos;ve got in a study that i made with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve made a study with the people at <unk> -- employees that were all worked for <unk> -- and these people were all in in a meeting in they have signed their
and during this meeting , we have those meeting exactly as as she was , just we &apos;ve added a little more little .
the key thing that we &apos;ve been to , we we we people who to think of all positive things that might happen in their lives , they were going to save .
we we did this simple thing , there was a increase in the school of 20 percent and there was a increase in the number of people who were willing to save or a increase a increase in the amount they were willing to pay for the . .
the third technique : <unk> .
we can more than more than more than more .
so here is , for example , a study that we &apos;ve done in a <unk> . .
it turns out it &apos;s in the the <unk> in the the in the the , , the the number of <unk> from <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
but do you know what ?
when i i to them 600 magazines and i put them in 10 categories , i i just share with them , and they them 20 categories , you think i &apos;ve been them to have a and a better better , when i had had the the times , if i had give them 600 . .
because the categories tell me how to be apart .
here are two different <unk> of . .
one called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think that the left page is <unk> and the display on the right , , you clap in the hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that the left is jazz , and the , on the right side , you &apos;re clapping .
okay , a couple more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the the left is jazz and the on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a highly <unk> <unk> .
the categories have to tell something that not the the choices .
and this problem that problem , you often see , you look at the long points of all these fund .
who are you going to get it ?
my fourth technology : &quot; for complexity .
it turns out that we can actually deal with more information than we think we have to simplify it .
we need to increase the complexity .
i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the buy a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> that gives you the possibility to the the to your car completely .
they have to make for multiple decisions in order to design their car .
now , these decisions in the number of choices that they provide for a decision .
<unk> , <unk> , the cars -- i got <unk> .
motors , the -- four options .
what i do now is , i change the order of the .
half the customers is going to be about the many ways , <unk> <unk> , the the low ways , four .
the other half of the customers goes from the small , , four , , to the <unk> , , , many ways .
what am i looking at ?
how are interested .
if you &apos;re the the the the the the that that that that they &apos;re overwhelmed by the , i &apos;m losing it .
what what you find out is that people who are from the lot of the low <unk> and and over and over and over and over again .
we lose them .
go from the little choice of the , the lot of , they &apos;re going to stay .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i did done is the order to change the it is going to this information .
when i start with the simple simple , i &apos;m learning .
even though the the , you , , , nothing about my just my , , , , , it &apos;s always to to me .
it also also me me about the big product that i &apos;m <unk> , and i &apos;m willing to motivate me to with interest in interest .
let me summarize it .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that the the problem of the -- -- -- -- -- they &apos;ll take the <unk> alternative right right -- -- -- -- -- -- we can do more categories , more , more , , complexity .
each of these techniques i i &apos;ll describe to you you to to to to the possibilities -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for the people they they them service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re arguing with choices .
and the more we choose to choose sometimes , the the better we will be able to practice the art of the decision .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> , , , i &apos;m looking at . .
that &apos;s true .
today , we want to talk about how videos videos , and then then that &apos;s why that &apos;s important .
we all want to be -- , , , , , , , when i was young , was so difficult .
but <unk> have that that we &apos;re all of our creative activities , we can be very <unk> in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be the the the to the the for the .
but , youtube , more , over 48 hours , a a of a .
again , it &apos;s just a tiny percentage ever ever ever <unk> and and and and and and so that cultural moment .
so how does that work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and the unexpected .
well , let &apos;s do .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this video that he had had in the national national park .
2010 2010 , it was been million million times .
this chart shows what it looked like , as the video the the first was popular .
actually , no a a a video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;re doing that that when you &apos;re a <unk> mountain mountain .
he had a lot of <unk> <unk> .
and that video was actually sent in january january .
what is happening here ?
there was jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> <unk> the the that the the the the the the .
because the <unk> like jimmy <unk> , imagine us and and interesting things and and a a big audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> on on on <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . . didn &apos;t think that we were doing that conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
rebecca <unk> &quot; is one of the popular videos of year .
it &apos;s almost 200 million million a year .
this is the the chart looks like .
just like &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems to be from .
what &apos;s happened in day ?
well , it was friday , it &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other are are <unk> .
but what about this day , this , on this ?
well , <unk> <unk> , , , , , and they started writing about it .
michael j. nelson of the science theater was a first one that was a a a a .
important is that a person , or a group of <unk> a a of a a big audience , and it was <unk> .
then , these community formed these large <unk> , and and started talking about it and and to around it .
now there &apos;s 10,000 <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
already in the first seven days , there was a a for every single day .
unlike the <unk> conversation of the 20th century , the part of the community is to be part of this phenomenon -- either by by by by by the or make something new .
&quot; <unk> <unk> is animation and music in <unk> .
that &apos;s , it &apos;s simple .
this year year , it was almost 50 million times .
and if you have it for crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a <unk> of that that was four million times .
even cats , look at this video .
cats consider the cats to look at this video .
and , the creativity , which is creativity , which is the <unk> of the and <unk> .
there was <unk> .
somebody made an have to be an . version of it .
and then it was international .
a whole <unk> shot from the ground that made it from a just a a really a a of a that we can all participate .
now we don &apos;t find find pleasure about something we do doing .
who would have to to it ?
who would have been &quot; &quot; &quot; or or or or , or <unk> <unk> &quot;
what are you did to write where that <unk> things that ?
in a world where every minute of every minute , , , , can only really unique unique and unexpected <unk> like like i talked about .
i i i i was not a very , when a friend said , i should take this great video , about a guy who were in new york for the .
i got a ticket , i i i &apos;m not on the <unk> , but often there are people people don &apos;t drive a <unk> on the .
and it &apos;s completely surprising and and , , was casey <unk> funny funny and his argument five five million . .
this approach idea of everything we &apos;re to do .
and all of us us to a big question .
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative creative , , unexpected , , the features of a new type of media and culture that has access to the and and the the the audience .
as i said , one of the &apos;s <unk> <unk> -- justin <unk> -- made at youtube .
no one needs to give your ideas green green .
and today we &apos;re all feel like the of of our culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media , and they &apos;re &apos;t even meet the media in the media , but they will determine the entertainment of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about the about about the about the about three generations , and the the of of of the in life , a a girl , a a little <unk> , and a little boat in the <unk> , and , and , and , and , and , and , and today ?
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still together .
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece : a man that &apos;s his his <unk> .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man of the of of of the of of of of of of of and freedom of its home .
hold it in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> , , as he would have to to be a life of life .
the words , so long , his friends , <unk> .
he moved back back back . silence .
he died , the the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never never met him .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never never to me his life .
i had to to to it it was nothing for free , and it was my job to to that the story was trying to be us , we it .
the next thing system shows how a boat in the early <unk> <unk> <unk> a sea .
my mother was 18 , her father died , a <unk> , , , , , with two little girl .
for her , you had to put their job : the escape of their family and a new life in australia .
it was completely no that it could fail to fail .
after a four and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a boat on the sea , as a <unk> .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear of them , rape and rape and death .
like most adults on the boat was wearing a little <unk> of .
and a a <unk> , my sister and i , and i , and my my her grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the <unk> <unk> of the motors , the clapping of any wave of the , , vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the the that came to the , , but the men of the men , the the of the the of the the the the the of the the that who didn &apos;t
but i remember the lights of the <unk> of the the coast of the coast , and the young man who broke up and the , the the end of the journey was too much for him , and the the of the first <unk> of the the of the
no apple has ever been as so .
after three months , we ended up in in .
and the next thing is about four women in three generations that build together a new life .
we were us down in <unk> , , one of the <unk> <unk> , , the population of <unk> .
unlike the <unk> <unk> , that existence , i that i was not not unknown , there was no <unk> .
the <unk> from from the from the the rest of the world .
and the <unk> broken <unk> <unk> were <unk> between people that that the thing in common : they started .
my mother worked on a , , , a a line line in a <unk> , six days , twice .
it was to to to the time , english and and and .
we were poor .
every dollar was been and and it was in in for english and mathematics , no , what we had to do with the , , the the the the the , the , the , the , the , that would always come from .
two few of <unk> for school , every one to the the in the other .
a <unk> to the <unk> , because she had to be six years .
and there was the rare , , the <unk> <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; and here , &quot; , , , go home . &quot;
home ?
something is a little bit of .
there was a meet a reconciliation , and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was every first , , but we were told each each each of our day , and heard the the of the the of the grandmother .
my mother suffered from the boat from the boat .
and it was my task to stay up every night until their <unk> came to to it to .
she opened a <unk> , , a a <unk> and and a a .
and the women came with their stories about men who are not <unk> the change , angry and <unk> and <unk> , , and are among two worlds .
we have been and and and .
we have built built .
i lived in <unk> .
in one , i was the classic asian asian , , the <unk> has <unk> themselves .
in the other , i was able to have been able to live in <unk> , the tragic scars of violence , the <unk> and the . .
but so many were about years .
and because of this help , i was been in my last year of the year , the year of the year .
and i was been by a <unk> <unk> , and the the of the .
tan le , anonymous <unk> of <unk> , , , , , and social activist , who invited to to to to to to , , and in <unk> , their , , their , ,
i was not familiar with the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go into the and and the of of a unknown <unk> , a grandmother -- a mother , two daughters , who were every as 20 years of the , by each other the stories and told , three three three and the same same .
i said my mother , i would not create that .
she reminded me that i was so old as she was when we had the the boat .
no no way was never been .
&quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t &apos;t you don &apos;t . &quot;
so i talked about <unk> and education and and and the <unk> and <unk> .
and the more more i talked about , the more i i to tell .
i met people in all the , , so many of you were doing what they loved , lived in the boundaries of the .
and even though i had my my , i realized that i could &apos;t take me in a career in my . .
there was to be another <unk> . .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a to , a <unk> , , and not just okay , but it &apos;s something you you be grateful for , maybe a gift of the . .
because <unk> can make the <unk> to the <unk> , so easy that you think that you think of the the .
i &apos;m &apos;m going to from my <unk> to know that , , , , , the world , but not as you &apos;re it .
and that that were not allowed to be , were being determined .
there was a energy , a a , , a <unk> , , an strange <unk> of of humility and the <unk> .
so i i my feeling . .
i collected a small team of people to me for the <unk> , &quot; not a <unk> challenge .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a cents .
at the end of one , i i , i i a huge of of of soup soup that we shared us .
we worked up late late .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant , and we did the breakthrough .
i met the decision to move into the u.s.
after just one journey .
my feeling of . .
three months later , i moved and the the the the .
before i <unk> the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time , in the <unk> the social and the local was the most important person .
life has been changed since centuries .
her father died after her birth .
her mother moved her alone .
they were the the second woman in the , she was her her .
without the men &apos;s men she she she she a a <unk> , by him and <unk> in in your own case , and an even more <unk> than they won .
&quot; not &quot; she &apos;s <unk> .
i just <unk> in in a hotel hotel in sydney , and they died thousand miles away in in .
i looked around the the and and i looked at the other side .
i knew she was come to to say yourself .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went in a buddhist temple temple and sat in and sat in their own .
we told her stories and and they were that we were still .
at midnight , the monk and said he he needed to close the . .
my mother asked us to touch your hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of it is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because they think they think it morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; you don &apos;t get it . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s through the women .
you you can , who we were and how we actually shaped us , we can see that the men who have have in our lives , we were going to come to
the defeat would have been too .
now i have like my own kids , and i think the boat .
who would ever want one ?
yes , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , <unk> , <unk> .
can i give you a bug in your life , the bold of every wave , the <unk> , , <unk> <unk> , the the the , the &apos;s the sense of it
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and you could be <unk> , i would do it .
also , is is a mother &apos;s the the fourth or fifth series .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it all photography at all ?
because this is a picture that you can &apos;t take them on your camera .
yet yet , my interest in photography , when i first first first digital digital , at age 15 years .
i put it with my early <unk> , , but it was a little different , because the camera was in in the .
and if you put a picture of a a a a end end process , you you in the the .
so it was to to to to the , to to the right place at the right time .
i believed that everyone could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that begins when the will going to be .
photos like this : a construction site along a much more <unk> street .
but it has a unexpected twist .
and it &apos;s a realistic level .
or pictures like this -- dark and <unk> at the same time , but all the common to to to a realistic level .
if i say , i &apos;m <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that can really , , but i want to look like this as if you could have that , on a picture .
pictures you have to think a short moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s about about a idea , as a really moment .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but the end of the end , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how they can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can
it &apos;s not about what realistic is , but what we &apos;re to realistic .
so i think the are are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and and can can create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three of of physical physical physical physical objects that we can identify to in a three-dimensional world .
but in a particular sort of , , you can create something that looks quite three-dimensional , as if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that &apos;s not possible .
so we we <unk> our brains , because our brain simply didn &apos;t &apos;t really sense that it makes sense .
and i see same process of the in the photos .
it &apos;s really about to different of different realities .
so things that look like a picture of realistic , i think it are the things we don &apos;t think about things around us in our everyday .
but if we combine photos , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because you just just look like it wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to to to a a a result .
as you can see , they are not three three images .
but , , can take something special as this .
so the first rule is that that that the same perspective .
second , have have the same <unk> .
and these two images these these two images these two these -- from the same <unk> and the same . .
third , it &apos;s about to different , to different , where the individual images start and end , by them into it .
does it impossible to say , the photograph was actually made .
so by by color , contrast and , on the the the the the , , , , , , , , , <unk> colors and disorders , we &apos;re the the the the , and , and a picture of a picture , , a picture of levels can be hundreds of levels .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that this is a landscape landscape , and the bottom is is .
but this picture is actually completely put together , photographs of different places .
i personally personally that it &apos;s easier to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to come into into the ideas with your mind .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew i &apos;d had several months for a months to to them to the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish was been taken on a <unk> . .
the bank is from another place .
the <unk> is from a a .
and yes , i &apos;ve even the the on the island of red red , to look look .
so to get a a a result of a a result , it &apos;s seen from me .
i always always start with a <unk> , , an idea .
and it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
and here is a very very for every piece of
and if you take good good , , the result can be pretty beautiful , and too too .
so , they &apos;re all the tools , and the only thing that we &apos;re limited , is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you why so many electronic <unk> . .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped to to with our patients .
and one of the things we &apos;ve introduced on the <unk> , was to to do a <unk> .
and they &apos;re not particularly scientific out -- -- it &apos;s a cup cup of coffee or tea tea , and the patients , families , , , , , &quot; how is it ?
how can we help help ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why all -- perhaps the most of the electronic <unk> : : because we stopped going to
this is my <unk> . . a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a button , / .
and every morning i &apos;m going to .
and yes , i have a task , as you might recognize .
i have a job of <unk> <unk> .
it works works very simple , every time i throw up the scale , it to to the google health .
and they will also be from my my <unk> <unk> , so that can see where my <unk> is is , and not just in the moment i i need to support or or anything , but with a view of the past .
there &apos;s something else .
maybe you know this , i &apos;ve been known to , over 4,000 <unk> of twitter .
so every morning i &apos;m going to my my my , and and people talk to me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; for for a , for a little -- today , <unk> . &quot;
but this is the <unk> of what can happen , because this is the <unk> , to help patients , because that could be to obesity or it could be patients to the .
but it could also be used to get people to get people from their chairs , and to play any way of play , to control their health better .
just next week , this comes up to the market .
there &apos;s be this little <unk> of that you you a iphone or so that .
and it &apos;s going to to to the people to to your blood pressure , to your your two , and to to , for for something more than 100 dollars .
at this point , the patient come into the game , and they can &apos;t only do control of control , of the , , but can also help us in health care about the challenges that are in the the health , , , , and so on .
make them make the simple to use and start to to to the to a .
and you can get to that through these ways , but also through . .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you through a quick video .
we have all the <unk> in our cars .
maybe even in our phones .
we know exactly , where all of them around around <unk> .
we know one , where all the stations line are .
and clear , we can find <unk> .
but where would the next <unk> to to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and no one knew it .
nobody knew where the next former <unk> <unk> was in this moment .
so , what did we do ? we did in the netherlands netherlands .
we &apos;ve asked a a website and and you asked a <unk> , , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please , you , where he is when he he , &quot; because sometimes he closed while he was closed , he was closed .
and over 10,000 <unk> were were been in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for it .
and we have designed a <unk> . .
we developed an app for <unk> , , reality reality to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> and and , , you can use your iphone , and in the next few weeks , their <unk> to find the next the next to save the next the next .
and today , we don &apos;t want to be this as a <unk> as the product is , , but as a <unk> .
and we want to get this to a global level .
and we &apos;re trying to do our colleagues around the world , from other universities , which help us behave how to behave like <unk> to the the world .
and if you &apos;re on on and and , it &apos;s your own own , or anyone else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing we want to ask is that companies around the world are help us <unk> of these <unk> .
this could be <unk> , or or technicians for example , just to make sure that the <unk> <unk> is still in its place .
i want to help us and try and improve health , not just improve the health , but to your hand .
thank you .
today today i &apos;m going to be by unexpected discoveries .
i work in the <unk> .
and my little favorite thing , want we to force us to environment , by making it ...
... it &apos;s <unk> . .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may be , until it &apos;s . .
now , we can just pass it -- i &apos;ll just going to get the video .
no .
this is not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a couple of years ago , i launched a program to get the stars in technology and design a a year and work in a a , that &apos;s pretty much everything that they actually hate , we have in the government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , and it &apos;s a little bit like the <unk> . .
we &apos;re a few of , and we &apos;re working with a <unk> .
instead of send them to the third world , we send them in <unk> .
and they developed , more apps , worked with urban employees .
but what they really do is to show what is possible today .
so , al al .
al is a <unk> in in the city boston .
here &apos;s like he &apos;s a a date of a date , but what he really is looking at is someone who &apos;s him , when he &apos;s <unk> , because he knows , he &apos;s not very good when it &apos;s by a feet in the <unk> .
how did he come to to this particular kind of ?
we had a team of in in boston in the &quot; the &quot; for america .
they were there in february , and it has a lot of <unk> .
and they realized the city never never <unk> this fire fire .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik <unk> , , realized something else , and that was that the residents were <unk> to the the , directly to .
so he did what any good was doing , , he he he writing an app .
it &apos;s a nice app , where you can adopt a fire fire .
you <unk> to to <unk> to <unk> when it &apos;s <unk> .
if you do that , you can give it a name , and he called the first al al .
if you don &apos;t do that , can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game game .
this is a humble app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest apps that that have written in the last year .
but it does something that &apos;s no other <unk> .
they &apos;re quickly quickly .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> of the city of the city , which he was that that that could use that app , not not snow , but to the the .
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> work , , but people steal steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to to .
and then decided to have to to to use the app to clean the citizens to clean the .
and chicago has just introduced to the the people the the <unk> when it &apos;s <unk> .
now we know about nine cities cities , to save that app .
and she &apos;s very , , organic , of course .
if you know something about you , you know , it &apos;s not going to be .
the <unk> of software is a a few years .
we had a team that a a year in a project in boston , for three people took a half half .
it was a a way of the with the parents , which the the public schools for their children .
they told us later that if it would go over the normal channels , it would have been over two years , and it would have been over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing . .
there are there a project in the california &apos;s justice , that the most most have to two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on the at the level of the government .
so an app that is written in a few days days , and then is is is is a of shot of the the the the the institution in the institution .
it shows how the government could better work better -- no longer as a a , , like a lot of people think that should think .
and not even as a <unk> , , , it &apos;s like the internet itself .
and that is access access to means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more important about that app is that it represents a new generation that the problem of the problem -- not as the problem of an <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective <unk> .
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out that we &apos;re very well in the collective related to digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who create tools that we need to do things actually actually . together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , there are hundreds of people in the country that are up and get up and and and their their own communities .
they don &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re dreadful frustrated with her , but she didn &apos;t complain about it , they repair it .
and these people know something we lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s , if you &apos;re all your feelings about politics and the line in the and and the other things that we &apos;re really about , , , the , in the , , , &quot; what we do in what we can do in what we can do . &quot;
today , a lot of people gave up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i &apos;m you you you to get it , because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change the government is in the change .
and because the government end up the power of us -- -- -- &quot; we &quot; we people ? &quot; we we we think about it , will affect how this change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know very much about the government when i started this program .
and how many people , i thought that it &apos;s in the government , people to to in office .
now , two years , i &apos;ve come to the end that it &apos;s in in communities , in the .
this is the call of service service and information .
you come come out when you &apos;re in your city .
if you ever have the chance to work in in the <unk> call , like our fellow scott <unk> as part of the program -- in , , you &apos;re all , the people , the government , the government , a a of a <unk> in their house .
so , , this <unk> .
he &apos;s <unk> &quot; <unk> the official database .
and he &apos;s not really an idea . he &apos;s starting to the the <unk> .
and finally he he says , &quot; look , you can just open all the doors into your house and play very , and see if the the number of ? ? &quot;
and that worked .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> .
boston &apos;s not just a call call .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we didn &apos;t &apos;t written this app .
this is very smart people in the the office in the new urban city of &quot; in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- came this in this : &quot; <unk> in my <unk> . can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s dead .
how do i get it ? &quot;
but what &apos;s happened with &quot; <unk> <unk> .
scott , from human human .
but in &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; is everything that everybody can see it .
and in this case , it was a neighbor .
and the next post that we &apos;ve got , &quot; i went over there , the the the behind the house .
<unk> ? yes .
turned the the on the side . went home .
good &apos;s good , good , . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here is the digital digital .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how government is to to .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i &apos;m not necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m talking about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizens helped a citizens , but the government played in a a .
they connected these two people .
and you could have them with the , , if that needs , , but a neighbor is a a lot better and and alternative alternative to government services .
if your neighbor helps the other , we we our our communities .
let &apos;s call the <unk> , it &apos;s a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think that is is the government is not the same .
and most people understand that , but think that &apos;s one of the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is to .
how many , we have a political leaders -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we &apos;re us , and we expect the government and and our needs , and and has changed , and then &apos;t &apos;t have much ?
that &apos;s because the government is like a and and politics are the top the top .
and what &apos;s what is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word of such contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt , which we own , and we pay for for we &apos;re going to be something that us to us , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want this institution for us , we need to do to .
because that is where the real thing is happening .
we have to to to on the government of the government .
so the <unk> has done it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens who wrote a very detailed <unk> report , which is an answer to the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is not politically active , that is <unk> active active .
well , for the of us who &apos;ve given the government , it &apos;s time we think about about the world we we want to leave our children .
you have to to the the huge challenges that you have to to .
do we really believe that we we we to achieve , without the an institution that can do in the name of us all of us ?
one government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology is possible to make the function of the government in a way that actually can actually make something that can actually make a something that .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up the internet internet , and the knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to do to do it .
now the age age of our our is 28 , so i &apos;m , , , , , almost a generation than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up to see their voice as granted .
they &apos;re not fight fight that we all fight , who are going to speak ; they all can .
you can think , , , to every channel every every channel , and they do .
so , when you get faced with the problem of the , they don &apos;t care about it as much as to do their voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that are the work of the government .
and that apps to our hands to improve our our communities .
it might be , a fire fire , , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> with a <unk> .
and sure , we would have this this this that that the time , and many people do that .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we are not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers of the government who are paying and and . .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government until we improve the . .
so the question i i &apos;ve all of you here : when it &apos;s to the big , important things that we need to do together , we we &apos;re only going to be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of of hands ?
thank you .
and usually , my role to people how wonderful the new technologies that are the the , , , and i thought , i i &apos;m going to see , and i &apos;m going to to see what what , and what what what we &apos;re going to be so quickly , which that we can &apos;t keep it .
i &apos;m going to start by you just a single , step of boring slide .
... you you just show the slide .
this is a slide that i happen to i wrote from my wrote .
it &apos;s not to me about the details of the slide , but it &apos;s in the general form .
this slide is this slide is a of of analysis to us on the performance of the <unk> area , with the performance of a <unk> area .
what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , like others , others , that we often find find find find find find in in in our field , a kind of a on a <unk> curve .
in other words , every step here is a power in the in the . .
and this is a that that that we need to use this type of <unk> curves in the area of technology .
something very strange thing here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so if you could turn the lights back back .
another little bit more because i &apos;m going to draw something on the .
now , why do we draw that on technology technology technology ?
the reason for this is when i draw it on a normal curve , where we say , this is the years , the time of a , and this is a of of of technology that i want to to a a , , then the is be .
so they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , we &apos;ll say a a <unk> , , that would be very <unk> in the <unk> , in a form of a flat line .
but if something happens , this is the the <unk> of the .
so if the <unk> the <unk> as as the <unk> , , we could get <unk> into a taxi and spend 30 seconds in tokyo .
but it &apos;s not going to be .
there was never been before in the history of the , , these kind of <unk> growth , which is the to the the of the .
the question i i want to ask you is if you look at these exponential curves , you you see you don &apos;t go to go .
it &apos;s not possible that all all forever and forever forever as as as now .
there are two possibilities .
either it &apos;s going to a a classic <unk> of this , like this , to something new , , or it will happen to it .
that &apos;s what it is .
now , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think i think in the way that is going to happen .
it &apos;s really , that means , we &apos;re here in the right now in a .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the world world , a new kind of world .
so the question i i want to ask , and i also think of myself , is how this new world will be ?
what is this new state that the the world ?
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing when you &apos;re in in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in the year 2000 and the people were often about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now , here &apos;s a conference where the people talk about the future , and you find that the future is still the year 2000 .
and we &apos;re not going to go .
so in other words , the future is since since i &apos;ve been around in this world .
i think the reason is that we realize that there is something that .
it &apos;s the . . we can feel it .
and we know that there &apos;s just no sense to try and look a a to the future , and to the future , because it will be so different that a simple <unk> of of what we don &apos;t make any sense .
now i want to talk to what that could be , this transition that we &apos;re now now .
so , to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really have nothing to do with technology or computers .
because i think think that really understand this , we need to go back and go to the thing on a longer .
and i &apos;m going to look this on the the of of the planet .
i think the picture is makes sense , if you &apos;re <unk> it into some of the . .
so let &apos;s go back and and a billion billion years , the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with a lot of of .
now , if you look at the way , as we have been organized , , we have a pretty good picture of how you the the .
i think there are theories that to understand how to start with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a a story of which which is that that time , , , the different kinds of <unk> of them them .
some of these <unk> lives have a special combination of chemicals that allowed them allowed to to and and to them them to grow them from the .
everyone else were , , it began .
these little <unk> <unk> were the the <unk> <unk> .
but , this <unk> of not about alive in the same senses because every single one of them was just a small , <unk> recipe of chemicals .
and every time it shared , , that is <unk> in chemicals in the chemicals .
so every single <unk> was a little different .
in fact , the <unk> that had a for the growth of the , faster than other and and and more and more and and and and and .
so this is the way to survive longer , and they &apos;re in in <unk> .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but it gets when that <unk> learned a trick about abstraction .
in any way that we don &apos;t yet understand , these <unk> <unk> the ability to <unk> information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the the of the the information , and in a certain chemical shape that we call dna .
in other words , they have in this <unk> , evolutionary kind of a way that allowed them , they were them , so that that information could be and and be copied .
the amazing thing is that this this kind of information information about the about the billion years ago where they were done , the .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , exactly the same code and the same .
and every single living , the same is the same of the same code .
we &apos;re far , we just to the the , , that can write that code .
and i have here 100 <unk> of a white <unk> , which i &apos;m trying to keep in the airports .
in is -- what i &apos;ve done is i &apos;ve got this code -- -- the code that we use to the <unk> -- and i have a <unk> on a a piece of dna , and i got it 10 <unk> 22 times more .
so if someone &apos;s got a hundred million copies of my <unk> , , i i have enough for everybody in this room and even the one in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was been a a <unk> , i would have been written them on a virus and <unk> in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the <unk> of dna dna was an interesting step .
and the <unk> of cells -- that she she she happy for another billion years .
but then another another thing happened , really interesting step where things were completely different , and they started to communicate these cells and to to to the and so communities from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually care their dna .
that &apos;s why for example , the reason for for is to antibiotics .
some bacteria have found out how they can cut away from penicillin and have these information together with other bacteria in dna , and we have a lot of bacteria that are 8,000 to penicillin , because the bacteria communicate each other .
now , communication this machine allowed to communities that were in a certain sense in the same boat ; they were <unk> .
so they they were either survive , or they went together , , that that that that when a community was successful , all individuals individuals who are over the the community and and and and of the evolution .
the the <unk> is is where where these communities are so close to the the recipe for the whole community into a <unk> .
and the next interesting stage took about another billion years .
at that point , we have <unk> communities communities communities communities , from many of <unk> , which are together to single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a such a community community .
we have a lot of cells that are not alone .
your skin cells are useless without heart heart cells , muscle cells cells , and cells and so on .
so those communities began to be , so that the level that was been doing , not longer the the the the the the the the the the the that we call organism .
the next step happened happened within this communities .
the <unk> started to <unk> information .
and they developed special structures that could nothing do to process information information in the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the <unk> of the that have built these <unk> .
they start to to in specialists in the community , of structures that they were responsible for learning , and that &apos;s about information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point , this is an individual -- learning happened within the period of life of life , a single organism , instead of the evolutionary period of time .
so one organism could learn to learn a a a a a a a a , because they liked bad and it made sick , the the last time he has eaten her .
this could be in the average of of the single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years , that , that information has been learned to from the individuals that died because of these <unk> , because they were not there yet .
so the nervous system has the <unk> of with this particular <unk> , because evolution could could be inside within a individual individual .
it could be a in a time time .
what happened to that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate each other .
so , example , the <unk> of the <unk> is the human language is human language .
it &apos;s a amazing astonishing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i basically just <unk> notes , i &apos;m to to a a idea of a very <unk> idea of a very idea of a to a idea of a idea of my original idea .
so we take a very complicated , so it turn it in sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to to to a a a of one one .
and what we &apos;ve actually made , we we &apos;ve got to , we &apos;ve started to .
we go through the same that , which have been through the , -- the abstraction of our ways we can data , we &apos;re us , present .
the invention of the language for example , was a little step into this direction .
<unk> , computers , computers , <unk> , and so on , our our , we we we built in our community to be to to .
and it connects us to something that &apos;s much bigger , and also able to be faster faster than we were been .
so , evolution can be done in the number of . .
you &apos;ve also seen <unk> little <unk> <unk> , where he showed a little bit of evolution in the <unk> , right , your your eyes .
so we have the <unk> again again .
the first steps of history i told you , a billion years a a .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , a few hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , like language , and so on , less than a million years .
and these have these steps , as electronics , seem to take few decades .
the process feed itself , and so i think , , is the word -- -- when something its <unk> more .
the more it changes , the faster changes it .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that feed themselves .
i live living from the computers , and i know that i have the mechanism i use using computer , not using no , without the the of the .
my current situation is to making objects of of complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design these in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor in the <unk> .
it &apos;s got billions of them .
what i instead of what i do instead , and what the designers of thinking of thinking is , we think of a certain , , , the machine , and the machine makes something that the the to to , , and and than than we could do it everything .
and it makes it part of the ways that we don &apos;t even understand .
a way that is particularly interesting , and what i have used in a lot of time , is the evolution .
we we install a <unk> in in the machine which is in the the <unk> . .
to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that which is of random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> , , a million a hundred of of instructions .
now , you all all these , they , , , , all the programs , and choose the those who are the the of these those are the . . &quot;
so in other words , i first &apos;m trying to first .
let &apos;s say , i want to sort of a numbers , that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve used for .
so the key programs that can can most most numbers .
of course , the the chance of , , , a , a very small , that they have have any numbers , , so probably don &apos;t have the instructions .
but one of those may be happiness in the right the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take take the 10 percent of the sequences that have come to the the next .
and , , , the rest of the rest .
now , all the <unk> that that the numbers of the .
and that is a of of the , , to to . .
take two programs and they produce kids through the exchange of their <unk> , and the kids are the of the of the of the of the two programs .
so i have a new generation generation of programs that came through the of of programs that have something closer closer to the these are more closer to the the . .
tell say , &quot; please again this process . &quot;
<unk> it again .
you may have a some mutations .
and try it to with another other generation .
all of these generations are few of milliseconds
and so i can get one evolution in a of years of years in the computer or in more complicated cases , some few hours .
and finally , i get programs that can take the numbers .
the fact , these programs are so much efficient than every program that i could ever have ever write from hand .
and then i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell them how they work .
i tried to understand it .
it &apos;s a and strange programs .
but they do doing the job .
i i know , i &apos;m sure that you do the job , because they come from a a of of programs that have done the job .
because their lives was on whether they did the job .
i sat in a a with with , , , he <unk> a map , and says , &quot; oh look look . look at this .
there &apos;s this plane is <unk> <unk> , which are together work together to make the less secure . &apos; does not make you ? &quot;
we know that a <unk> is not a to be when it becomes too complicated .
so we start on to computer , for a process that is a a lot of the the .
it allows us things with a much better complexity than it allow the normal methods to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the ways of it yet .
so , <unk> <unk> us technology .
we &apos;re using these programs to make the computers a lot faster , so that we can able to do these these processes more faster .
so it &apos;s a <unk> . .
it &apos;s going faster and faster and and i think that &apos;s the reason it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies of these are feed by themselves .
we &apos;re down .
we &apos;ve been at a point where the is to to the , as a <unk> <unk> .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t quite make , what is we &apos;re actually going to do .
we &apos;re in the middle of this <unk> .
but i really believe that after us come up .
i think it &apos;s very <unk> of us to say that we &apos;re the the of of evolution .
and i think we &apos;re all of of the creation of whatever &apos;s going next .
well , lunch is before and i &apos;m going to hear here now before i &apos;m going to .
my story starts right here in in , , about two years ago .
i was under the the of the in the desert with <unk> <unk> ali .
we talked about that changed has been the the of the ancient indian indian <unk> . &quot;
if we wanted to travel , we we back into a car and <unk> about the sky .
now we do this with the heart of . .
in the time the big indian <unk> <unk> <unk> , he took an bow , took a bow , the the and water .
now we do this with <unk> and machines .
we came to the that that magic and magic magic by by machines .
that really really really sad .
i got a little fear of technology .
it was afraid that i could lose the ability to enjoy the , without the , without no to my friends .
i found that technology should be possible and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather had his little <unk> <unk> .
this piece of 50 technology was the <unk> <unk> thing for me .
it became a <unk> access to a world full of of , and and and and and in my idea .
i came to to it as we had our our and and and dreams .
they were going to be inspired by them .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use it to to to make magic rather rather than kill .
i i started to to i started to . books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to storytelling , to the the the the world .
it can know how we keep it .
it can know where we are .
it bring pictures and text together , animation , and and touch .
that storytelling is natural themselves .
but what do we do with that ?
i &apos;m just going to <unk> , an interactive ipad app .
here &apos;s , &quot; put your fingers on any light . &quot;
and so -- this is : &quot; this box , &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;ll figure a figure in the book .
and back , a letter to me -- and the ipad white white white white white white white , i &apos;m live -- i &apos;m going to .
the kid in me is really really about this kind of opportunities .
i &apos;ve talked about magic . magic .
i don &apos;t mean by the and and the , , but the magic of childhood , that ideas that we all had children .
fireflies in a glass , i was always been exciting .
so you have to go through the ipad and and the the .
and the the the the the the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a kid is that a a a galaxy can be in a single single . .
and so , every book is going to a a little little <unk> that i &apos;m going to the the there &apos;s the the there is the the . device .
and this opens open up a map .
<unk> had always had cards , but these maps were static .
this map is growing and and and and to the the rest of the book .
it &apos;s also themselves to other other of the book .
i &apos;m going in here .
it &apos;s important for me to to do something that that is is , but also very <unk> .
these are the <unk> . .
we &apos;ve all heard of <unk> and <unk> , but many people people out of india &apos;s india , india , the india ,
the poor <unk> were caught in in <unk> in , in a old <unk> book .
and we bring them back in a contemporary history for children .
a story that &apos;s new , , , , like the <unk> .
the issue of <unk> , a big problem of the last 10 years is that children children children in their , , their computers , without out .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our children in the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book , you &apos;ll sent to a search for a , you you go out and go out and the the the of of natural objects .
as a kid , i had <unk> of <unk> , stones , <unk> and <unk> .
somehow , the children don &apos;t do .
this is <unk> <unk> . you have to go out to a chapter a a picture a flower and mark .
in another chapter , you have to tag a piece of <unk> and and .
so , actually , a digital collection of photographs that you can make online .
a kid in london , a a of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a . . &quot;
a child in india said , &quot; today , i saw a monkeys . &quot;
this is a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually has .
there &apos;s a variety of possibilities in the magic world and the technology .
in the next book , we &apos;re going to plan a interaction in the the of the , and by <unk> reality , is a animation of the that that on a plant .
in a point , the the the .
you have to make the sound of the , , and you and and the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the forces of the technology to closer and and in the magic and and technology .
we use energy energy energy .
we bring our children and our closer to the natural world and the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple power of a story .
thank you .
this is really a extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prison , prison or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with the social <unk> in the <unk> and places places where there are a lot of . .
here &apos;s at ted , to see how how , that is , has given a lot of power .
so in the short time , i was one of me : ted has a identity .
you can tell things that have the around the world .
and sometimes when something coming about ted , it gets a meaning and power that couldn &apos;t have it .
i say that because i think it &apos;s important important .
we &apos;ve seen some amazing stop stop .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher &apos;s a , but that &apos;s the words of a dedicated teacher were particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a <unk> , but you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learned the my work in my work .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional <unk> household , who was inspired by a <unk> <unk> , and this <unk> was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , , , woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every <unk> .
it was also the start of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> . .
their parents were born in the <unk> in virginia as a .
it was born in , and the experience of slavery , their can very very .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also as well .
if i met her as a young boy , she came me me and <unk> me .
and they put me so that i could barely breathe . then she &apos;d me me .
one or two hours later , when i was her , she came up and said , &quot; <unk> , , you , do you have my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; no , , she me me again . if i said &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; she &apos;d me me .
she was something that was that you wanted always wanted to be near her .
the only problem was that that had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of their 10 children .
sometimes , if i wanted time to spend her , it was hard difficult to get their attention .
my cousins walked around around .
i remember i have to be eight or nine , i went woke up one morning and i went in the room room . all my my my my my my my my my .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the <unk> and and and at me .
first first thought i was that that was a game .
i looked at her and i was , but she saw very serious .
so , was was about 15 or 20 minutes , she she came up and came up to me , she she took me , and said , &quot; come on , &quot; you , &quot; you , &quot; you , &quot; you . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out and said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you &apos;ve got to promise you you you &apos;t . &quot;
i said , &quot; i , &quot; i . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
she sat down me and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve you .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you only have to promise me three things , &quot; . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; first first <unk> , me that you &apos;re always going to love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to promise you you always care about them . &quot;
i i my mother , so i said , &quot; yeah , i &apos;m , i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
and she said , &quot; &quot; next to me , you you &apos;re always going to do the right thing . &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , &quot; and i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; the last thing you have to me me is you you never drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yeah , grandmother . i promise . &quot;
i grew up on the the , rural , rural south , and i have a brother that a year older and a year seconds .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day , my brother came home and and was was this <unk> beer with my sister and and and and went to the forest .
we &apos;re just around as as else as it .
and he took a of of beer beer and offered my sister &apos;s sister , and she took them , and then they give me me .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . it &apos;s . . . just don &apos;t want to . . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do we do this , today , you &apos;re doing anything else we do .
i had what your sister had . go , a a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . you just . . . . .
my brother had to me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? &quot; well , what . &quot;
and he looked at the face and said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t the crazy of the with the , &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandmother told all the grandchildren that you are special . &quot;
i was destroyed the the ground .
i &apos;m going to say something .
i should not probably to do that .
this is maybe in the .
i &apos;m a years old , and i i i &apos;ve never never a a of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s <unk> . i say that because identity means .
if we can do the right kind of identity , we can tell people to tell us things that they don &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they could &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would tell her grandchildren , they &apos;re special .
my grandfather was during the <unk> in the prison .
my uncle died of <unk> diseases .
and she believed that this are the issues to to take care .
i tried to to something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in was 300,000 people in <unk> and in in prison .
today , it &apos;s million million .
the united states have the highest world &apos;s largest <unk> .
seven million people are being <unk> or or <unk> <unk> .
i think , , our world , our world is fundamentally changed .
in social weak and black parts of the population , you , and and , , of this changes .
one of three of black black black and 30 is in prison prison , in prison , <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
in urban communities , across the country -- from los angeles of philadelphia , in , , washington -- is 50 to 60 percent of all the black men in in prison in prison , in <unk> ,
our system is not just by by asking by questions that have to do with <unk> , it &apos;s also <unk> by poverty .
we have a a in this country , which they better better better if they can be rich and <unk> as an poor and innocent .
wealth , not <unk> , the the result .
but yet , we seem to be pretty happy .
it &apos;s a politics of fear and anger , us that these problems are not problems .
we &apos;ve lost touch .
i think that interesting .
there &apos;s some <unk> developments .
my home state <unk> , , they they the the <unk> when they &apos;re <unk> .
here , here , in in , we have percent of the black population lost their <unk> .
we <unk> that in 10 years , the the of of the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> as high as the <unk> of the <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i <unk> children .
many lot of my <unk> are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world , the <unk> children in the in the .
in this our country , there are <unk> <unk> <unk> without without without common . .
we &apos;ve already got a lot of process .
the only country in the world .
i &apos;m people in <unk> .
the the question of death is is is an interesting question .
we think because we &apos;ve taught us to that the real question is : has a human him to die for a <unk> ?
this is a very very question .
but you can think about it , depending on how we see our identity .
the other view is not has a a for a crime for death , but , have we deserves to kill ?
i think that fascinating .
the death death in america defined by error .
on nine people we &apos;ve introduced , which is a that we have a <unk> , , the <unk> and and from the death row .
an amazing <unk> . . one of nine innocent .
i think that fascinating .
we &apos;d never going to fly somebody with a plane , for nine airplanes , the , , one one .
but somehow , we we of this problem of this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i talk about race , and the question , whether we &apos;re right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i i my my students my my my my . . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time of the <unk> , , the the world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about this .
but for the , in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many places , people had to have people of <unk> .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror who shaped their lives .
these older people are come to me and say , &quot; mr. , <unk> , you talk , they &apos;re talk , they say , they &apos;re to to say that we to to to the first time in history of our nation with terrorism : after the 9 / . .
they say , &quot; no , you say , people that we grew up with . &quot;
and after , , of , , of course , the <unk> and decades of <unk> and and and . .
and yet , in our country , we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what meaning of our did in the historical context .
we &apos;re all all each other .
we &apos;re always able to do new tensions and
it &apos;s going to get about race about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to get us to the the truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people people understood that the <unk> doesn &apos;t get to the the connection to the truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were this willingness but not in this country .
i &apos;ve been some some of the in germany .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s profoundly , , to hear you .
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death death .
and of course , it can &apos;t be able to be .
it was still still . then a woman said , &quot; with our history , it &apos;s impossible that we ever kill us for the for the for the .
it would be <unk> of us , aware of us and and people . .
i thought about it .
what would it would feel like to live in a world where german german state people people people , especially when that was a lot of jews were a .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , here in this country , in the the of the , we are people -- here is the risk to become from death , 11 times , , when the the is , , the the , in the the same states , the body is <unk> people .
and yet there &apos;s this mental <unk> .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with with these these these , , , and the positive and wonderful things also are . .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but then , these realities of realities , , , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
i it seems important to combine both .
because we &apos;re talking about that we need more hope , more commitment , more commitment to more commitment to in a complex world .
for me , the time , to to think about the poor , the the , the , the , that never be in ted .
but think think in a way that our own lives .
we all have to believe that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . we we we we we we we really appreciate .
innovation , creativity , development is not just from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by by the in our hearts .
it &apos;s this <unk> , i think that you &apos;re us to not just be open for all the light and <unk> things , but also the dark and the .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politicians , said , has said .
&quot; when we were in eastern europe we we we were to do all , we we we we were most of , , , , a mental behavior , a intellectual intellectual intellectual , , to be in , and and . .
so mental intellectual is the core of of what i think that is also the the to have to have to .
there &apos;s no way of technology technology and design that allows us to be , to be human , as long as we don &apos;t also see eyes and ears and <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity , a lot more of us than we we &apos;t about about .
it will touch with . .
as a young lawyer , i <unk> the great privilege to meet pink parks .
and parks came over back back to <unk> , where they <unk> two of her oldest friends , these older women , <unk> <unk> , had <unk> the <unk> -- -- -- -- -- a <unk> -- -- and virginia <unk> , a white , <unk> , dr. king <unk> .
so these women met and and and talked .
and , and called me , and , and he said , &quot; <unk> , , , , in the city . we want to talk .
do you want to <unk> and listening ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very , very . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you doing when you are here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and and i just .
it was always inspiring so so so <unk> .
and one day i was there , and i heard and and and and a few hours of turned to me to me , &quot; &quot; , &quot; , &quot; you say , &quot; you know , what the &quot; <unk> for
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go against injustice .
<unk> people want to help people who were convicted of a innocent .
we want to have and and and to fight with the .
we want to <unk> <unk> without without <unk> <unk> for the children .
we want to to to the death death .
we want to get the number of number of . .
we want to <unk> . . &quot;
i gave my my my my my my , and and she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . &quot; . &quot;
she said , &quot; it will going to be very , very tired . &quot;
then , woman <unk> <unk> me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and so they have to be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and so i think the ted life should be .
we need to to to the the challenges : this problems , this is sorry .
because finally , our humanity , our humanity from our humanity .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i &apos;ve learned a few of things .
that we all all more than the worst worst we ever ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every person on the planet .
if someone lying lying , it &apos;s not just a a .
if somebody &apos;s something that it doesn &apos;t hear it , it &apos;s not just a . .
even who kills someone , it &apos;s not just a killers .
and because that &apos;s , there &apos;s a fundamental human that has to respect the law .
i also think that in many parts parts of this country , and in a lot of the parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t believe that .
i think that in many places , the opposite of of poverty .
and finally , i believe that though it &apos;s so dramatic , so , so beautiful and so <unk> , we &apos;re &apos;t be in in our technology , not in the things we &apos;re developing , not our our and mind .
and finally , a society is not measured how they can rich and powerful and powerful and and , but it &apos;s with the poor , the <unk> , the <unk> .
because in this context , we start to understand the amazing things that that makes us .
sometimes i &apos;m it balance balance . a story .
sometimes i i to to .
i &apos;m &apos;m going to tired of the way we all .
sometimes , people people to our our , in important important way .
i <unk> these children who were been a very hard to be a <unk> .
i go to the <unk> and and i go to a a , , or 14 or 14 years old , and the as adult .
i i ask , how could that happen ?
how can a judge turn into something that it &apos;s not ?
the judge looks as adults , but i see a child .
and one night i stayed for a long time , and i thought my god , if a judge can transform us into something else , he has to have .
the , , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should want want one .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think right , i started working on a .
i had a <unk> , poor , poor boys as a .
and i started to this this . the &quot; said , &quot; , , my poor , <unk> black black clients like a <unk> , white <unk> <unk> . &quot;
in my my , i explained that <unk> of the <unk> and and the police and and the police and and the .
there was a crazy line about that that in this country is nothing more more <unk> that there there is there .
the next morning , i woke up and i didn &apos;t know if i did this crazy , , i was actually &apos;t really , or i was actually written .
and i my my , i didn &apos;t just written it , but he also got to the court .
a few months of months , and i &apos;d just forget about it .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go into the dish , and i &apos;m crazy case .
i was to to the car and i was really overwhelmed . overwhelmed .
so i was him to dish .
and i thought that &apos;s so hard , so painful .
finally finally went out of my car , and went the staircase for the dish .
when i was the staircase for the court , there was a elderly , black man , the the in the court .
when he saw me , he came up to me , and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i am a lawyer , &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
he came to me and <unk> me .
then he <unk> into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of her . &quot;
and i have to say , there were some force .
it touched a little bit deep in my , identity , the ability to to a to a community to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i walked up the <unk> .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , did you do this crazy bill ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started discuss .
more people came in in , just because they were angry .
i had written these crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> and and and .
in the <unk> , the <unk> of of people who were angry , that we were talking about skin , about poverty , about inequality .
i saw my <unk> i saw the i did .
he saw saw over through the window and and the whole whole of .
he went up and off .
and finally , older , , the older black man came with a very <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and then down , , , and then the <unk> .
ten minutes later , the judge left a break .
during the break came in a <unk> in the , that was the the was in the . .
this <unk> ran over to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the <unk> ? &quot;
the the the the the the the the , , and he looked at the <unk> , he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to say , &quot; i &apos;m here to say , i don &apos;t want to get
i &apos;ve come to ted , because i think many of you have understood that the moral the of the universe the universe , but it &apos;s the justice .
that we &apos;re not developed as people as people as we &apos;re not to human rights and and we have .
that our living survival is to survive every every .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , to to to , , , , pity and justice .
and most of all , i want to to of you that that also see that , just say , don &apos;t lose the goal from the eyes . don &apos;t give them .
they have seen this in this audience , this community , this community , and and to help them and do something .
what can we do ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there are opportunities anywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> in that spring , it &apos;s about to a to actually make a effort , something that the <unk> of the that that the the politics .
here , in california , for example , you will going to have a billion dollars for the next five years , a billion dollars a billion dollars .
and yet , , percent of all the <unk> doesn &apos;t have with a <unk> .
<unk> percent of all the <unk> come from court .
here &apos;s the chance to do something .
this is is going to suggest that money in more more and and security .
i think there are opportunities anywhere .
during the last three decades , the &apos;s the in in the in in the . .
that fact , that fact , in a a a relationship with the . .
what would you say somebody who thinks that ?
well , in fact , the number of the doesn &apos;t changed very much .
most of the most of the in this country , not really in the class of the . .
it was the <unk> <unk> against drugs against drugs .
so the dramatic dramatic come in in the in .
we have <unk> us from the rhetoric of punishment .
now we have <unk> <unk> <unk> that people are people behind the , , for a <unk> , for the <unk> <unk> for the <unk> of , instead of the to to the victims .
i think we need to do more to help people who become become the victims of a <unk> , not less .
and i think our our our our our our our our .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , , they &apos;ve actually brought a string string .
they &apos;re a inspiring personality .
thank you for ted . . thank you .
this is a death death has an increase in an .
two two : famine in somalia .
four four : <unk> <unk> .
six six : social decline .
eight : <unk> . . after <unk> <unk> .
different speakers : <unk> . destruction of the . .
recession . <unk> . egypt . egypt . syria .
crisis . death .
oh my god .
so this is just a few of the clips that i &apos;ve been over the last six months -- but it had the last six days , or the last six years
the fact is that the media prefer to to to all of negative stuff because our mind is get that issues .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
every second every second every second , our we have have more information information than our brain has ever process .
and because , because nothing is our our our our our , the first first stop for all the information of our <unk> , the the .
so the the is our <unk> system , our <unk> system .
it &apos;s and and <unk> the entire information in the search of the bottom of the in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look at the fantastic news for .
and the old course , when it &apos;s <unk> , it goes up , the demand demand .
well , with all our digital devices , the seven days , 24 hours of all the the <unk> news , , it &apos;s not a miracle that we are . .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks it &apos;s always doing bad .
but maybe this is not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
perhaps , the enormous effect that we &apos;ve done in the last century , we &apos;ve made a series of forces , so strong that it will possible to the next three decades , to create a world of
now , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , <unk> , water and water -- -- we have .
and as humans , we are much better in in problems , very , , but they finally get to to .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century we we can have to that .
in the last 100 years , the average expectancy has more than doubled , the the <unk> of the population population has <unk> .
child mortality has a a tenth of a .
and it &apos;s the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and costs of <unk> of a have have .
steve pinker has shown us that we live in a very lot of life in the life .
and by charles <unk> , the <unk> <unk> in the past 80 80 percent 80 percent 80 percent of 80 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we are going to get our expectations on .
in fact , we have made poverty .
remember , a lot of american american american lives , the the poverty , access to water , water , toilets , the , , , , , , , and and cars .
the richest of of the last century , the <unk> of the earth , would never have been able to have <unk> .
the basis of a of of technologies and these and grow .
my great friend of ray kurzweil has showed us that every tool that is to be information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and the <unk> , and the the of the 12
that &apos;s why the cell phone in your pocket , a million times less and times faster faster than a ears from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s moore &apos;s law for last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , , as it it it -- good like in good times , war or peace , or , depression and <unk> .
this is the result of faster computers , to the faster computers .
she down to not of our big problems .
and , despite their <unk> <unk> on the left , it &apos;s <unk> .
so the rate of the global itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the from moore &apos;s law , we find a of of extraordinary technologies that are available to all .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; something that my friends in with with , , , , and and , , robots , the 3d printer that allow us to to the the personal production on our planet , , , , , , , , , and and intelligence intelligence .
how many of you have the victory of <unk> in in the risk ?
that was a big .
i &apos;ve been the the the the the the best headlines that i could find .
i love this , &quot; watson <unk> human are . . &quot;
risk is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understand the in of the .
imagine that that artificial intelligence is to every of of the .
four years ago , ray kurzweil , and i &apos;m a a new university , which called called called called called called called called called called called called called called called called called called called called called called called called called called called called called called called called called called called called
we bring our students all these these technologies with so , on , so how that used to be used to solve the the of humanity .
and every year we &apos;re trying to create the students , , , products and services , within a decade , the live in of people of people .
think about that a group of students can change lives of people &apos;s lives .
30 years ago , this was ridiculous .
today we can have the dozens of companies that that that that that .
if i think of , more more , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for every on this planet ; it &apos;s about to a of of ways .
it &apos;s about to of of goods goods .
and is is <unk> , and technology is a a <unk> power .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in in the middle of the 18th century .
it &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of <unk> <unk> for dinner .
<unk> soldiers were <unk> , <unk> , <unk> himself .
the king of <unk> , but was <unk> .
now , this time , the most most most that time on the planet , valuable as gold and <unk> .
this is the the dome of the <unk> of the <unk> .
even though , <unk> percent of the the , , , it &apos;s not a pure metal metal .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology of the technology technology , and made it so cheap that we use it with our our <unk> .
and then , this analogy for the the the future .
we think about <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;re live on a planet of the more energy energy more energy than we use a every year .
16 <unk> energy energy , all the the the the on the earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about , , the problem is . .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you were going to be the the cost of the for for in india , to 50 percent of the <unk> -- <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
the cost of solar energy in the last year . 50 percent .
and last month , this was published that that , that , the end of this decade in the the of the the in the the , in the , in the , to 15 cents in the national average .
and if we have a <unk> , we &apos;ll have water water water .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
remember , as carl carl &apos;s the <unk> 1990 , when it was on saturn , was going to the earth ?
he took a famous photo . how was it ?
&quot; a <unk> blue . &quot;
because we &apos;re on a life .
we live on a planet that &apos;s still 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent of water , , two percent of the , , and we &apos;re fighting to percent of water on the planet , but there &apos;s there too .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
and from a called a morning with dean <unk> , one of the innovators of do it it , i want to share with you -- -- he gave me permission -- his <unk> , , &quot; the <unk> , &quot; and , and many of you might have heard of a <unk> in the <unk> .
it can create a thousand of clean drinking drinking drinking drinking per day -- -- -- -- -- water , , , -- and all for less than two cents a . .
the president of coca-cola just has just <unk> a a a a a of a a of units in developing countries .
and when it &apos;s well well , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola is going to the global in in the countries around the planet .
this is <unk> innovation that there today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
you my goodness , we soon , we soon the 70 percent of the mobile phones in developing developing countries in the end of the .
just think that a <unk> of a cell phone in a <unk> in the middle of kenya , a better better <unk> than president <unk> .
and if you &apos;re looking for your smartphone , you have more access to knowledge and information than president clinton .
they live in a world that has information and communication , as nobody nobody can have to predict .
and it &apos;s better , the things that you and i spent several thousand dollars -- -- -- -- gps , and and and , , , libraries of books and technology , the medical medical -- are are going to be <unk> and cheaper in their mobile phone .
and the best thing is possibly what what &apos;s in in in the .
i had the pleasure last month , the <unk> called called the <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> .
we &apos;re teams to all the world , all these technologies to connect to each other in a mobile phone that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s with artificial , , you can <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
and to to win , to a a to a a a a a a a team of <unk> doctors .
imagine that device , in the in a developing world , where there &apos;s no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of the employees of the health .
if this device a device that a machine machine or a <unk> that &apos;s not known , it &apos;s the for the center and and and not a pandemic in front of their outbreak .
but now the largest force that is going to lead us to a world of the .
i call it &quot; the next billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just destroyed the <unk> . .
and only by the way , the largest <unk> <unk> is a a a of education and diet in the world .
in 2010 , we had just connected to two people online .
by 2020 , we &apos;re <unk> from two five five billion .
three billion new heads that we never heard heard before , will the global global communication .
what do these people need ?
what will they consume ? what will you going to desire ?
and instead of a <unk> , i see one of the largest economic economic <unk> of history .
these people represent multiple trillion dollars that will flow into global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier by the use of the , and they &apos;re getting better to the the , and and they have to have the opportunity to have 3d 3d 3d 3d and and the <unk> of , , more
so what can three billion growing , healthy , , , productive members of the us ?
what about a sentence of new , never never been <unk> .
what about the the , the the , , , and they are are voice to make a voice to make and make change , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people bring ?
what about the <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i &apos;ve learned about the x prize is that little teams who are all to passion and focus , extraordinary things , can can can do things , and governments in the past .
i want to finish with a story that really really me me .
there &apos;s a program that some may have been .
it &apos;s a game that is the .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game that people can take a sequence of amino acids and explore how the protein will going to develop .
the ever after his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the <unk> .
so far , this was a a a .
and this game was played by by by . .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that these these cards , the the the the the the the the the the .
and as these people came and looked , who the the best <unk> of the world , this was not a <unk> , , it was no <unk> , , , a woman who was in a <unk> , in a <unk> , in the the the the the best <unk> in the world .
ladies and gentlemen what what important trust is in our future is the fact that we have more than more than individuals to to us to the the the of our planet .
we have access access to with with technology .
we have a passion of the .
we have the capital of the <unk> .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work online to design the new challenges , and to do that what needed .
we expect a couple of remarkable decades .
thank you .
i think we have to have something against a <unk> piece of medical medical culture .
and i think it &apos;s a medical medical , and i &apos;m .
and maybe i am already long enough in the , i i can give me a piece of my own wrong <unk> to make this .
but before i talk to me , i &apos;m talk to talk about a little bit of baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re near the <unk> and and move to the world .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of a .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; is soon and about statistics and and to to to a a a a a a baseball team .
i &apos;m going to to a that i hope that most of you have heard heard .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a a <unk> .
that means that the player is <unk> three 10 <unk> .
that is the ball into the <unk> , he comes up , he &apos;s not getting caught , and who tried the ball to the first , , it didn &apos;t done time and and the was in .
three from 10 .
you know how to call a <unk> <unk> in <unk> ? ?
well , really , , maybe a <unk> .
you know how to call a <unk> ?
this is someone of the one of the one of the .
<unk> -- like ted williams <unk> -- the last <unk> <unk> of during a <unk> season during a <unk> season .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , which i i a some some some some some , or maybe a little bit of i i &apos;ve been talking about it .
imagine you have a <unk> , and they &apos;re going to a a <unk> , that &apos;s <unk> in in <unk> .
somehow doesn &apos;t work , isn &apos;t it ?
imagine you &apos;re living in a particular remote area , and they have got a beloved people with <unk> <unk> and and their <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> in 200 .
but , but you know what ?
it &apos;s much better this year . it &apos;s on the <unk> branch .
and it &apos;s a <unk> . .
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think think like the <unk> for a or a nurse or a nurse , a <unk> , a a , should be a ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody knows one of the medicine knows what a good surgeon or or or or a <unk> .
what we we do is we we , we , , to , to the world , to to the to the .
never have a mistake , nobody makes it true about the details of how how this is to be done .
and that is the message i took in medical medical .
i was a <unk> student student .
in high school , a <unk> , , that brian <unk> would learn to learn .
and it was also .
and i learned in my little <unk> in the <unk> , , <unk> , a <unk> hospital , <unk> from here .
i learned all this .
in my my , i learned the origins and tail of every <unk> , every , of every , of the the the the the aorta , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i even knew the <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i &apos;ve been the time , and more .
and i was good , i was <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
and i left the school of the that i i i know everything , everything , everything , or at least much as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible that i <unk> to to it it .
and it worked for for for a time until i met a .
i &apos;m a <unk> in a <unk> in toronto , a man , to me the the hospital of the hospital .
at that point , i was the <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
and it was my mission when the <unk> <unk> &apos;s advice , looking for the <unk> .
and feedback to to my <unk> .
i looked a printer , and she was in <unk> .
and when i put her her , , it made sound sound .
and when i <unk> her chest , i was able to hear an <unk> sound on both sides , that told me that she was from <unk> .
this is a state of the heart , , instead of the the blood , , a part of the blood blood in the lung and and , and , this , , the the . .
and that was not hard to get <unk> . .
i put her and made me the treatment .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her to take the pressure from the hearts .
i gave her her medicine that we call <unk> , water , so they they the the liquid .
and a a of a a a of a half hours , and i started feel better .
i felt really well .
and i i got my first mistakes ; i sent her home .
actually , i got two mistakes .
i sent her home without to my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t have the the on , and did what i should have been to call my <unk> call in my <unk> , , so he had a chance to make a a a a .
and he knew he he was able to have the to to the .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the <unk> doctor .
maybe i wanted to be successful and and so able to take responsibility responsibility that i was so so so i i could be able to work for my patients without him .
my second mistake was worse .
i i i to her home , i &apos;m a a little voice in me , to say to say , &quot; , , no good idea . do &apos;t . &quot;
in really missing so much in my <unk> , i i i the the nurse , who became what , of became , , &quot; do you believe it okay ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and i said in <unk> , , , &quot; yeah , i think it will going to .
i remember it was yesterday yesterday .
so i <unk> the <unk> and and and and and and and and they brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the the one day , i had this <unk> feeling in my stomach .
but i went on .
and at the end of the day i i i my things , and it , and i went to a car in the car to a car when i did something i didn &apos;t .
i went to my my my my my .
and there was a nurse , one nurse , not the who had seen the , , , another three words to me and and these three words fear most of the most of that i know .
other ones fear that also , but the the , , but the the , because we only see the patients so . .
the three words are , remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient they &apos;re to to to ? &quot;
the the nurse was <unk> .
&quot; she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular <unk> . .
so she was back .
she was back and die .
about one hour after she came home after she had sent her home , and then went and the the and the the the , and the the <unk> , they were back to the blood pressure with a blood pressure of 50 , which is an dangerous <unk>
she &apos;s barely and and and was <unk> .
the <unk> is all the strands .
they gave her <unk> .
they <unk> them to the <unk> .
i was shocked and to the inside the inner . .
and i build this this , because she came up after the <unk> , , and i would that they would recover .
and after two , three days , it was never to to it .
she had a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
their family used to them .
and over the course of the next eight days , they would be the the .
on the <unk> day , they <unk> them -- -- , , , , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say that you never forget the names of the <unk> .
and that was the first time i learned this out .
the next weeks i i i , i i , and i found the the of that that has in our medical culture -- i i felt in , , , not the kind of healthy shame that you &apos;t talk to the colleagues .
you all know the healthy shame , if you have a secret of the best &apos;s friend , even though this is a <unk> and and and you get a a , and and the best friend , if you get a a , and you and you you that you have never make a mistake .
if you &apos;re doing <unk> and and never make the mistake .
this is the kind of <unk> shame .
the food form of i &apos;m talking about is that is the in the heart .
it &apos;s the one that says that not what you &apos;re done bad , but you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t me to my <unk> , he was very very .
he spoke to the family , and i &apos;m sure he was the <unk> and and sure that i would not be for .
but i asked these questions .
why did i not asked the <unk> ? why do i home home ?
and then moments , , , how did i make a such a error ?
why am i left to medicine ?
but slowly , it it .
i i started to feel better .
and then a a day , a hole in the clouds and the the and the the and and i i i can feel better .
and i was that that if i was my efforts to perfection and never never a mistake that could be the voice .
and she did .
and i went on .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i was in in the <unk> in in a <unk> hospital north of toronto and and i <unk> a <unk> man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot of and i in a a .
he was always showed here .
i looked in the <unk> and and it was a little little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him .
and then when he went out the door , he showed his his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my next book , and my my asked asked me to a to to the office .
and she said three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the patient &apos;s <unk> ? &quot;
it turns out he &apos;s a <unk> .
he had a potentially <unk> disease disease .
you can google , but it &apos;s not an infection of the <unk> of the the the , and the the the the the .
and fortunately he didn &apos;t . .
he got <unk> <unk> and and a few days later .
and i went through the the same <unk> of shame and <unk> , felt it was <unk> and went to work back to and again and again .
in a a , i &apos;ve a a a a <unk> .
there &apos;s already some lot of , , especially when you think in a hospital that that that that time only only 14 patients only night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t sent her home , and there were no a in their treatment .
i was a in a i thought he had <unk> .
i <unk> the x-ray of the , , and when the was <unk> , , my colleague , the patient &apos;s <unk> , a <unk> <unk> in the lower right , the the the the the .
the other thing that was very strong .
i <unk> <unk> to to <unk> him and asked my colleagues to also also .
and he did , and he was a a <unk> in the right of the right , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> and and it was good .
both cases of me , <unk> me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistakes happened in the first five years , which was many many of my colleagues , but total of .
some of my <unk> had happened in the last five years .
and , , , , and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i &apos;m not end up my little little and and talk about you , if i &apos;m the quiet voice , what what really &apos;t find , how can i share with my colleagues ?
how can i tell you my mistakes , so that they &apos;t make the same ?
if i got to a room -- like right now , i i have no idea what you think about me .
when did you heard the last time of someone about <unk> about <unk> ?
oh , yes , you &apos;re going to a cocktail party and and you you you &apos;re about any other doctor , but you don &apos;t hear someone to you you know about their .
if i had a room with colleagues and and and and and to to and and to tell you , to tell you what i just told you , i i &apos;m not going to be the the second second story before you , you would be a joke , you would change the the and the rest rest .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues colleagues , that a <unk> <unk> in my hospital had someone the the the the the the , , believe me , i would have a to look at the eyes .
this is the system in we live in .
it &apos;s a totally <unk> of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- those of those , who make the and and those who are not doing , and the , the <unk> <unk> and the , and the the and and with with the results .
it &apos;s almost a big reaction as the antibodies that attack a people .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we have the those who are the the of that that that is a system .
but there are two problems .
in my about 20 years of the medical and and journalism , i made a personal medical study over medical mistakes and wrong treatments for me of my first article i i the the of my my , &quot; white white , , , , , , , , , , , .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely <unk> .
we &apos;re working in a system in the day in the day , a a <unk> <unk> or a <unk> , , in the <unk> and and and and and and and and and and .
in this state , , , , , , , , , , .
in the united states , the institute of medicine has been the for 100,000 .
both are are strong because we don &apos;t look at the problem of how we should .
and is the <unk> . .
in a <unk> in the medical knowledge of the medical knowledge , we have doubled , we can &apos;t keep up with .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive mistake so that we can take a perfect <unk> of for a patient with chest . .
i i take the same patient with <unk> , , make it <unk> and and and and , and a a a of a sudden , and suddenly a a of the story of .
i don &apos;t take the same same same .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always make things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all of the are inevitable inevitable .
so if you take the system as i was taught , and you &apos;ve been <unk> , and , and then you &apos;re &apos;t end up , the end of any more left .
and you know the the of about people who are not going to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show &quot; white white , , black , , &quot; i have the the , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to every <unk> to the <unk> , , , , , , , &quot; what about her , &quot; and then i show with the microphone .
and then their their , , they &apos;ve found her head front of the head , and they &apos;re going to and and , and start to tell you stories .
they want to tell your stories . they want to share their stories .
you want to be able to say , &quot; look , do not look the same mistakes i i . . &quot;
what you need is an environment that you can it it .
what what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the particle particle is a human person knows knows to know his humanity , she she &apos;s not proud of to , , but it all of them learn to learn that it could be passed on .
they &apos;re their experience with other .
they have to when other from their mistakes .
and she &apos;s their her mistakes , not to <unk> , , but in a <unk> , , way that all of us benefit .
and she works in a medical medical culture that that that people fill the system with life , and if that &apos;s , they &apos;re making mistakes of time time .
so the system that the system that that make money that make money find that people inevitably make it , and also make making them , to , , which is a <unk> and and and and and and the and for people , and the the of the the of of the .
my name is brian <unk> .
i &apos;m the new to to be .
i &apos;m a person . i &apos;m mistakes .
i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn best to to to to it to it .
i don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live .
let me close with you with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories three stories to use the time .
the first story is about charles darwin , a of my heroes .
you know that he was here .
you might think that he would be , , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he collected fish .
he described a as very as very &quot; . &quot;
it was a <unk> . .
until to the &apos; 80s , it was <unk> in a big style .
now it &apos;s on the red list .
this story , we &apos;ve heard many times of the the the the the , or other places , it &apos;s not very particularly .
yet , we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they were originally .
the <unk> , they &apos;re still them as as .
what is happening here ?
the second story is to to the other concept , the <unk> <unk> .
because i experienced it when i was in a in in in .
i went there because i grew up in europe and wanted to work later in africa .
i thought i could integrate .
and i got a awful <unk> , and i was convinced that i really wasn &apos;t .
it was my first <unk> .
as you can see , the the of <unk> and and of <unk> of <unk> .
there were <unk> <unk> of about 20 inches , <unk> , a <unk> of of the .
the <unk> of of these <unk> were very <unk> and and fishermen were actually more and and about about about about about about above ghana .
when i was 27 years later , the fish was up to half his size of his size .
and , they consume five centimeter .
they were been genetically <unk> .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also been happiness to be there .
so it has nothing changed , and yet everything changed changed .
my third little story about my my <unk> , the the of the in in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- the the of the &apos; 60s -- <unk> europe -- <unk> europe .
<unk> <unk> <unk> countries that have 100 100,000 fish , the industrial fishing , , the , of this beautiful beautiful ship .
i went on and and we made all the southern in the and and and in the <unk> .
we didn &apos;t have a words for what we started .
i know that it was the the of the sea .
90 percent of our <unk> were <unk> , other animals that are connected to the .
the largest part of the fish , the little dots there on the <unk> , the <unk> , were <unk> .
essentially , the the the of the sea , and then the the .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition goes very fast .
within one year , you get a a , and then then the working fishing fishing .
the reason is changed . from -- -- -- -- -- one hard reason or soft corals become <unk> .
this is a dead <unk> .
they didn &apos;t eat them , you threw it away , they were dead .
once once , we started a alive .
she wasn &apos;t been <unk> .
they wanted to kill them because they could make them good .
in fact , this mountain of the is actually up to the , , , when they &apos;re in in in the .
it &apos;s not going to be documented .
we &apos;re the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we fit our our of the new level , and don &apos;t call us what was there .
if you &apos;re it it , it &apos;s happening .
on the y-axis are a few good things : biodiversity , number of the , the green of the country , the <unk> .
it &apos;s changing it , it changes , because for people are , of course .
each generation is looking at the pictures that they will be to their their of your conscious life , as life is a standard and will be
the difference is going to be as loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
there can be a order of changes .
and at the end , they just want to get the <unk> remains .
that &apos;s what we have our goal .
we want to get things that are gone , or things that are are , they they were .
you could think that the problem of people who were were , when they were in in <unk> societies , they were killing animals and and of a generations of what they had done .
because obviously , an animal that was very often , first , , before , before it <unk> .
so you &apos;re not lose a greater animals .
you &apos;re always loses rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not clear as big loss .
we &apos;re focus on the big animals and the the the the big fish .
they &apos;re still to be less because we &apos;re going to start them .
and time time , there is a fish left , and we think that &apos;s the <unk> . .
the question is , why people accept that .
well , because they don &apos;t know that was different .
of course , a lot of people will say , it was really different .
they will tell it because the evidence of how they are in in a former form , not as they as they &apos;re going to be the .
for example , there &apos;s an example that the report of a <unk> that that that that in this area that can be be in this area , not not not not not <unk> , because he &apos;s not <unk>
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we &apos;re live in sophisticated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this is a huge role that can play a marine marine .
because , we , we , we are basically the past .
we are the the past that people can &apos;t understand , because the the of the and and are very low low .
so , people can see a protected marine and the the view that it it , their <unk> . .
what about the people who are not possible because they don &apos;t have access to the people in the west , for example ?
here can , i think the art and the the could fill the gap , and the simulation .
this is the simulation of the bay .
a long time time there were <unk> -- -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> remember , &quot; let &apos;s . &quot;
if you think of &quot; shepherd , &quot; if you think about why the people were being touched -- apart from the <unk> , why were they so touched by the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s something that that in a in a way .
so my i , the the only thing i &apos;m going to to cameron in cameron , so it &apos;s &quot; &quot; ii ii .
thank you .
in the 80s , in the <unk> , , , you had to put a typewriter , , the government .
they also had to have a sheet with <unk> from from the typewriter .
the reason for this : the government could come to , where a text came from .
they found an article called <unk> <unk> , they could even able to <unk> the the of this idea .
and we could not understand how anyone could do something like this , and how much that would be the of the speech .
in our own countries , we would never do this .
but in 2011 , a new new of of in 2011 , a new <unk> of the leading to and print a page , this page is the bright yellow <unk> on on every page , in a pattern that the the side that the the side , and it &apos;s the the .
this is what happens happening today .
and that seems to be no one .
and this was an example of what our own governments , the technology against us , the .
and this is one of the three three <unk> of the existing <unk> .
let &apos;s see what happens in the world is : we can divide the attacks in categories .
we have three <unk> .
there are <unk> . .
for example , this is mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in in .
and the <unk> of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people make money .
they use <unk> to make a lot of money , a huge huge amount of money .
there are several <unk> cases of <unk> , <unk> that that have <unk> their money through attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
this is alfred <unk> .
stephen watts .
<unk> <unk> .
this is matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so on .
these people are online online , , but they have it illegal by by making money for our our , , to get money from our our , , , our our , , , the the over the the , we have a a <unk> .
the american intelligence intelligence <unk> two months ago , the swiss cable of the the , , , , and on this <unk> , , <unk> million dollars , it was frozen .
mr. + himself is on <unk> foot , the <unk> is unknown .
and i &apos;m that it &apos;s more likely to be that we &apos;re going to be victims of a <unk> as a world of a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious , it &apos;s going to be worse .
in the future , most of the are in online .
the second second second that we can see today are not <unk> .
they &apos;re motivated through something else -- we could be , , , or through your audience .
groups like anonymous are over the last 12 months and and , and the the of the the the the the of the .
so these are the three <unk> : criminals , which of money , , , like anonymous , , , , the , , but the last group are nations governments that have the attacks .
there are cases of the , like the <unk> .
it &apos;s an as as what happens when governments are going to attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> <unk> from the netherlands , or it was it .
last fall , it had to be <unk> , , because <unk> was been been . .
somebody was been and had been the the <unk> .
and last week in a meeting with dutch , , i was one of the united of this group , whether it was possible to be that because of the <unk> people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people going to turn out of a remote ?
<unk> is a <unk> . .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
now , a certificate , you you a a website with <unk> , with <unk> service , for example .
now we &apos;re all all , or many of us , or , or , , , but these services are particularly spread in in countries like iran like like , , where the <unk> of , , , that they can be <unk> , so that the local government cannot be in their <unk> .
but can you , if you &apos;re in a foreign foreign
<unk> <unk> and fake <unk> . .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens happening in the .
how do it the arab spring and the the that is happening in egypt ?
well , in egypt , the the in in in the , in the the of the egyptian egyptian , and they found a lot of records .
in this records was a called called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this , , the on the , of a , , who had the egyptian government , a a few programs that they were -- in very big frame -- any communication of egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for <unk> euros in the egyptian government .
the <unk> is is right here .
so western governments governments governments governments with with with , to to to their own citizens .
but western governments are helping themselves .
for example , germany , only a few weeks ago , the so-called <unk> of the called <unk> , was a <unk> that was used by german <unk> to to their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be in a <unk> <unk> , , , it &apos;s really <unk> your phone .
but today we &apos;re far beyond beyond .
they tap their internet internet internet .
they use resources like the <unk> to to to the computer with a <unk> that allows them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> <unk> , their <unk> .
so if we &apos;re thinking about these things about these things , the obvious the the the answer is , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but not not not to me because i &apos;m a <unk> citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i didn &apos;t have anything to hide . &quot;
and that argument makes no sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not to the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we today , in 2011 , our governments , , , , we &apos;re right , we &apos;re a right , that we &apos;re going to
and trust we trust trust the whole of each future government , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to to to the next 50 years .
it may seem strange strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> were made <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and a simple idea : <unk> from <unk> with the <unk> that the . .
<unk> were very quickly the <unk> <unk> in in the world .
they put us into the to build things that were bigger than we , building , bridges , a stone .
essentially , the the the the building the building the building of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , came lego with this .
it &apos;s called &quot; automatically <unk> stone . &quot;
and within less years , lego into every household .
it &apos;s been that that that that that there are produced 400 billion rocks -- or 75 rocks of every person on the planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to make beautiful of , beautiful bridges , beautiful building .
lego made it possible for everyone .
lego made essentially the <unk> , the the block of the world , and it made a block block of our imagination .
in the the , in the bell , the the the next revolution , the next block .
the transistor was a little <unk> of that that us from a world of the , <unk> building building building building building building , in the world .
like the <unk> , , allowed us to build much larger more more complex components , , a stone .
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was just for experts .
personally , i don accept that the block block of our time is the and and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea of how to put the in the in the of artists and designers .
i started developing a of years ago .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic <unk> that that have a specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , the , the engine and sensor .
and the best thing is that they connect connected to magnet .
you can &apos;t able to put them down .
the stones are <unk> .
green is is , blue is , pink is input and orange is cable .
so all they need to do is a blue and and connect a green and and they can build very fast bigger . .
they put a blue a a , and they can make light .
you can put a switch in between , and they have a little <unk> . .
take the switch out to a a <unk> , that &apos;s here , and , and they made a little <unk> . .
add this <unk> for a extra major effect , and they made a <unk> . .
i &apos;ll stop that .
and the the is is , is actually quite powerful .
so instead of the , you have to <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , , you to to to with simple simple , , ,
so to to the the , , they &apos;re just down to down , you simply turn on this button , and it makes the
the idea behind the idea behind is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction in this world in a <unk> .
lights , sounds , sound , <unk> , motors -- everything should be available .
we have <unk> <unk> children and and you play with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful is , as you start to understand the in the they &apos;re not learning in the in school .
like like a <unk> system works , or why the doors of the <unk> <unk> , or like an ipod to touch on touch .
we &apos;ve also <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so we had had an example of the in in electronic things that started playing with with <unk> .
here we see , with <unk> paper , paper and water bottles , like <unk> ...
a few weeks ago we took <unk> to risd , and they gave them some designers that didn &apos;t have any of -- -- -- it &apos;s , , wood and paper -- and said , &quot; &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my <unk> . .
it &apos;s a <unk> from of that who has the fear in the darkness .
for this <unk> , , was another material , , was just another material .
and we want to make this material for all available .
so <unk> &apos;s <unk> source .
you can go to the website , you can all the and and and make them .
we want to the world of the , the inventor , the the , , because this world where we live in , this interactive world , we &apos;re ourselves .
so , pull out and they start invent it .
thank you .
