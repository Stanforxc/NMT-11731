and wherever you &apos;re going to see the <unk> of the forest is not going to be the <unk> of the <unk> , which is a lot of living peoples , from the <unk> of the <unk> , which is a <unk> living , of the <unk> , from the <unk> of the <unk> , which is the <unk> of the horizon , which is the way that the japanese &apos;s going to be willing to see their <unk> , to the <unk> , which they have taken the forest , or how they have the forest to fill out of the <unk> , they have the forest of the <unk> , which have the <unk> , or the case of the <unk> where it &apos;s <unk> that are <unk> during the <unk> .
simply , the the of the road is still to continue to focus on the road , or that the the of the myths that we &apos;re going to follow the greater few of the road , which is the idea that the world &apos;s going to live in a absolute sense , but not as a sense of reality , but only as a model of a group of reality , as a consequence of the fact that we have to have , we have been getting successful , many generations of the .
at the end of this amazing , you &apos;ll take a look at the very amazing landscape of the first light , and in the first time , the <unk> of the first time , when the sun comes to the astonishing beautiful landscape , you will suddenly everything you &apos;re learned in the abstract beautiful , and it &apos;s all about the kid &apos;s learned in the morning , and the priest comes back and the priest , and the priest is , you know , it &apos;s really , i think , you know ? it &apos;s like you &apos;ve got .
what &apos;s happening is that fascinating is not just the most important potential , and it &apos;s really different from two different sources of this <unk> , but it &apos;s really made of a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . this is just as a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> from the family &apos;s <unk> with <unk> .
it &apos;s not matter in the <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> in the <unk> , or the japanese in the &apos; 60s , the <unk> in the woods , or a <unk> in the &apos; 60s , which is the game , which i &apos;m going to be traveling in a month ago , or even a <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , everest , the world &apos;s <unk> , the world .
it stays not a lot of space for the <unk> of <unk> or the cold face of tibet , but the cold face of tibet , which is not the idea of being able to be , to be able to do it , but on a very much intuition , the idea of being conscious , that the idea of being itself , because it &apos;s a lot of consciousness .
it means that a small child from the universe that will be a <unk> , which is that the mountain is a <unk> , and one of the mountain people will be being a lot of the resource , and one of the things that resource is a little kid from eastern africa , that a lot of rocks are a bunch of rocks that can be .
i even worked with my professor , richard <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s been <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> in mexico in the 1930s , i was talking about this <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> of the <unk> , because it was a <unk> , because in the moment you feel the effects , you &apos;re not there to experience a <unk> .
the young boys were going to be separated by three and four years of the world , and in a <unk> world , the most of the glacier for 18 years of <unk> , the two times of the nine , from the nine years of the time , used to be the nine months of pregnancy , which is their own mother , in their own mother &apos;s lap , they were <unk> in the great mother .
margaret <unk> , the great sister , and she died that it &apos;s not the greatest fear of being us in a space , <unk> , moving forward , not only the entire range of human imagination on a way of thinking of a <unk> of the human imagination , but we have a day from a day , and forgotten that there was ever been .
so , in the 20th century , you won &apos;t remember the wars or technological , but rather than a a time we were always asked , the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity of biological of the biological and cultural diversity of the earth is either either or autonomous , so that &apos;s not the problem .
in the early years , i got a really amazing job when i was in my professor , if i was interested in the early , and the secret of the secret to be able to translate the secret of the strength , and the total of the world , and the poison that was used to be used to make it make us .
i went from a young colleagues from <unk> miles in <unk> <unk> , and i was just a long ago , and i was looking at the face behind the statistics of the statistics of you , and i was listening to a lot of the statistics that were in and found it in a way that was <unk> , and that &apos;s been <unk> by the <unk> .
you know , one of the great <unk> of the big research in the travel is , in the world , with the people who are still remember the old days , and the past of the past , they touch it in the rain , they touch them in the <unk> of the plants .
no biologist would be like to provide an example of 50 percent or more of all the species in the field , because it &apos;s just true -- and yet , the <unk> of the biological diversity of biological diversity , not to be able to see what we &apos;re known as a <unk> of the area of cultural diversity .
and i know some of you are saying , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; if we were not a better language , if we all just speak language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be a language .
we were going to take eight generations of a natural future , and when we were to do a lot of the people , and when we were doing something about it , they gave them that one of the people who had become so old that he died because of his death .
and in this song we &apos;re going to be able to be the possibility to be that we are : people with the importance of all the people and broken a space that all of people and have to be a space of the optimism .
and that &apos;s me to another human being , including my friends under the <unk> , who believe that these forests were <unk> by <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the world &apos;s most vulnerable , the world &apos;s most vulnerable , which are the most powerful ones .
now , the problem of the problem is that , in the context of the future , the creatures for the difficult position of the have been the way to be the most important , and they &apos;re kind of in the past , as the real world is , the world , is our world , is the world .
so whenever we think about the state of the landscape and landscape , we &apos;re going to <unk> the old and the old wheel , which is a little bit of a universal thought , or the old one , and say , these people are more connected to the nature .
look at this amazing pair of <unk> , <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> coal , without <unk> , a amazing <unk> of the ability to influence the body as well as it is in a condition of extreme arousal .
how can these people have <unk> plants that are <unk> from a <unk> of <unk> , who are the two <unk> , which is , if they combined , a kind of <unk> version of the whole , so that the whole is the size of its parts .
the <unk> revolution that we were brought to agriculture , and in this moment , the <unk> of the <unk> , the poetry of the <unk> of the <unk> and hierarchy of the ultimate and the hierarchy of the team , and i was found -- just 10,000 years ago .
you can imagine this cultural <unk> as a <unk> , and a <unk> , as the <unk> of all the thought of the mind and dreams , myths , and , that are the human imagination since the beginnings of the mind that we have been defined by .
one continent is always going to be because the guess that it &apos;s not in africa , in fact , in africa , it was a and a half of the time , of course , and it &apos;s just a lot of <unk> thinking about this very very very religious religious problems that are going to be in the case .
and during that time , they &apos;re culturally in the values of their society , values , which is the proposition of the proposition that their lower and their patients , the cosmic , the cosmic -- or we can tell the basic balance .
what could be be to be the <unk> , one of the last your friends , who are talking to your language , not the possibility of the ancestors that are going to be able to bring the wisdom to the ancestors ?
you know , the genocide of humans , the <unk> of humans is not going to be <unk> , but the <unk> , the destruction of the people , not only , but in general , not only in the way , but generally , as part of the <unk> .
all of this works in the past , the past , that &apos;s where these big houses are talking about , because the <unk> six or seven spoken , is that you &apos;re never talking to a language .
together , these <unk> cultures are the net of the world &apos;s own cultures , and <unk> lives that the earth &apos;s most important , as the biological <unk> , as the biological <unk> , which is the case of a biosphere .
and yet , of this terrible fate , actually somebody on earth , about all the two weeks , because of all two weeks , one of the two weeks , and the last one , in the past of a old language , and the last language of the old language .
the oceans can be <unk> from under the big water , answers , answers to the rhythm of the dance to to be in the way that the <unk> is for a brief moment .
they were <unk> the pictures of themselves from the air , which we would be doing as a human gesture , and they &apos;ve never seen that people from the middle of their lives , never seen anything else .
now what &apos;s fascinating is that the <unk> that are in the <unk> are actually <unk> , <unk> , the way that we have to do is to be able to do the <unk> , and so you can ask yourself .
they managed to see these photographs from the forest , trying to see the face or the character , and they didn &apos;t see anything that was going to be the <unk> and killed the five <unk> .
here &apos;s a photograph that i &apos;m looking at the north of the <unk> , when i was going to go through the <unk> , and this man , <unk> , and this man , i told me a wonderful story of his ever .
so i want to take you today to a trip on a way of traveling through the way , a quick journey through the <unk> , to try to make you , which is actually lost .
the old <unk> civilization that <unk> the <unk> of of the <unk> , and in the case of the u.s. , the people in the <unk> was <unk> , which is the <unk> , which is a lot of the u.s.
take the example of this kid in the northern area of the amazon , the people of the <unk> , the people that they think of the <unk> of the east from the east of the country .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes i &apos;ve ever lived in the <unk> of the south , an amazing people who was <unk> in the year of the year .
but the thing about <unk> is that you can &apos;t be <unk> , because it &apos;s not a lot of the <unk> , of course , <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
well , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , and you can see these plant .
the <unk> heard not to be less than being the magic and the magic and the conditions of being americans than they horse and <unk> tasks .
now there are some of us who forget that , when i say , &quot; different possibilities of my own , &quot; really different ways of the my .
this is a people who are not <unk> between the colors and green , because the <unk> of the forest is the forest that people are being <unk> .
this tribe , the <unk> , , have 17 layers of <unk> , which you can see at very much of the time in the forest that we have in the face .
we need to be able to talk about the <unk> of death , and so we should not tell us that we all sing , and we would have a lot of the time .
if you &apos;ve seen the same thing , you know , the same thing , you know , this stuff , that &apos;s what you have in different ways of making these things from different ways .
this is a little bit of a <unk> , like a <unk> of a <unk> , <unk> , of <unk> paintings , and the one on the sea is to be a sea of electricity .
he was in the prison of two years to hide up under the prison , because she didn &apos;t have to live in her own .
and of these 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re in here in the world , we &apos;re in developing the world , right now , half the time .
to give this point of view , i had to give sense of this , of course , about these remarkable faith of the <unk> , and it &apos;s not a moral rule of the black magic .
now , from all of the people i &apos;ve met , the <unk> were <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , in <unk> , who was the most .
they call the older brothers and they say we are the younger brothers , the world &apos;s greatest brothers .
and on the end of a choice , we &apos;re really going to be a choice of the world &apos;s disease , or in a <unk> world , we &apos;re going to live with the diversity of life ?
well , this fantasy is not to tell me that we all have to have the answers to the challenges that we &apos;re in the past .
so , it turns out that every of the 17 dimensions of <unk> and you &apos;re singing in a different way of a different way .
or if we go into the mountains of tibet , i &apos;m a lot of the hard to see the face of the political .
you have a little bit of language , and a <unk> called the very <unk> , you have to marry someone who &apos;s talking about other .
all these people teach us that there are other things that are other than other things , other ways of the earth .
and then you ask them to say , how do you put your <unk> and you say , &quot; i thought you can &apos;t get something wrong .
one day , she came from from it on a <unk> <unk> , and he had to do it for seven years , and he had to do it for seven years .
i grew up in the forests of <unk> , and i believed that these forests are going to be there .
to the day , you &apos;re going to be a <unk> , and it &apos;s a very , very extraordinary , but it &apos;s very extraordinary .
this is <unk> , which is many of you , the most powerful of the <unk> of the <unk> .
and just as the biosphere was strong , this is what we did with the <unk> -- is just with a <unk> .
so every language is like a <unk> forest of the spirit , a moment , a thought , a remarkable , a ecosystem .
they &apos;re not going to be taught in the way that they &apos;re not going to be , you know , they &apos;re actually dead .
their standards were able to reach out of a different distance from 40 to each other , and determine what the animal was doing .
and this is an idea that you think about , you know , to think about it , just with hope .
she &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we &apos;re doing , and we &apos;re able to do a <unk> species .
and then you would suddenly see how it would be if you could not speak your own language .
and because you &apos;re obsessed with it , you get off from the mind . how can you get any damage ?
now , this brings you to a ph.d. , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than <unk> .
not change and technology &apos;s own , the integrity of the <unk> . it &apos;s power .
it &apos;s a means to be able to bring the soul in a certain culture .
in a more recent continent , these people were the only ones who were never been out of the <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the way that they &apos;ve done it in a <unk> level .
if we ask those <unk> , the importance of the human race , they say , with 10,000 voices .
when each of you were born in this room , it was talked about the world &apos;s 6,000 languages .
but what &apos;s interesting is that interesting is that there &apos;s this living relationship between living living and dead .
<unk> say , the <unk> , &quot; you &apos;re going to be able to church and talk about god .
these plant plant contains some very strong <unk> , which is the brain , and the <unk> are very similar to .
you can only do with some other chemicals with some of the other chemicals that are called the <unk> .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique thing is the brain , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
the interesting thing is , the metaphor of the metaphor , which is nature &apos;s mind .
i mean , you know nothing ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
the suffering can be a terrible , but the most powerful mind is a little bit more .
and it &apos;s a bit of thinking that our species have been since for years .
now , language is not just the same of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
if i ask you , the large great global , what would you say ?
it &apos;s a photograph that i &apos;ve just last april , in the beginning of the amazon .
we use this great platform , trial and error , which is a little bit of a sound .
but ask the indians , &quot; the know , &quot; the plant is to us . &quot;
his uncle was <unk> with her <unk> , people who bring his .
his mother was locked up as a punishment for -- for the crime .
so , the ones that are not , they &apos;re not going to be able to get the same thing .
whether it &apos;s a <unk> of a mind or a bunch of <unk> , is an issue .
the sister who did this guy was doing it in a <unk> .
in the year of northern india , five <unk> and made a <unk> mistake .
but at the same time , they had a clear sense of the water that was amazing .
it &apos;s not going to make a child , but it &apos;s the reality of reality .
all cultures have always involved in the dance of new zealand .
the modern world world is how we &apos;re not talking about it .
the father &apos;s father was <unk> when the was the <unk> of the <unk> .
this meant that he was going to be caught by the chinese three times .
in the contrary , it &apos;s a different way of view .
christianity , islam , <unk> , <unk> , whatever .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing children to the world .
and the key to that is the result of the extinct .
but the <unk> didn &apos;t just leave with the <unk> .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you guys need it . &quot;
they &apos;re just listening to them , and then they &apos;re going to speak .
we &apos;re dancing in the temple and will be . &quot;
and the problem is , not the technology .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
now , this level of intuition is very important .
and of course , we share the same color .
a language is expression of the human mind .
by the percent of deaths , it &apos;s been <unk> .
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
the opposite of the world is .
so , what does that mean ?
so , what does this mean ?
they &apos;re each other .
we go through <unk> .
it &apos;s interesting .
and we &apos;re going to take a series of trips into the <unk> of the way that we &apos;re going to take our audience to the other of such cultural wonder , that they &apos;re going to be the most of the conversation , the fact that it deserves the world &apos;s latest , that we can have a <unk> in a really <unk> world , to make the wisdom of all human beings , to bring the wisdom of all the people to our shared .
if someone has done that , when you did , and all of the saint , and all of this saint , and i can have them to do all of this , and i can use them as a beginning of the time , and i can actually start them to go into this room , in those <unk> , the photos of other people and so forth , using the kinds of <unk> <unk> of the other .
i &apos;d like to start with you a <unk> of the <unk> of trials that we first had in the summer to show them what i was doing in summer , which is that it really is the same of this technology , which is the technology behind this technology , and that &apos;s not necessarily obvious as if you look at the website .
what i &apos;m going to do to you as quickly as a new technology , is a new technology that we &apos;re going to be as part of a year ago , which is a <unk> , and it &apos;s a environment that you can either be able to be able to use or removed with a huge amount of visual data .
this is a <unk> <unk> of the the of the jones , just in the computer with the photographs of the page , and just give you a little bit of men in boxes and you &apos;re going to see the <unk> , and you see , and each one of the orange here is a picture that has been discovered in the computer .
the <unk> have these pictures together to put the real room in which the footage that they were made in the near <unk> , in the canadian room , and they &apos;re going to see here , and they see here , elements of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and these things have been all in the relationship with each other .
there are <unk> <unk> in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t want to make the 10 different extra <unk> , and you could buy the big number of <unk> in the case of a large number of <unk> , which is that it &apos;s not the flow of the store in the store .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not <unk> , but we believe that all of the world can change and , and we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website will be 35 35 <unk> .
i &apos;m going to tell you some of the things that i hope , in the other things , in the other things that you &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;m trying to create some of the connections , if you &apos;re not that .
and i guess you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras : everything is all about the <unk> of the <unk> , a fairly large number of them that are all in this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with social environment . it &apos;s now going to data data from all of the collective , of the whole collective memory of the earth -- and everything is going to be connected .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not to a picture , we can do something like this , really , to show that this is a real representation of the law and no one &apos;s a picture .
it doesn &apos;t make a difference , because the only thing that the performance of the system like this , is the number of you can do on your screen on every moment . it has also been a very <unk> architecture .
. i understand you right ? i mean , can you put it in a certain point , and then the next time , in the next few years , all the images that are used to be used in the world are basically being used to be connected to the world ?
and finally , i think it &apos;s quite obvious , at least for those of us who are traveling to these distant goals , the earth &apos;s first time .
they represent parts of the human imagination that comes in at past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these kids , like dreams , like the dreams of our own children , the focus of our own children .
and of course , in the entire world , the vast rich virtual provide of any interesting part of the earth that &apos;s not just been through <unk> or external and so on , but through collective memory .
and then you go to the <unk> business , a <unk> -- -- speaker , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , , and in this one , a electronics , there &apos;s so many <unk> .
he <unk> the dog and the dog was a <unk> , the skeleton of the dog and he was a <unk> , <unk> another dog and <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> .
one is a very good and the other one is a very good research about <unk> , who &apos;s a <unk> , a <unk> at the university of <unk> , among the old <unk> of steve <unk> .
he went out to the outside , and he took his pants out of his <unk> and <unk> in his hand , and he was able to put it in the way of a <unk> .
the the u.s. government is not always good at the same time , and during the u.s. of the <unk> , our independence , they were forced to be able to pull out in the field of the world .
and that gives you the pleasure and the good experience of a real experience of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of a medium , which is a lot of the medium .
most of you are digital phone of a camera , but this is what a scan of the <unk> of the <unk> and it &apos;s in a area of 300 <unk> .
and that &apos;s something that is through the complexity that we use it , and it &apos;s used for the user use of the user , using it .
when people have freedom , each of us for ourselves to do things for themselves , and we have no way to determine that and not for us .
the official <unk> works , which is , when our goal is to be the effect of our citizens , it &apos;s about the result of the freedom of the individual .
there was a time when i was a boy , and there was a little bit of the phone that was going to have a little bit of the bell , and he was going to be a while .
you can see that if we can create this kind of opinions , we can actually do this with images and we can &apos;t get these experience of the <unk> .
as you &apos;re an <unk> for a <unk> , you know , where you &apos;re going to see the sentences and the text of the website contains lots of information about what &apos;s going on .
so we see many , many , many of the digital photographs that we see is the way we can do this and <unk> , in the way that it can be done in the way .
we have an false ad with very high communities , which is much higher than a normal ad , and we have added extra content .
health -- it &apos;s not longer the case in the united states , and the doctor &apos;s going to go to the doctor and the doctor &apos;s going to do what you &apos;re doing .
the canadian government gave the the president of a year to the entire war of a area that was bigger than california and texas .
then the amount of <unk> and the amount of light and the amount that makes it really , really , really tremendously . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
the more freedom , the more freedom have you have , and the more freedom you have , the more powerful they have .
this is , i think , in our water , in our supply space , that &apos;s no one would come to it .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that until you have seen it in your business , you can be sure that they &apos;ll soon be soon .
in other aspects of life , a lot of <unk> than the buy the same explosion , the same explosion of choice .
the reason is that freedom is in itself , valuable , sense , a <unk> trick for human life .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we &apos;re looking at how big these tools are or how big the images are .
and i don &apos;t really want to spend a lot of time , except to say that we &apos;re going to be going to be this .
now , you know , the average thing that the moral ones have to have is the very afraid of the .
and this is really exciting when you think about the amount of information that you think of the amount of pictures .
he was looking at the side of the <unk> and <unk> , and it was completely <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
an amazing example of how a nation , a state , a state of the who can seek and reach .
and so she goes to the doctor and the doctor says , &quot; we could do a , or we could make b .
and this is a lot of a different symbol of the resistance and all of the world &apos;s greatest ones .
all these pictures are connected to each other , and it &apos;s a little bit more than the sum of the parts .
we can get <unk> million different <unk> of <unk> , and the components that are offered in this business .
and what it does is it &apos;s getting people to walk into business and ask this question .
the family who had scared to his life , he took all the weapons and all the tools .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we think politicians never achieve .
and this is really the ideas that are going to be on the top of the u.s.
we hope that it &apos;s not a <unk> and other nonsense , which is not supposed to be necessary .
so this is all <unk> , and they &apos;re all in the way that they &apos;re in different terms of each other .
the <unk> of their typically were made of fish , which made them in <unk> .
this is a project called <unk> , which is really two different technologies .
you know , i &apos;ve never believed that i &apos;m going to work in microsoft .
we &apos;ve got almost an infinite choice of choice , especially in the world of mobile phones .
the grandfather of the man had not <unk> before the arctic night or the direct one .
i don &apos;t know if i have a lot of other environments .
my favorite is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
we also did something about the same of the particular thing of the guardian .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them .
of course , the one of the really big applications for a technology like this .
think of this as the next of the work of stephen <unk> in the words .
their own pictures are going to have a <unk> , who has a different person .
but how about that , if this picture you were connected to all your images ?
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t too much .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
and <unk> <unk> done by microsoft research . a very good collaboration .
but the spatial print of images is in fact , in fact , is meaning .
this is actually a poster of the young lady that was really recorded .
i want to start with what i call myself &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
this is <unk> &apos;s house . every column is a chapter .
this is now live on the internet . you can do it .
so this is live in the internet . it &apos;s going to be by <unk> .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
they have your phone phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
maybe this is a artificial way to read a <unk> .
somewhere , there are a series of photographs -- here &apos;s what you &apos;re .
you get a model of the entire world .
one of the things that was that was that the didn &apos;t have been broken .
b is the benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
it &apos;s a new area . it &apos;s controlling all the <unk> .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
and if possible , i &apos;m going to find some of the strange .
and it &apos;s doing this because of the point in the images .
you &apos;ve got to admit that that &apos;s a big choice .
now , you know what the answer to this question ?
we had to worry about the lawyers and so we were .
and we can do it in very simple ways .
if you want to make it <unk> between the pictures .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . i mean .
the path of freedom is to maximize choice .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
it &apos;s our new york and <unk> .
every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
or other models , or some models , or .
<unk> up on the top of the nasa &apos;s picture .
there are some of the things that are much more .
i &apos;m very grateful for the vietnam .
yeah . she doesn &apos;t matter anything else .
the official <unk> of all western societies .
i just just to say a little bit about <unk> .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
in other areas , the world of communication .
the grandfather &apos;s reading this old man .
that &apos;s how you do something about anything .
but these are all the streets in the streets .
let &apos;s go back to something different .
many of them are from faces and so on .
this is my supermarket . no big .
they &apos;re the <unk> of somebody .
our told our speakers are millions of millions .
these are the mobile cell .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
a &apos;s a huge one to do these risks .
in nations , our <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
the official <unk> of what ?
thank you very much .
these days are over .
thank you .
thank you .
one of them is that they had a different choice of different kinds of <unk> , and it &apos;s not perfect ? it &apos;s just perfect ? it &apos;s perfect , and what &apos;s going on is that there &apos;s a <unk> that would have better alternative alternative , and what &apos;s going to do with that , and this is an extra thing that &apos;s going to be a good choice , even if it was a good choice .
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy , &quot; which is a good one , but it &apos;s a shift of the possibility of the decisions of something -- the doctor &apos;s coming from the doctor -- to someone who &apos;s meaningful and likely to be sick , and therefore , not in the best national , the patient &apos;s .
i think a <unk> -- not the only thing , but a <unk> of the depression that &apos;s also human , and also , because people are having the <unk> , because they have their standards , because they have to be so high , and then they think they must be their blame , think they think they &apos;re their blame .
and there was a time in which it was only a jeans of a kind of a , and they &apos;ve got bad <unk> , they &apos;ve got incredibly <unk> , and if they &apos;ve had enough enough enough and they &apos;ve had a long time , they &apos;ve become &quot; ok .
finally , a consequence of the <unk> of a bad ride is that if you &apos;re in the school , if you &apos;re in a real way , why are you responsible , the world is clear . the world is responsible . what would you have to do ?
you know , that &apos;s not only that that people eat eating eating food when they go to the retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to have the money , it means that the decisions are so hard to get out of their own .
so this is one effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and a decision , we get less with the outcome of the choice , as if we have the chance to have the chance to choose less .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time in which the <unk> was that almost everybody one had , and they were able to do that as quickly as they were , and then they got kids as they were .
if something of what people could make sense of the society , making decisions of the societies in people who have been able to make a difference , not only life of people , but we &apos;re going to be more effective .
he had no idea what was , so i spent a hour of this <unk> jeans , and i was the business -- and i say the truth -- with the right pair i had ever had .
today , in the world we live -- we &apos;re wealthy , citizens , with an expectation -- the best thing you can hope is that you can hope that things are so good at you , you know , as you &apos;re supposed to be .
now as a tragic question -- i &apos;m almost finished -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as a rule of thinking about the other things that are happening in the societies , is the material wealth .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternative to think about it , it &apos;s just critical to the different of the alternative to the alternative that you have chosen .
work -- we are blessed , like literally , , with technology that allows us every minute of every day every day on the planet -- to be on the planet .
so what it means is , this incredible freedom of choice we have to make , in our own decisions , and again , we should work , or should we work with it .
we can play our kids at play play , and we have our mobile cell on the waist , and our choice on other hip , and our laptop may probably be on our lap .
the reason that was worse was better than anything worse than anything was worse , was able to make people experience , was able to make a pleasant surprise .
and what &apos;s so profound and suggests is that steve <unk> has told you about how these expensive expensive and hard to <unk> seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
there &apos;s an indigenous marketing marketing for people &apos;s drugs for people like it and me , if you think about it , at all , not makes sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
so , to buy new jeans , for many years of the old , the old years of old , and i said , &quot; i would have a few jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and even though they &apos;re all of the street , every minute of the time we &apos;re asking our kid at the <unk> , we ask ourselves , &quot; i &apos;m going to take this call ?
the reason i felt that i was feeling that i was able to do all these available opportunities , my expectations for a good pair of jeans , i went to .
and you &apos;re going to answer those questions , whether it &apos;s all the tasks that i &apos;m going to give you and not good grade in my classroom .
and even though the answer to the question , no , it &apos;s going to be the experience of the child &apos;s experience , a child &apos;s going to be very different .
dan signed is a great point of this morning , using how much the way we evaluate things about what we &apos;re doing .
because it &apos;s 50 <unk> , which is to be the choice of what you choose to choose , that you &apos;re going to choose to be in tomorrow .
and so , if people make decisions , and even if the results of the decisions are good , they feel about it .
but a more important point that he &apos;s doing is always trying to do one of the things that they don &apos;t do to do other things .
and so i had to do what i had to know , and what i was expected to do was in comparison to what i was expected to do .
that means every day you &apos;re going to be able to decide at the morning , you have to decide what to be like .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re busy with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; do i marry married or not ? should i marry ?
they &apos;re not giving them to 5,000 dollars a year on the <unk> , who was happy to be able to grow their contribution .
my dad was down , and after i said , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the kind of time that the only way . &quot;
if hundreds of different are available , and you buy one of the the stones , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
there &apos;s no question of making something better , but it &apos;s not a matter of choice , but it doesn &apos;t matter that much more choice .
and he was two weeks of the thought that he &apos;s not going to have the opportunity to have a day day , day .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of you whose problem is not the big choice .
one of my favorites had to be access to <unk> , who was <unk> <unk> <unk> , the giant <unk> of a million and about 2,000 2,000 jobs .
no one in the world of the brain knows that , if you were , if you wouldn &apos;t know , all the way it was going to be here .
the more options there , the more simple , the more than it is to regret that is the number of time .
the other thing that &apos;s adding in the lives of people in the lives of people have gone to the people who are good at how well they are .
i want to say -- a little bit of a little bit of moment -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
this is the official <unk> , which is all right , right now , it &apos;s not true .
and the answer is , you expect to get the next morning , and we get to ask a change of the prescription .
we have all , big things and small things , material things , material and lifestyle , is a question of choice .
<unk> the happiness that we &apos;re getting through our selection , also , if we have chosen , we have fantastic .
what i &apos;m telling you is that this expensive , complicated , makes it , not easy to help .
they offer 50 percent of the time -- 10 percent less employees than if they would be five to five , why ?
and these other things like many of them have have properties , and it &apos;s what they &apos;re going to do less .
and what she found was a 10 10 <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the employer , took the participation to two percent .
and the more choices in the choice are the more innovative of these choice , are going to be in the <unk> of the <unk> .
i had very low expectations . i had no hope for having them in a way .
the secret to the <unk> -- that &apos;s what you &apos;ve gone to -- the secret to the <unk> are low expectations .
and so the idea is that it &apos;s better to us , and we &apos;re going to feel worse .
so with so many options that you can choose , it will be very hard to decide .
and then , tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course .
here &apos;s an example . for you , you don &apos;t have new yorker , i &apos;m going to do it .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve got this point of time , we have a long time of our collective value .
and if you were , &quot; if you were , you know , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
something like our identity is a question of the idea of a matter of the time that i &apos;m supposed to be able to show .
the only true choice was &quot; who said , &quot; not what they did .
i &apos;m teaching great intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent of work when i did .
and so , there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m going to tell you about , which is the most difficult thing .
so i want to say , there was some choice , but not everything that was a question .
if you want to go down to the bottom , <unk> , blah , blah , &quot; and so on . &quot;
so , the things i &apos;m talking about is a <unk> problem of modern , rich , western societies .
the doctor says , a has a these benefits and risks and b has to be the benefits of the world .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of investment , a study of investment in volunteers .
he &apos;s making a statement about this now , and maybe it &apos;s too much about it .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
should i be married by getting married ? &quot; i &apos;m going to do kids , or about a career ?
we know all of the good about it , so i &apos;m going to have a lot of things .
you want to make the decision to make it really , if it &apos;s all the time , right ?
what might be better ? &quot; &quot; &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s a august .
when you were in 100 100 species , a lot of them would have perfect .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even if the results are good .
and in fact , they should do . these are important to more questions .
i had better . i had better choice to have it better .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
one effect , <unk> , is that he would be able to get off .
you don &apos;t want to choose the wrong set of vote , or even the wrong <unk> .
and the sales said , &quot; do you want to be <unk> , easy <unk> ?
you will never think of it because your expectations , my expectations , you &apos;re going to be .
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : you know .
should i answer that email ? should i write this letter . &quot;
beautiful beach . great day . they have everything for themselves .
i couldn &apos;t do it better . i didn &apos;t have <unk> .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
all of these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
and i think it &apos;s the way that the world looks like .
and what i got was good , but it was not perfect .
there &apos;s a lot of . i don &apos;t know what it is .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
why do they care about us if we can &apos;t buy ?
and the world we &apos;re now living now .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
this was me when i wanted to do my jeans .
clinical depression in the industrial world , the last generation .
and we &apos;re so often to be able to do that .
and the world we lived looked like this .
do you want to be <unk> or <unk> ? stone or <unk> ?
but here &apos;s what they would have thought .
but <unk> is not always a bad thing .
your problem is they have too little .
we don &apos;t have identity , we invent them .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
i could leave my home before my house . &quot;
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
they worry about that we are doing bad .
and there are several reasons for this .
here &apos;s a couple of the hamptons .
everybody in my neighborhood is gone .
now , this cartoon is doing some more .
the truth is more like this .
now , all of these days , all of us .
the answer is , &quot; yes . &quot;
secondly , what economists call <unk> .
you could have it better .
so let me remind you .
they &apos;re all <unk> questions .
here &apos;s another example .
three : <unk> of expectations .
do you want to travel with holes ?
but i felt worse .
what do you want ?
they actually hurt .
very expensive .
we were <unk> the chromosome of a <unk> , and roughly the two of them , we gave them a few of them to destroy the <unk> , and we had it to be the <unk> , and it was very amazing to destroy the proteins . we were very amazing as we gave it in a cell -- and they &apos;re really going to be our very <unk> .
but we wanted to go to a whole entire <unk> of the <unk> , and we wanted to build a whole <unk> of genetic code . so we thought we were building it in <unk> of the size of the virus , which we could build the size of the cell , to understand what the individual of a living cell is a living .
but if we look at this map map , which is very simple to us , in our business , you can trust me , but if we look at all these genes , we can actually look at one after another , it &apos;s very unlikely that this is a living cell .
but how we think the only way we have a lot of energy is not going to be a lot of energy cost or the european of their mental imagination , if we &apos;re seeing co2 as a nuclear station , and so we work on the cells that go to that way .
here &apos;s a <unk> from the molecule that we created by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;ve only been using <unk> , the right design of the pieces we have ; we have it &apos;s called it , and it starts automatically .
this is the map of a small organism , by <unk> <unk> , who can be able to replicate the smallest genome of a species that can be in the lab , and we &apos;re trying to do that with a smaller genome .
there are tens of thousands of machines around around the world that can make the little bits of dna , 30 to 50 , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so you can do a piece of money , the more money .
if we get to these right things -- with over 100,000 -- -- not just in the earthquake -- they &apos;re not just in vessels , and it &apos;s all the opportunities of modern biology , and so we used to be able to do other mechanisms .
it &apos;s also simple , as you do it in the <unk> , and you just take the <unk> out there , and there &apos;s a different one that you &apos;ve heard about it .
if you imagine these 20 million different things , or these processes , or to produce these processes , or to produce drugs , we can change a little bit more than a little bits of the last 20 years .
you know , we really have -- <unk> goals like the whole <unk> industry . right ? if you could do that at all , where otherwise you could do , you could do a <unk> of the energy .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point of biology , and we &apos;re going to try and biology now from the digital code to create a new phase of biology , and we &apos;re building new life and build .
so , we decided that it &apos;s the only way to start this chromosome , actually , to actually put the cells out of the way to see some of these fundamental questions and so on .
in <unk> , the chromosome is in the cell , but only recently we &apos;ve shown you that you can make a complete transplant of a single cell from a cell to the other and can get it .
and we started making together , and we started using the <unk> to the letters , and <unk> , and the <unk> of these things to be able to do these again , to <unk> those again , to <unk> .
and part of the design is to make pieces of these tools , and the other ones are going to have to have to have a little smaller in the building to build smaller extra cells .
and in every step , we have these pieces in the process that we could build it , because we tried to create a very robust process of what you &apos;re going to be able to see in a minute .
and after a very short period , it had all the characteristics of the species , and completely completely <unk> into a new world based on the new software that we have .
we have now , from our discoveries from all the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the <unk> of the future .
you know , i &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects that i &apos;ve been talking about about the human genome and what it could mean and the discovery of new groups of genes .
we find all kinds of species here that we have a second chromosome , or a third of the <unk> , each one of thousands of different countries in a second species .
and the exciting period came when we took this piece of <unk> chemical chemical and into a bacterium , and the bacteria started to read the genetic code and made a viral .
and i also found that we could be able to create a new form of explosion of the sunlight that we could have , in the new design of new design that could be built in this digital design .
it was in the cell cell and realized the other chromosome was different as a different material , and we had a cell with a new chromosome .
we &apos;ve been discovered for 20 years , and when we &apos;ve been the <unk> genome , the way we &apos;ve got the world &apos;s concepts , the world &apos;s biology in the digital world .
we have the <unk> of the <unk> and third generation of the relatively quickly , will be much higher than <unk> , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
we explore whether we can use <unk> co2 , which simply could be <unk> , <unk> that will be <unk> the co2 in the fuel .
because the truth is that if you break the <unk> , so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have a freedom . they have paralysis paralysis .
but our ability to write the code has evolved very slowly , but we &apos;re still living , and our final point now is going to be a exponential curve .
we knew that we used to use the <unk> of the mechanism that we used to use in order to fix that pieces .
if we were to take it with a <unk> from 10 and without travel , it would be <unk> pages , just to put it on the genetic code .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think is that many biologists tried to understand and have it in different levels .
we &apos;ve just made the pieces of the air that we could just break them up with a way that we could put it out and put it back and back .
so , all the proteins changes the same thing -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve been looking for .
today , there are three people on this planet for the year ; it &apos;s within 40 years ; it &apos;s going to be four .
this is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> where we &apos;re working with , and you &apos;re actually working with new species of computer on the computer .
<unk> is going to make it better -- not just the poor -- because all of these big choices are <unk> .
finally , you know , you &apos;re going to take this cartoon , and you know this cartoon , and , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
now , do we try to ask whether we can live , or can we create new life , or can we make new universe ?
these are over <unk> letters of code ; it &apos;s the greatest molecule with <unk> structure that has ever made by humans .
so we think that this is a situation in the software , actually , in a biological system , can actually build its own .
design is the key , and when you start to start with digital information , this is the digital information , really , to be able to be this digital information .
and so , the letters of this letters -- these letters are about 20 amino amino , and there &apos;s a single capacity for each of these amino amino amino .
so people think of evolution as a gene gene has changed a way of being a lot of biology .
and it &apos;s just <unk> . we can go to <unk> <unk> , <unk> by chemicals , or <unk> , and so on .
it may be like <unk> , but we can do it by changing the <unk> , things like that , and it &apos;s quite dramatic .
you know , we don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be , we know exactly how to put our genetic code .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first generation of <unk> &apos;s fourth generation , and it &apos;s about 18 months .
within a very long time , we believe we could be able to solve the fundamental questions of life .
<unk> <unk> , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view , the fish that i know .
but the <unk> of a <unk> is a recipe for me , and i guess , is a recipe .
we found the most of the original , if we could have the original sequence , if we &apos;d never have been able to have the original sequence .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s a organism called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life can exist in space and move on the way to <unk> .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we tried to get the process to get .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion <unk> , and that &apos;s a hundred million times a day .
we &apos;ve managed to get a hundred genes of the 500 of the 500 or so that &apos;s where they are .
so we had to develop a new way of using these little pieces that we could put these little pieces and the mistakes .
obviously , it &apos;s a virus that &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
we have problems with food , with fresh water , medicine , fuel , for billions of people .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace this , it becomes a huge challenge .
this is almost to limited to limited security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
so i have a look at this , this is not a <unk> -- that &apos;s based on us , and that &apos;s based on us billion years .
we have technologies today because of this fast <unk> to what we call <unk> genetics .
so we have now the opportunity to build a large robot of the millions of music to make the day .
this was our first attempt to try and start with the digital information , the genome &apos;s largest .
we made small pieces of the , and we made a dna molecule , and a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters .
when we first started the genome , the <unk> was at a risk of a 10,000 of a 10,000 .
think about it , we have a <unk> code : a , g , g , g and t .
the chromosome in the cell has no ; the chromosomes we &apos;ve got to get together .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 co2 in the air that is in the atmosphere .
we &apos;re going to be in first line of the biological reality and the of our models .
if you keep the <unk> , so everything is possible , you get the happiness .
does it give the chemistry of this really large molecules to create that stuff has been done before ?
and it took some of the years before we did the first experiments of the before we did the first experiments .
the particles have become the cells of cells and then they went back and brought back to the japanese .
i recently talked to the oil industry , and they said they were this model .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , word .
it &apos;s a big molecule that we can actually see even with the <unk> .
the <unk> had a dozen components , and look at the diversity of this .
12 to 24 hours , it was <unk> , and it was like it was .
we are from growing up to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
he lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , almost <unk> .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to the rest of the components .
and so we started thinking about the question , can we turn a chromosome ?
in my context , i was born in the year .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different ways .
these organisms can be fully going to be fully nine , they can live in the vacuum .
in fact , nasa has shown that there are lots of them out there .
they &apos;ve seen recently that they &apos;ve seen a bad experiment .
it &apos;s in between the power of the use of hydrogen using hydrogen .
and if we can do that , we can take the chromosome ?
you see , the top field is that just apart apart .
well , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we take it ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in what we need .
a chromosome is so by just a piece of chemical material .
this is the publication we &apos;ve just finished .
there are the <unk> of the <unk> , which are actually actually dna .
it &apos;s blue because of the genes we had to pull out .
you know , there &apos;s no way in this <unk> . &quot;
our steps in the scale of life were exponentially .
you may have heard that we have <unk> .
some people were just being there , that it was not poetry .
we tried to get to the point of the <unk> .
this is not a <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> .
these are images about a six of six seconds .
so we &apos;re focus on the fourth generation .
this is a organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
they &apos;re increasing the paralysis and the ability to be .
we always have to ask questions about questions .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills the bacteria .
they laughed more than you do .
so , this looks like a <unk> .
we have thousands of organisms that can do .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge for nine .
we started working with 15 years ago .
and it turns out , it &apos;s very difficult to do .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
this is the <unk> of the evolution here .
economists call this a <unk> for a .
we have unique elements here .
sunlight and co2 are a way .
first we did have signed .
why should we do that ?
everybody needs a <unk> .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to leave my talk to a english language , &quot; <unk> <unk> , who was <unk> , &quot; he said , &quot; nothing is so much <unk> , his name was <unk> , which is , &quot; nothing is so dangerous to the human mind , as thinking that our scientific ideas are , there is no inherent in nature that we are not <unk> , and there &apos;s no new worlds in there . &quot;
while i was doing this for a year , i &apos;ve been looking at the past , and i &apos;ve tried to look at other societies to see if it &apos;s better better than <unk> , or how we can help , or how to help creative , with the emotional risks that are connected to creativity .
you know ? i think a person to allow you to make a person , like the <unk> , and the essence and the source of the line , creative , , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , is a little bit too much responsibility to make it a human mind , human mind .
but we don &apos;t even hear anybody &apos;s listening to something like this , because we &apos;ve been familiar with this kind of information , so we &apos;ve got this kind of <unk> and collective accepted , and that means creativity and suffering -- that art and somehow -- at the end of that , the end of the time , is the end of the time .
they believed that a genius of the game was made of the kind of <unk> , that was was literally in the walls of a screen -- about a <unk> , the <unk> -- about like <unk> , the artists and the artists would make the work , and the outcome would make the end of work .
and then the renaissance came out and everything changed . we had this big idea , and we had this big idea : let &apos;s put the human center in the center of the universe -- about all the gods and <unk> , and there &apos;s no room for the creatures to take the round of independence .
this was a marriage event that i &apos;ve written a book -- a musician called <unk> <unk> , <unk> , with the <unk> -- that , in fact , unlike all my previous books , from a number of years , and a big <unk> , was <unk> by the same time .
it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was going to be about 20 years ago , when i first wanted to be a teenager , i wanted to be a writer , and i was faced with the same kind of <unk> response .
and i know that for me -- very dangerous , i would be very dangerous , and i think , is a very , very dangerous path of the other , especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career , in my career .
don &apos;t you worry that you &apos;re going to take care of your life , and you &apos;re never going to get a difference in a <unk> of a <unk> dreams -- your mouth &apos;s full of the wonder , the <unk> of the limb ?
my dad , for example , was chemists , and i can &apos;t help in any situation for the years of years , he asked if he was going to be a chance to be a chemists .
it &apos;s a picture of the first ever taken the whole world , the entire way , and then it &apos;s a <unk> of the military &apos;s the to make a rain in the detector .
and it &apos;s probably probably that everything i &apos;m writing about now is about the world than the work is going to be the most important success of my last book , right ?
and there are certainly people in this audience who are really <unk> scientific scientific opinions about the idea of -- -- <unk> , people and <unk> and <unk> on their projects and apply them to work .
we are going to be this kind of reputation , but not only the writers , but the creative of all <unk> , seem to have this reputation to be incredibly unstable .
i have to think of a way of being a a moment , a little distance from the rest of me and my very natural <unk> about how the reaction is going to be the whole thing .
a process that has to -- like everybody knows who has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , everyone here -- is always going to be reasonable .
we &apos;re getting away from that , we &apos;re going to make a long time , we &apos;re just a chance to survive that we have a chance to survive , so you can do it . thank you very much .
so it &apos;s now , and for all those of those who didn &apos;t have there , the sun is the greatest scientific experiment that has ever been done -- 27 miles in diameter .
the mission is to create the conditions that less than a second second , for the beginning of the universe , and it &apos;s about 600 million times within a second .
all you have to do is to look at the <unk> of really great <unk> from the 20th century , the young and often often die of by 21 times .
they &apos;ve seen this year with flu flu , we &apos;ve got a year back back and have a dollar , if it &apos;s in the right .
we &apos;ll get it down , and we &apos;re going to get to the data at june or july , and our journey , to figure out what the tiles are .
now , of course , in a way , the way that the way that crashes is to the debate is the value of science and <unk> in such a boundaries . it &apos;s easy to be .
because it &apos;s just as much sense of anything else that i heard about when it &apos;s about taking the absolute idea of creative process .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to do that , the fact that we move beyond our borders , the value of things like the sun .
and what is the very creative thing about the creative believed that you make us to do it in a way that it doesn &apos;t do other jobs ?
this is a -- there &apos;s a lot of the distance that i talked about -- the psychological people who are protecting you from the follow of your work .
have you not afraid that you have to take their entire life and never create a book , and you never have a book that &apos;s in the world ?
it &apos;s like the future might be able to look at changes today , the <unk> today , is now the <unk> of the bacteria , and <unk> , and potentially <unk> .
so , these are the kind of thought that you can get to get the person at the morning to drink the morning , and i don &apos;t want to do it .
they thought creativity was a kind of a <unk> , from a distant , unknown source of people -- from <unk> , unknown , unknown .
if you had to work from your work , you didn &apos;t want everything to go for you , and everyone knew that this <unk> genius was that you helped you .
but the second thing is , i think , is a little bit of my life and my career that i was trying to do to make my work completely .
is it that that of somebody should be expected to do that , do the work of it to do the work in the front of the time .
i &apos;m saying it &apos;s because we &apos;re all here , because we &apos;re all kind of a friends -- it &apos;s highly likely that my greatest success is behind me .
in other words , when we saw this image at the 10 , we knew that the machine works , which is a great deal .
now , this is all true , if you imagine that the magnet is over 20 pounds , and it &apos;s about 30 to each other .
i don &apos;t know if this was the biggest <unk> boat , or this one , when someone walked the google side and the front page .
and after a while , i &apos;m going to write that to me to write that i can write , to write some kind of <unk> psychological psychological psychological .
for the first time in history , people are going to be able to hear these or these artists , and they &apos;re a genius -- instead of being a genius .
now , the engineers , you &apos;re looking at them and say , &quot; no , you don &apos;t . this is little wires . &quot;
so , for example , they &apos;re very worried about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you get this success ?
so , about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had been doing this with these big wires -- these golden wires here .
eve <unk> said shortly before his last interview , in his last interview , <unk> me a little bit further .
do you think of that ? because with only one inch , i feel like i &apos;m not going to think about this with this really .
but to fair fair -- the group of the chemists have been given over the centuries of the centuries of <unk> people .
from the first is known to know that he had a <unk> he had a <unk> , he would take a lot of them to go away .
this is what i &apos;m doing . he &apos;s called the largest detector in the dark , three feet in the diameter .
it &apos;s the beginning of the rational , and people started to believe that creativity was completely entirely by their own individual .
so at close degrees , as a small , as the space is the space , can be able to make these wires .
the one thing is i &apos;m not going to be , i &apos;m going to get treated as i &apos;m going to be a bit of the time .
the question i want to ask you today is this : is this idea of it in order to do all right ?
the artist &apos;s artist was a certain of certain things , like , like , for example , too much , right ?
and even those who were not actually <unk> <unk> , seemed to be really really the best of their favorite .
and i think you &apos;re dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how to go back next century .
but in the old , , people didn &apos;t believe people were suffering , that creativity of people , is , okay ?
you can afford to because if you &apos;re very far , you will be <unk> .
but when it &apos;s writing about this , i think , about a lot of time , and i think , why ?
that &apos;s what -- i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
the guys had the same idea , called this kind of <unk> powerful creative mind , a <unk> genius .
this is great . the didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a genius of a particularly smart individual .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- it &apos;s the question .
maybe we can &apos;t just take the <unk> from 500 years of life , because we can &apos;t just get in a <unk> &apos;s screen .
but we &apos;re working on the same way that we &apos;re working on the same kind of development .
in one of the connections between the <unk> , the <unk> , it was a <unk> .
the standard and all of the entire ego and it &apos;s all that there are all those of those <unk> expectations .
so , maybe a profound understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of creative .
i think that &apos;s what you can do by using <unk> vaccines in the way that you have to do .
and i went back to come back to explain how the machine works .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions : <unk> , .
so here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the house in the construction to see the scale .
books books is my job , but it &apos;s of course more than that .
people said , don &apos;t you have to be succeed , you know , no succeed .
and i &apos;m afraid of a lot more stuff that nobody would be able to get .
i think that this <unk> has been given our artists for the last 500 years .
so this is the wires and <unk> <unk> , suddenly suddenly <unk> resistance .
i think it &apos;s better if we &apos;re having to live our big creative minds .
i have to tell you , i think it was a great mistake .
on the last september , the machine was running to the first time .
it means we &apos;re going to have a cultural impact besides the scientific .
did you not fear that you &apos;re going to a <unk> ?
so with your <unk> , john -- how do you get this ?
please follow me , because the circle will close .
so people in the west really had a long time of creativity .
i &apos;m not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to be in is : why not ?
on the last ted conference , i was a whole conference for the fly .
these wires <unk> <unk> when the machine is running on the <unk> .
and i &apos;m not going to do that .
a extraordinary statement that you can do about your life .
i would rather continue to do that .
and this quest led me to old old and old rome .
the greek named this by creativity <unk> <unk> <unk> .
if your work is not entirely your mistakes , or not your mistakes , right ?
it &apos;s like to give people to the sun .
it &apos;s also my great , life love and his .
and everybody knew that it was so , right ?
in fact , sometimes it can be <unk> .
and then they had to figure out what we did .
you &apos;re all coming back to your way .
by the end , the wheel will be more more .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all of these things .
i &apos;ve got some other 40 years in mine .
we take pictures of these <unk> in detectors .
it just came out , you know ?
oh , jesus , what a thought .
everybody knew their genius was a little bit .
this is the machine of sound .
and this picture was taken by the house .
we started <unk> them , <unk> .
like algae -- and other things .
it &apos;s just breathtaking .
it &apos;s caused by the <unk> .
so we &apos;re starting to take a decade of 50 .
okay , that &apos;s really cool .
that &apos;s how you know .
so the question is : how ?
seriously , the hard thing .
and i had always had .
why not be that thinking ?
this was the result .
i find them .
can we change it ?
i &apos;m writer .
is it essential ?
thank you .
maybe not .
i had a kind of encounter when i met the extraordinary american <unk> , who was now about 90 years old , but she told me that she was a <unk> , she told me that she was in the <unk> virginia , and she was up to the fields , and she said she would feel like a poem on the site on her landscape .
this idea that i was in the middle of the middle of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , i was able to do this in one of the big of the design of the we all fall in , and we don &apos;t work in it . you &apos;re not working on it . you think it &apos;s a disaster .
in other old paint , she ran out very long enough . and ran off , but she ran , and ran out the poem , and they ran through the house , and she would take it over land , and she said , &quot; well , she would go on to a different poet , &quot; and she &apos;s going to be a different poet .
she ran as the devils of the house while they were being passed from this poem , and it was just a piece of paper to a piece of paper and a pen to make it when they were through through it , and it was able to do it by the sheet of the paper .
so , she &apos;s leaving the house and looking for the paper , and the poem goes through and she &apos;s a pencil as they walk through them , and she said -- she said -- it was like the one to her other hand and grab it to the battle .
he went to high speed at the speed of a wonderful hear , which is a little bit of a wonderful hear , which is it &apos;s often hard to be a little bit of his talk , and he wants to have it . it &apos;s <unk> .
but the process and the heavy <unk> that he was <unk> , he was the genius from where he was doing a lot of trouble than anger , and he went to <unk> where he came from . he realized that it was not a <unk> , <unk> thing .
interesting historic : when the <unk> <unk> , they brought this practice with this , and the continued changed the way of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , that you &apos;re still listening to <unk> and <unk> .
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of his life was tom the embodiment of his life , he was trying to <unk> these <unk> creative stones , and to make these <unk> creative creative , who went to me and with them .
so i started thinking about it , and i think , with security , i was working on the book , which is soon being more difficult -- as the dangerous , , is a lot of success , so that &apos;s a success of my <unk> success .
this is a problem because the warming is the inherent in the world , the ocean ocean , which is huge amounts of carbon carbon , which is where it &apos;s going to be <unk> by microbes .
but , the tricky thing about the next morning , and you see that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock in a square -- and he &apos;s no longer a <unk> of god in a square .
it was the time that the time was going to be through a kind of a kind of a <unk> , and he did not do anything else before he had ever done before -- 1,000 nights before it was .
if a little bit in spain has something called a little bit , a little bit , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , great , great , great , it &apos;s : a <unk> look at god .
last year i showed these two slides to illustrate that , that the arctic &apos;s <unk> , which was that the size of three million years of the united states had been the size of the united states .
because ... end , it &apos;s like , &quot; centuries . &apos; &quot; in centuries , people have <unk> with <unk> <unk> , with saint bottles and music that have been spent hours of the way .
if you think that you &apos;re a <unk> -- from a <unk> source of a <unk> time , you &apos;re going to be able to be a different <unk> of your life , when you &apos;re ready to do it .
if the dumb thing is , you know , the dumb thing that you &apos;re asked to do is to give a brief moment of wonder , a brief moment of wonder , your effort to be <unk> .
i talked to him , <unk> , you know , you know , and i think you know , when this book isn &apos;t brilliant , it &apos;s not my responsibility , right ?
look at the area of the eastern pacific continent , the american continent of all the indian continent and <unk> the indian <unk> , where there are a <unk> of the lights in the ocean .
but then he got older and he was told that he told me that he was one day on a building in los angeles , and there was changed everything .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen a lot of this kind of performance .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so much as much as you didn &apos;t think of the beginning of the first , that the evidence of the rest of you have to be .
she knew that she could only do one of those things , and that was -- in her words , <unk> my favorite way -- <unk> my favorite .
for me , the best living example of how you can do this , the musicians have tom tom <unk> . i was able to play him a few years ago .
so he starts to be able to get this old <unk> in his mind , like i &apos;m going to lose this thing and will be going to be by this by this song .
it could have a <unk> , <unk> , bizarre , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , <unk> , that was quite pretty tom .
and then there were these moments -- the part i never forget -- she said , &quot; well , there &apos;s a huge amount of people in it .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for for you , just for you to make the shorter human love and the <unk> to be there .
i &apos;m a <unk> . i &apos;m going to work with a day at the same time , and i &apos;m going to end up and get the same time , and i &apos;m going to go back and get <unk> .
and maybe never will be told all of god &apos;s name , if he turns out , but what do he do with the rest of his life ?
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 co2 in co2 , all 24 hours -- 25 million tons of every day in the oceans .
and how do we deal with our minds without talking about our minds , but in fact , we &apos;re going to be in the contrary to our own health ?
and as i heard this story , it was a little bit like i did , and i &apos;ve been doing it once .
you see it grows , it &apos;s going to be the same thing ; this is the equivalent of the ice in the winter , and it &apos;s in the summer .
compared to the entire amount of <unk> in the atmosphere , it might be able to double this amount of energy , when we think about this critical dot .
they put the hands together , and they started sing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god , god .
the largest individual factor for global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels .
and this continued to the poem and the <unk> on the paper -- but backwards -- from the last word for the first .
he just looked in the sky and said , <unk> , can you see , can you see me ?
she was a nice poem on his tail , and it turned back in her body and so on on the paper .
and when i was thinking , i thought , i was really <unk> -- this is just like my creative process .
even i had work or ideas that i &apos;m from a source of a <unk> that i really can &apos;t identify .
because you see , i &apos;m all of what i &apos;ve done , i don &apos;t have more than that .
but this doesn &apos;t really reflect enough to the scale of this particular problem , because it &apos;s not the thick of the ice .
that so-called <unk> , five years old , or older , almost blood , is almost like blood , which is out of the body .
if you really want to be , come up with a moment of time , if i can take care of you .
it &apos;s only a <unk> <unk> , and maybe it &apos;s a <unk> , and maybe it &apos;s never going to go back to this particular level .
the next slide i &apos;m going to show you is a <unk> , which is what happened in the last 25 years .
professor <unk> <unk> at the university of west , a another <unk> north lake in the winter of the winter .
in the front , the <unk> <unk> , you see , new lakes , which were black , which were a few years ago .
but then i remembered how tom in the cover sky , and i tried to try .
and i want to give you to advice that i was here for my own , and i was here .
when something happened in the time , people knew what it was . they called it in his name .
what i need to say is that if i &apos;m going to crazy it , it &apos;s not a fear .
she felt if it was because it would bring the earth under your feet .
so i took my view of the river and i talked to my comment in a empty corner of the space .
so if you want to have better , you have to get here and your percentage of value .
all right . but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , the hell is going to be .
but then , and very rarely , very rare , something special , one of the most important was actually <unk> .
and the birds all over the world are actually in a really <unk> and never before we have never been the space .
it was taken by the inside of the and so forth , and it &apos;s <unk> through a <unk> fire .
and the <unk> that &apos;s been told about a few of these things , is particularly strong in the moon .
if you know how to go down the sea , you can see the sea sea through <unk> <unk> .
he has no one piece of paper ; he has no pen , he has no <unk> .
not the work of themselves . that was continued as much as <unk> and the .
these were always great , because the dancers were being , and they were fantastic .
already today , in a black lakes in central africa , in the <unk> of the water .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest <unk> on the planet .
40 percent of all people in the world are going to be half their own <unk> .
if you look at this in the historic context , you can see what it is .
it &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
you &apos;re good . the question is , how is it going to be us .
last month , researchers , the entire continent continent has a negative <unk> .
still , to your local , whatever he &apos;s going to be .
i think i feel like i was doing this , we should teach the .
in a sense , the arctic <unk> is the <unk> of the global heart of our global global <unk> .
and one reason is , this vast complicated <unk> is made out of the north .
these <unk> in the world leads a huge increase rate .
the united states is one of the two largest <unk> , combined with china .
and i guess that many of you have done this .
i &apos;m looking at the same thing that i could do a song ?
in california , a 40 percent increase in california has seen in the city .
and the predictions , as you read it , is serious .
four so many years in the last 30 years , as a result of the age of war .
oil is a problem , and coal is the worst problem .
but even in my <unk> , i sometimes have this thing .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
but instead of getting panic , she &apos;d just stopped .
i started thinking , i should just put the project .
i &apos;m still going to write on , because that &apos;s my job .
when we start thinking , it &apos;s all about this .
in the years , it &apos;s going to be gone here .
in the &apos; 60s , the <unk> is the <unk> for this city .
but if you &apos;re <unk> , it &apos;s also going to be the only water <unk> .
she said it would be like a <unk> train .
he went through the whole set of and did something completely .
and suddenly , he didn &apos;t even have more than a longer .
and the standard line was to build many more <unk> .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
and that &apos;s great because we need to do that .
this is one of the most <unk> of a creative life .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you to all of the future .
but the volume are more bigger than ever before .
this is 20 feet of <unk> , like greenland .
the land on them would be <unk> .
if your job is dancing , you can get home .
and if you don &apos;t , dance , your dance .
it grows in the winter and in the summer .
this is the <unk> river in the greenland .
if you don &apos;t , somebody else &apos;s today .
his whole life has changed .
what about a thing ?
go and <unk> <unk> . <unk> .
that &apos;s god , do you know ?
the <unk> is with red .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
these are the clouds getting rapidly .
the <unk> have been .
just do it .
this is the <unk> .
that &apos;s hard .
not is not a .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
wow !
as a computer , i was <unk> by the way of the kind of interaction , with the objects of our interaction with the real objects -- and my colleagues , which is , if we could use the computer , the instead of a <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> on a flat <unk> -- ... what if we were able to do both hands and physical , and we could do it like that ?
i study molecular biology and i &apos;ve been doing now for a couple of years ago , and i started to know , because i just wanted to know what i was doing , and it &apos;s also what i learned in studying the study of what i &apos;ve learned in studying education .
the idea i want to show you with you is that we &apos;re going to be at the threshold of this new generation of <unk> with interaction with the digital media that information is going to bring information into our electricity .
the last example i have today is to show you today , is a <unk> <unk> for that we &apos;ve recently developed and in the <unk> as sound , like <unk> , and i &apos;m going to do it with a little bit like this .
and if these tools are <unk> , and a conscious sense of their movements are able to recognize each other and the the of our <unk> with them , we can begin to start with the exploration of new new and discovery .
one of the interactions of the interactions that we were looking at is that we could share gestures based on data , how to do it , like to see how to do it with little bit of the same way .
as you realized how to take the hands of the hands , and the <unk> , the <unk> and moves , actually , you actually learned to solve and solve problems and solve the way that you can solve .
this is a <unk> for the <unk> and , and when i put it in a direction , the video will be able to break it ; if i go back to the other direction , it &apos;s backwards .
there are also some of the other things that are also in education , like languages , math or <unk> , where we give people the opportunity to give the point of the fast and see the results .
in this case , we have three <unk> of our <unk> as a <unk> , and i can use them to put color in the middle of the center where they &apos;re going to be cut .
i think the molecular molecular model now is , so that &apos;s what you &apos;re talking about , and it &apos;s all sorts of things that you &apos;re doing to do , and we have biology and so on .
and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a <unk> dollar last last year , to keep up clean coal , which is a contradiction .
so we &apos;ve got to put a <unk> on the top , a <unk> <unk> , to bring a <unk> on the way to get the truth about coal .
we begin to do the <unk> in two <unk> and put it in a set of spots , and it &apos;s kind of a little bit more of the voice .
so as you can see , my uncle is in developing new kinds of new design that are better to the way our brains and bodies are working .
and yet , the burning of the main data is the global warming , the remarkable strong <unk> that you see here , changes everything .
you can move with your hand , you can see each other &apos;s brain , and you can put their movements and you have a screen .
these are some of the kids who came to the media lab , and i was able to move them to try and do it , and i got a video of it .
basically , you get to each other every day , every <unk> of random letters , and you &apos;re trying to create words , and you &apos;re trying to do words , you know , that &apos;s a dictionary .
and i had time to give you some of these new <unk> and some of the ways that we &apos;re working on in our lab .
let me tell you a very clear thing , al gore , politicians , <unk> <unk> , who are talking to what they &apos;re talking about .
a plan to bring america to the job , to help us do the global warming .
more importantly , are physically , so you can &apos;t move them to be able to get out of the <unk> of the hands of the hands .
the red set of that is all the together , our dependence on <unk> <unk> is like <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
he can make new characters in the scene by looking at the <unk> by the table of the table that is a little bit of the character .
here are the ones that have been in the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
one of the great ways that we have , our dependence from old , the european fuels , to reduce the world .
i &apos;d like to start with you , at the time of childhood , when you were playing with <unk> .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , again , and you have a new new way of trying to try and create new possibilities .
so a interesting thing about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t need to give people to people .
everything that you have to say is &quot; hey , &quot; and you know what to do .
i &apos;ve got to take a little bit of a little bit , and it &apos;s a very <unk> process to the modern molecular biology .
it &apos;s extremely important , now , extremely important , and it &apos;s a lot , much more important to be in the future .
but now there &apos;s a brave , new solution to us to free ourselves from this <unk> .
and you can put those sounds into the sequence of the sequence that you can put in a pattern .
i can do the whole sequence of the whole speed of time , and i &apos;m going to go through the same way .
and i don &apos;t have to do it in the car , but i can &apos;t get you on the same time , and you &apos;re going to go .
around the course of the day , i have walked home to me in tennessee , a billion tons of <unk> .
there &apos;s it in the skin and in the <unk> , and it &apos;s helping our economy .
this question was that we had to continue to be the answer that we decided to have the answer and the answer .
and then effects are even more effects and the grid that you &apos;re looking at the entire sequence .
and now i &apos;m going to use the filter with the field of life , i can drive the effect of life .
finally , the positive alternative is the positive alternative to our economic challenge and challenge our challenge .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be able to get quickly , you go alone .
here &apos;s a number of times that i &apos;m going to do with a simple <unk> .
this is a game with words , which is a combination of a combination of <unk> and <unk> .
it &apos;s a story with the end , and it can decide how to evolve .
and then i can go through the whole sequence of the whole , i &apos;m going to put the full sequence on the left .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to kind of get closer to the matter , like this .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the economy , the climate .
the spatial thing is that we &apos;re understanding how we understand a lot of our environment .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> to the cameras of the digital digital data .
if you &apos;re surrounded by the way you &apos;re going to notice that you can get nervous .
by holding the <unk> shake , and she can pick up the side of it .
and you just take it by just a <unk> , you can keep a <unk> <unk> .
there &apos;s effects that you can live live in live , like silicon and filter .
and now i &apos;m going to go back to the filter with the council of something more expression .
look at this , this is the today , clean <unk> .
finally , a solution , the big enough to solve our problems .
so , in short , a computer is a <unk> computer in the size of a <unk> .
each other has four different variations ; you can choose that one thing you want to use .
he &apos;s also <unk> and <unk> , and they stay in <unk> and bread .
when we see the climate , we see climate change , we &apos;re going to be a threat to our business .
<unk> america : 100 percent clean electricity in the next 10 years .
you can turn it up with a particular sound , and then you put it to the table .
so let &apos;s give a tour of this modern , <unk> .
the future is here . wind , sun , and a new system .
and it turned out that he wanted to be just pile of the <unk> .
so the opened for the biggest successful of the .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s also a good thing .
<unk> america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
so if i put them on top of the time , that you &apos;re interested in .
this is in our entire country of the <unk> america .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
so , you don &apos;t worry about the climate .
if we can do it , we can get a little bit of a .
here are some people who are testing it .
there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
one of the commercials &apos;s commercials was in the car , was the one .
<unk> of the <unk> is a <unk> , ted .
the most powerful <unk> is the director of <unk> <unk> .
new investments to create good jobs for free jobs .
if you want to come , go to . &quot;
i &apos;m looking at the conversation with them .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
they saw it in the news .
<unk> , the <unk> is every day .
this is a , part of it .
<unk> coal , you &apos;ve got a lot of it .
but it &apos;s the sound of the <unk> .
<unk> america , they find more .
we have to come up and get it fast fast .
and these interactive portraits are taking each other .
and they &apos;re also comfortable their movements and tendency .
this is our primary <unk> there on the bottom of the road .
now he gets a little cylinder in the scene .
now i &apos;m going to do something about that .
i can make the sequence of them in the way .
i &apos;m forward to that i &apos;m there .
so , what is it going to be <unk> ?
in fact , coal is not necessarily .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
i &apos;m starting to start with some simple examples .
so they were just for him .
we wanted to develop a <unk> system for <unk> .
so , that was my primary effect .
this picture was remembered with me .
here he can make the sun .
now i &apos;m using a whole piece of stuff .
leave your quiet to us .
they really loved it .
this is a interactive <unk> .
... his own personal invent .
this was what happened to the screen .
this is the last .
good work ! yes !
so let &apos;s see .
yeah , good day .
that &apos;s more .
the sun is going to .
the orange river .
thank you .
thank you .
flying cat .
thank you .
thank you .
hi there .
and now , in the way , this is a lot of biology , and i think biology is actually a <unk> , because the code is an equal code , which is , it &apos;s not quite the same thing , because it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s just the same thing , because it &apos;s kind of matter , it &apos;s real matter , and it &apos;s not just <unk> .
so in the image , you see the lab , in <unk> , so that all of these things , with a <unk> garage , which has a <unk> in the <unk> , a group of paris , which is a group of which is happening and quite successful , and quite a interesting thing , and it &apos;s quite interesting , i want to do a project .
and they &apos;ve been so two two of these two two two of these and , and we have a lot of open , so we &apos;ve got to open it up and cheaper , and that &apos;s where the device is , and now that &apos;s now now , and now , the performance is now the infrastructure , and now the performance is the very performance of these devices .
a group of delegation that i &apos;ve met before a while , which is a <unk> that would like to convey the public , what they &apos;re learning in the university of college , and so on , and they &apos;ve tried to explain what &apos;s going on .
and problem , that &apos;s not just a problem , it can also be a technological problem , it can also be a <unk> , which is a <unk> , a <unk> , and how can you do it differently or how to do it better .
and then , from the <unk> <unk> website , and said , we have to do , and we &apos;ve also got to do this , really , real time , and then we have two events , a in london , and then a little bit , in the <unk> , in san francisco , and in the <unk> , in san francisco .
that &apos;s when you go a beam , you can go in a room , you can do little particles into the air or then you can move in the fluid and then in the fluid , so that &apos;s where a <unk> is basically a bit like a <unk> .
this is a more artistic force , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and working in collaboration with scientists , and with scientists , with these technologies and questions and the creative process , there are <unk> and , and all kinds of things .
the first project we did was as an international group , when we were ourselves , we have to be aware of ourselves as a real scene , and we are online , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people that always have and so .
this is what &apos;s going on in the academic academic lab , and we thought , well , we &apos;ve got to be able to go back , then we have a computer , the <unk> , the lens , the lens , the lens , you have a left , which is the least the one that goes on .
and that &apos;s really amazing because you actually believe that these <unk> <unk> , which is that the fact that you &apos;re actually in the future , but in fact , it &apos;s the fact that the future is right in us , in our <unk> roots .
and so o o <unk> with this premise with this idea of <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , then a <unk> , and then a <unk> , a <unk> and , and yes , so <unk> , and then then bacteria would have done a sudden , then bacteria would have a sudden .
i tried this in my lab , a little bit of a little bit of <unk> , and i was going to put on a <unk> and i was going to buy a little bit of a analysis , so that &apos;s what the <unk> <unk> was like , so that &apos;s what the <unk> of the <unk> .
and so , yeah , you see it &apos;s relatively relatively <unk> , so that there &apos;s a lot of people who are going to do their own home to the home , so that &apos;s a lot of organizations that even more and more in the <unk> form .
so , if i go to the mit , the mit &apos;s going to go , let &apos;s go through , collect any kind of , and then you do this , and then you can say , <unk> , this is what you &apos;re talking about , that &apos;s this one , that &apos;s what it &apos;s like to do .
but that &apos;s so my prototype , but pretty much pretty much looked at this , like this , the thing that was on , and it was just a <unk> , and it was just <unk> , and it was the pressure that was broken , the thing that was hot .
in fact , there are things that have been happening in the life , which is most likely , but not , for example , that we allow us to wash up with the degrees of the ocean , are also more <unk> <unk> .
i think that the media media in us , cognitive media models , which is that , in our biological memory , very long time , we have been able to have a long time , and that we can actually have that straight through interactive media .
and what you can do with it is , and also , you know , in terms of the society , you know , what you &apos;re doing is what you want to do , you have to do this , you have to do this with this way , you &apos;re going to be able to do this with you ?
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also design and you can also also be able to do , and i think i was incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to do a lot deeper with myself .
there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , which is originally related to switzerland , which is with europe and with a cooperation in india , but now we have a lot of people who have been known or active people around the world .
so , that &apos;s the moment that the <unk> is the scene of the scene , using this using technology and the information that is more people , and the <unk> , that more people can be there .
and it &apos;s got it , it &apos;s just just the software , but there &apos;s also a lot of the <unk> , there &apos;s a whole lot of <unk> things that make all kinds of things .
and he &apos;s so , he &apos;s a kind of a , like this <unk> , so that <unk> , or something , so he has <unk> with <unk> , his <unk> is sam <unk> .
because as the first thing , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have a relatively little bit of it , and i don &apos;t have a chance to do it .
here &apos;s the image on the front here , and it &apos;s a <unk> , so it &apos;s a <unk> , so it basically works a kind of school , a private school , where everyone can get .
kids , old , all of these things are going to go to just go around , just do you have a laboratory and look at what can be when you &apos;re doing , and you can see what these <unk> .
you know , what happens to a laboratory , which is kind of <unk> , which is kind of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , extremely expensive , very expensive , with a little , with a little , with a ph.d. and so on .
and we don &apos;t have it , but that &apos;s the case , but that &apos;s pretty good , i think , well , well , that &apos;s pretty good for that .
we all know that the interactive media are <unk> by definition of what the event of the world involves , and what of course , is that we &apos;re feeling the economics as normal .
and that &apos;s , that &apos;s very , very young people , but the only thing that &apos;s actually all the most is all the most potent , is this 600 of technology .
now , it &apos;s not that simple , but it &apos;s not impossible if you have enough curiosity and enough energy , you get too far from it , and you &apos;re too far .
you &apos;re going to put <unk> on <unk> and then put it on the <unk> , and then i put it on the line , and then you put it on the bottom of it .
and we hope that we &apos;re going to also look at it , and also , we can also be also also , and also , well , that &apos;s also more people .
the second thing is that we &apos;ve been able to use this <unk> of these <unk> models , and we &apos;re able to use it , very , very , very much time we use today .
that &apos;s a kind of very sad thing to do , because it &apos;s not true , because it &apos;s really what it &apos;s like , and what &apos;s actually behind .
another thing that &apos;s going to do with this u.s. , which is also to do that with this <unk> , is the <unk> , is the <unk> , the way that it &apos;s the <unk> , complicated .
but anyway , it &apos;s not yet , but it &apos;s still cheap , but it &apos;s certainly a place where it becomes a lot of time .
and if you want to make a difference in the world , you can make meaningful decisions in society and then you need to do the access to knowledge and to the technology .
and then , because it &apos;s also about , yeah , who are we , what do we want to say , what do we want to be ?
a project that i did with the <unk> was made of the person in switzerland , that we wanted to be a so-called optical optical or a biological plant .
then their measured measured measured , and the depending on what they thought or how they thought , are then different lights in space .
and the machines that make this kind of stuff that are pretty much of the ones that are running the ones that are going to make the car , do it for <unk> .
and it &apos;s about how to put people in interactive media , so they can use this interactive media and make them a bit more <unk> experience .
this is from the <unk> network , which is actually a kind of a forum where you have to stop and online and online online .
and then , on the networks that made the whole popular thing , it &apos;s got a scene that i &apos;d like to take you back to .
a <unk> , if you do the full power of water , the enough , so i think , so that it &apos;s so possible to do so far for the cash .
because if you read about it , it &apos;s not the same thing that &apos;s not the same thing as you &apos;ve made it or seen .
this is a question that &apos;m very interested in as a evil , but also in the area of the <unk> and everything in the field of all things .
computers know , computers and then it will always be like the same , and the hacker , the hacker , and it &apos;s a little bit of the same data .
the way in this artistic sense of biological materials and , and yes , also <unk> , and combine it in quite a kind of <unk> way .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because every every <unk> has been a little bit of technology , in fact , as most of the most , it &apos;s really like that .
and this is <unk> , which is also mentioned mentioned , this is , this is a sort of <unk> <unk> principle for biology .
it &apos;s pretty intuitive , so everybody just has its desires , his son , and that &apos;s what it moves , they &apos;re .
so it &apos;s about copy of genes , to develop , to develop , in order to do that , so that you can make it visible .
and i put up in the other image of the world , in a lecture , in the medical museum , in the middle of a show with a exhibition .
and we even tried to get into the academic world , but it &apos;s kind of not that kind of stuff .
and then we have a <unk> <unk> and then we put the <unk> <unk> , and then i tried to focus on this camera .
but it &apos;s always about to find a <unk> of a way that you have to have a little bit of a little bit of a deal with it .
there are a little bit of a kind of technical approach , and also a little bit of a little bit of the <unk> , and then you &apos;re asking , questions .
so , in any time , a material that has been <unk> , it &apos;s been on the way that you &apos;ve been talking to .
so , another project that comes from the french group was from paris , which is pretty cool .
and that &apos;s now a very very smart network of good , yes , <unk> , that are all around the world .
i &apos;m going to go to and go to the point that i &apos;m going to prove you to try and have a natural relationship with the potential .
so i think we &apos;re in the more of the world &apos;s more than the academic world .
he then got this blue there , and in the way , in the way , this is what it was like to do with the museum .
and then the <unk> , the <unk> , in the <unk> , with <unk> , and it &apos;s also the internet .
and that &apos;s not in the <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can be very cool .
so , it &apos;s a way of <unk> , like this kind of <unk> , which is about that far , two or two or something .
and so , in the interest of this technology , i &apos;m going to go on this technology , and i &apos;m going to go on and go .
on the left , a group of indonesia is a group of indonesia , <unk> , which is the , that &apos;s a lot of time .
there was a time in the room in the room , and it &apos;s on those chair , moving this blue .
to <unk> cognitive models , that &apos;s the models that we have in the most distant place .
and it &apos;s about , with a simple , creative , way , a problem .
you need to take biological materials , and you need to also tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
and so , you can get the particles up enough enough , and then you go into the ocean .
so , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to be able to get into the way that you &apos;re going to be able to do this with these scientific technologies .
there &apos;s now craig craig in the <unk> trying to make a <unk> , which is <unk> from algae .
and our approach was to say , well , we &apos;ve got to say that , you don &apos;t have to do this .
and the commercial device costs about <unk> , or something like that , <unk> , so that &apos;s the same thing as the 50 .
and you have to do it , and you can understand it and understand it .
these are the people who are at least <unk> , on the website , <unk> website .
that &apos;s me , there are fewer people than actually exist in fact , than there are no .
and <unk> , so the <unk> , because the <unk> in berlin was the first , <unk> .
and i would invite you to be able to get to and look at what &apos;s going on .
but always always the one that &apos;s going to be just simple and accessible .
and what are our values and what are our minds , what is our foundation , our foundation ?
so it &apos;s not the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically the case of the fact that it &apos;s actually .
there are so things like all the <unk> that we have to grow plants .
so , for a while , you know , to fly now , you need some material .
in this <unk> , we heard that we have a principle of greenhouse gases to the human .
and it didn &apos;t have , but we &apos;ve got a lot of things about it .
so this is just a application of many you can do .
one project that i was starting to build was a <unk> building .
it actually has really been <unk> , so that these networks are .
so the device you see , it &apos;s not working .
there &apos;s been a good code , i think , a very good code .
and i think technology is increasingly in our modern societies .
and then , the <unk> system , and the <unk> <unk> and science science .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re also in in northern africa .
and in part of these <unk> , these places have been there .
i just want four <unk> and i want to explain that i &apos;m going to explain .
most of the people know that most people know that the <unk> .
and then i took a <unk> , and i took that to it .
so i know some of the things that don &apos;t have .
and these are just the <unk> , the individual people .
and the third area that &apos;s actually about itself .
now , this is not supposed to be a joke , but it &apos;s not a joke .
so what do we do about this is that we &apos;re doing this ?
i think that &apos;s kind of like a nice dollar or something .
so , i think , a very <unk> quick story .
and that &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
that &apos;s a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and then there are <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
and then we &apos;ve got a <unk> .
like , i said , <unk> it .
and the list can continue to be able to do .
longer than these two networks .
and that &apos;s the very beginning .
what about the fact that we are actually making models ?
it was a pretty <unk> project .
so , what is the beginning of ?
that &apos;s what you see down there .
how are we actually working people ?
this was basically what was unusual .
thank you very much for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hello .
so , i &apos;d like to leave that with the my own talk , and that &apos;s what the characteristics of the ability to have , that the properties of the <unk> are going to be able to be <unk> , and that we have to be in this way , and we &apos;re in the way that technology , technological , new products , not in the future , but actually to us to come back to our
bruce brown , a famous <unk> at the <unk> , is that far as it was to book and the image , and the book , not the tv , the internet and so on , what we &apos;re doing as a media today , that these creatures have <unk> our memories , and our ability to have our ability to have a <unk> .
and before the background i &apos;ve been in the realm of such a design , so the next generation of the human computer in the mind with the human computer , so how our tools or how the computer &apos;s computer , or the computer system , the digital research .
so if you look at google <unk> for example , then a concept of what makes us virtual world with the world , that means our <unk> to the <unk> , the virtual virtual system , the virtual current , as a normal , is to be again .
and this sounds sound , and the one of the <unk> , the one of the region , and that , of course , could be able to be able to read that songs and put it on other things , and then you could go back to the left , and then back to the left , right ?
i &apos;m a training of home , so i &apos;m also like to do the topic of curiosity and how change the curiosity also turn us , and why we &apos;re going to be , we &apos;re also losing curiosity , and we need to do it again , and we &apos;re going to do it .
that means you &apos;ve found that you &apos;ve talked to a common language , you could communicate with each other , it &apos;s in the same cave , or in other areas , or in the city , or the city , or the city , and it &apos;s kind of like <unk> .
and so i &apos;m going to see the city of a very different , a very different sense , which is really negative and positive , and the sort of thing that &apos;s going to be a very different , virtual map of a very real city , a very real real city .
and i &apos;m just going to be one of these little devices , because things are always supposed to be , always natural , and all the natural ones are going to be , and there &apos;s a little bit of them , and it &apos;s really for us to be , of course , what &apos;s going on or the way that we &apos;re doing .
i &apos;ve got in the school and i hope that video works , a very , very nice project , that is the most beautiful of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
and if i say , &quot; well , you know , you &apos;re probably not in front of you , you know , people are doing a little bit of a <unk> , or that they &apos;re playing with the with some <unk> in the hand .
but for me , in the field of the interactive media , as a particularly impressive thing , we have to have a <unk> of our biological memory , the ability to think of the ability to think .
and this wealth of virtual reality is to the reality that people have been in the most difficult time , and they were not , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
and as you can see , it &apos;s a very <unk> area , and you had to move there , from the island to the island to the food .
that is , instead of remember , instead of being , we have a lot of common , in mass systems , in the common areas of information , which we can keep our personal memories .
so this is how i think of this in my talk , of course , because we &apos;re not moving in , in the way that we &apos;re not going to be able to work in the virtual worlds , the way that we &apos;re .
now , you &apos;re going to ask why , why do the whole structure of the whole structure of communication , <unk> , and the interaction of communication , and so on .
so if we look at the evolution of our society , we &apos;re going to look at the third , we &apos;re moving from the third to the fourth or <unk> .
this means for a kid that has been done to the one of the most powerful time of the most of his life with the <unk> of stories .
and that &apos;s what this happened is that we have the responsibility for our memories and our individual memories , have been in external media .
and we &apos;re going to focus on the <unk> for the virtual reality in our <unk> , and we can actually do this , actually , that we can actually do this .
author of the book &apos;s <unk> <unk> , jonathan &apos;t <unk> , <unk> , we still have a year of stories every day .
we don &apos;t put the thing in images in the images that things are not in images , but we put it in the language .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do with a city , which is what i &apos;m going to be positive by looking at what places were being positive .
you go through this house in your house , in <unk> , and look at a lot of doors .
you had to learn , you know , not an idea of nature , but we &apos;re learning it and we &apos;re learning it and we &apos;re learning .
now we think of our love is to be the good thing that we have a child on the lap .
and this game is the virtual world , so the data that data is the <unk> , we &apos;re making , with the real world .
oh , what you can see here , sorry , is a little bit of what you see .
we will not get them to immediately to answer it , but it &apos;s going to happen to happen , and it &apos;s right now .
in this head , knowledge and <unk> , this virtual images , the imagination , was able to get the same , already , has been passed .
maybe you can get up with the moment of time , so you can start to get the same thing with the two .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening to the outside , i think , is that i &apos;m going to make the real world .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s too much in us that we can deal with .
and what the interesting thing is that the raw and the sequence of regions could be done by songs .
i &apos;ve been asked to have asked if this was a <unk> shop , and my instead will be speaking .
you may know that you may be a little bit of the the fact that you &apos;re going to be a little bit of the substance of the u.s.
and we have the urge as law , and there &apos;s still one thing that &apos;s going to be more like the <unk> .
we had the <unk> system , we had this , and we got this up , and we put this as a result of this .
but these concepts , the <unk> that we bring out of these opportunities to be able to rediscover these opportunities again .
and this project , i was going to give you an example of how to do this , cognitive models .
this is a whole set of things that you &apos;re looking at next to the actual war as a <unk> .
so , now , with the shock of the world , it &apos;s actually the most powerful thing in the world .
<unk> , priest , the <unk> , were able to get some knowledge in the way that they were in to preserve knowledge .
and all of a sudden , a lot of people have gotten to look at the whole thing , and it &apos;s not a lot of reality .
and these are over the centuries of the centuries , and more than the <unk> of the <unk> .
the interesting thing about this is that at this time , at the same time , at the same time , the human being was <unk> .
all that needs to be the ability to accept our basic ability to make a true habitat .
they don &apos;t have any <unk> , but they have used the way that they use <unk> or they use the same thing .
why are we not sing to come from a point of b to come from a b ?
now , this is the result of and it &apos;s the book , and it &apos;s the <unk> .
it sounds very <unk> , and sounds very , very embarrassed , i know .
you can &apos;t explain that much more than you can do , there &apos;s more lot more behind it .
the fourth thing is that the story is the place for us to be a place of the .
it &apos;s about a matter of it , it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
there are technical concepts like the <unk> industry , which means that the extended reality is the extended reality .
yes , children are from nature to be curious or should be curious , designers .
if you &apos;re going to be curious , you &apos;re going to get it in the n .
of course , this virtual world is in the middle of our cities , right now .
but the language of the was the language , something very natural , something very much .
this was the <unk> through the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
the interesting thing about this is when i can make a little trip .
we &apos;re still the <unk> of the <unk> , very , very strong .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve had in the last half year .
so i started with , when i was , of course , or what was going on .
and today , we &apos;re still very , very strong at stories .
it &apos;s going to go back to the cultures of the arts .
i gave them an example of the heart of the heart of the inner .
what has our thinking of our thinking and our minds ?
and with a kind of a , we can make these virtual worlds .
yeah , i &apos;m very interested in your hands .
you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change for a change .
so , unfortunately , we were really <unk> of god &apos;s <unk> .
and other example , the most example , the most complex systems .
these are rooms that can make intelligent people to find .
what &apos;s going on , of course , is extremely <unk> , and it &apos;s a computer .
but i &apos;ve been doing it just a bit more interesting .
how many first doors have the house in which you live ?
the only thing that had been her head was .
and the lives of living in the <unk> of british columbia .
that is , you know , you &apos;re <unk> about sounds and about <unk> .
we used to be used to things that happen .
the whole one is a game , i have to say to you .
i &apos;m sure i need to be very powerful .
i &apos;m also going to be able to get the same thing .
it &apos;s the reality and it &apos;s not without computers .
and that was the head of the mind .
and the main idea of the <unk> has been been since stories .
and they did this with this called <unk> .
and the language of the language were <unk> .
we &apos;ve been in the way that we &apos;ve been in the <unk> .
another example is the virtual reality .
anyway , you can do that .
and we &apos;re going to look at this .
and that &apos;s what they do .
if you go to a little bit of this , you &apos;ll think .
but i &apos;m going to be able to speak right now .
then the <unk> of the most successful cultures .
what we &apos;re doing is the <unk> .
i want to explain a little bit of one .
and the two <unk> are here today .
a <unk> for the most popular example of interface .
i want to show you that .
this is what &apos;s happening to this .
and the book , and the picture .
we have a abstract language language .
the question is , what is now coming ?
maybe again , you have to look at a view .
so , from the modern space .
every society is shaped by a <unk> .
at the beginning of the <unk> , the language .
or they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
no , no , far .
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s happening ?
this is a game for out .
they didn &apos;t have books .
let &apos;s do a little bit of a little .
from the <unk> to the end .
we &apos;re not producing more ourselves .
that &apos;s not going to be .
they didn &apos;t have a media .
yes , that &apos;s .
what are media today ?
they have similar principles .
why does this happen ?
fantastic , right ?
thank you .
and if you look at the software that we &apos;ve seen , you will also understand why <unk> is about our own software , not to be a little bit of <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> of many areas or <unk> , or even though it &apos;s already a meaningful sense of how classic software is about
and you see , you know , you have a lot of seven senses , which is most of us think we &apos;ve only got five , , and it &apos;s certainly seven , and there &apos;s the next time , the next , the sense , and it &apos;s even again .
and if i have a <unk> , then , we see no longer one another , and we &apos;re not going to see a unit , and that &apos;s what circle , and we see one unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a circle , another one .
with the total transparency , what the new thinking is , don &apos;t tell you that in the old , <unk> , and not a more <unk> , or other phenomena , is , i &apos;m just trying to do this , and i want to do this , and i want to do that in the front
then the next one that you &apos;ve done is the <unk> model model , or mental model of software , worked on the way that you have an idea of something , metaphor , metaphor , metaphor for the metaphor of a computer to make the computer .
before the background i &apos;ve been busy busy , what it says , what is it , what is it that we might have , what is the <unk> , what is the difference for us , so what makes the difference ?
we see this in when i do things , i can &apos;t , you can look at it like the right side , where i don &apos;t know what , what is salt and sex , or i can make them sort of intuitive intuitive , i &apos;m showing things like that .
and then , again , it &apos;s going to go back to the front of the front , and you &apos;re going to be now right now , please come back and get you to see what you see , and that &apos;s what you want to see .
that was a <unk> , because of course , because you were the way you started into the <unk> , in the form of <unk> , which is what , and alive , i started to turn it into , and i &apos;m going to do it in stone , and i &apos;m also going to do it
and when , of course , as a result , as a result , as a as a code , i can take it on the way , and it &apos;s just the things that you &apos;re going to make a <unk> , so you &apos;re just making fun , because they &apos;re fun and they &apos;re just
but i have to understand at the heart , in the context , when information is information information , when information comes information information , and information information , i know how to do things , or , of course , i can do things like that , or of course , to do it .
back then , it was as a <unk> , where i was , and other people said , &quot; are you actually going to be <unk> , if the people start to read , and then they want to be able to read , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be <unk> .
the right-hand circle is the little bit than the small , although it &apos;s not the case , but it &apos;s very big , and yet our perception , the depending on the other , we &apos;re changing things .
if i know that , i &apos;ll take a little bit of seconds , until i &apos;m sort of <unk> the present into the <unk> , then i can also do very well with him , and i &apos;m also going to do a lot of my three seconds .
and now we &apos;re going to come into the next generation and the exciting thing , so that &apos;s just a few hundred years , and we &apos;re really right now in this <unk> phase , that we &apos;re really in this this <unk> phase .
that &apos;s what i mean , now , i &apos;m actually able to see a lot of the <unk> , but i &apos;ve got them to see them in a very large time , and i have to see them in the same time in the picture of this picture .
there are also also <unk> , why one of the things that you have to do is to be a little bit , where does it cost to be like , not so much money , so it &apos;s not so much ?
if we go back to the software of software , this is the first <unk> line , which is very abstract , which is very abstract , where you &apos;ve got months to do with these systems .
that means that , if you know , the way you know , it &apos;s watching you , you know , who &apos;s looking at the long , because i don &apos;t have any <unk> for what &apos;s going on .
that doesn &apos;t mean they probably go home four hours to go home , but you can &apos;t do it , and you can &apos;t do it with four hours of it .
you have to imagine that you have to do something like that , five hours , and five hours , you need to take a long way of natural software , and it &apos;s an hour .
the real exciting thing is , when you take this , this new society , this new society , and very many mechanisms of the <unk> , and the <unk> emerged from the out of the <unk> .
so in the village , the village knew who were what was looking at and when , as this is , this is what this is happening to these days of our self through this <unk> of our own .
so you have to deal with what it means , and it &apos;s not just changing it , it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s going to be better .
so , very exciting processes , which is that , in this , yes , gray is not actually , but here in this <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of times in the very <unk> .
<unk> means , however , how can i get a certain goal , or how a users can do a certain goal , and how a users do it , and a <unk> , and a goal .
that means that the local village has become a global village with the same principles , of course , is , , of course , is the total transparency .
this is , we &apos;re just going to see our <unk> before we see it , that again , back to back in our back , to say , okay , okay .
and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do , and you look at the and you see , okay , okay , now i &apos;m just going to go into the inner itself .
and as we look things , what we &apos;re looking at and how we also care about the environment , so we can actually be able to think about it .
as the as i &apos;m <unk> , and when i &apos;m <unk> , it &apos;s a whole different way of being there , and if you have a living in .
because in the way we do this new kind of design , the natural natural species , for example , the natural ones , are five times faster at the average time .
and the kind of thing we &apos;re going to do is because we see the one on the one that &apos;s new media , social media media , facebook and so on .
in fact , the way that &apos;s not been <unk> is not only a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , if i want to use these devices to do this .
and when i say to someone , give me salt or or , or , he &apos;ll be thinking about the right , where it &apos;s going to be .
of course , the way that the doesn &apos;t only do the with the topic of perceptions and <unk> <unk> or <unk> , but of course , with the subject of the <unk> .
and then i can go back to the past , and so i can do a very elegant <unk> for example , for example , when i know this phenomenon .
so you really need to look at detail when i want to do something more or intuitive or a little bit of what &apos;s called the core .
so much of natural gas , in a spaces , but i see directly in the way that salt and looks at the same time .
and just just the way , the left , and i &apos;m hopefully , that &apos;s not a sugar in this , and the salt is going to give you a salt .
not , if i &apos;m a local studio , the neighbor is less , it doesn &apos;t make it all over .
and what does it mean to do , because how do our work work and how are our channels of the perception and how does the cognitive work is ?
there are more on the <unk> , on the <unk> , which we &apos;re looking at , of course , as a course of the , of course , is .
so , a whole , very different process , like certain things and things happen to happen .
if i saw that , that &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s in there , you know .
but i want to say that there &apos;s a graph for us to do a nice <unk> , also , to make things .
because they &apos;re often getting people , they can &apos;t make it <unk> , so they can do it with it .
you &apos;re also doing , too , as you &apos;re talking about , the subject of perception and the <unk> .
and she &apos;s a statement , and she &apos;s a bit of what you see , and i see what you &apos;re looking at , <unk> circle .
so back to my actual theme of sound , the interface , which is , of course , is <unk> , is <unk> .
can i use that directly or i need to do it for a n , or i need to make a sign of it .
i &apos;m looking at this is that the always is going to be the <unk> for the success , which is just a <unk> .
but this is a essential important important important , if you also want to design things like that , you know , to design things .
i &apos;ve got a cognitive mind , you have what you see .
that i &apos;m not making it different and more beautiful , which is not that it &apos;s better .
because there &apos;s a fantastic jobs to say , you know , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
this is called <unk> or <unk> , which is also <unk> us in our perception .
so we have the eyes and now now think we &apos;re going to see from the back of the back .
you &apos;ll never forget more than i &apos;m going to show you where the <unk> is .
now i know it &apos;s now , and now i &apos;m going to look at the <unk> .
that is , this first impression , is happening in a very fast speed , as we perceive things .
many people are the word , don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to be to detail .
the important thing for the key is that they have the most common , the great <unk> .
sounds like , but it &apos;s interesting to be , if you &apos;re getting closer to it , you &apos;re closer to a lot .
and then back back , and then it &apos;s just about it .
so there &apos;s a <unk> function that &apos;s going to be so possible , so that &apos;s what happens to the things that are happening .
that &apos;s all the whole thing that &apos;s going to do , but it &apos;s also a lot of course .
if we have the world and we &apos;re getting faster and always better and better .
then the next generation we actually live in today is still even living .
this is the pressure of pressure and <unk> <unk> <unk> and other <unk> .
and to look , how do we process information , how do we take information ?
and a second circle is starting to find certain or or to interact with .
there are <unk> , where i know where i know where i &apos;m going to do .
so no longer all the ones and you have to have or <unk> or <unk> .
so i &apos;m using a lot of the behavior that i think is really what behavior looks like .
the next generation of the <unk> is working on a lot more with behavior .
but then , then , the script , then , as a <unk> , was a <unk> .
and these two worlds are just just in new and old .
but now it &apos;s not more open at the local level , but it &apos;s a global level .
but also , our perception itself , how are they going to be us .
the next phenomenon , which is also interesting to the internet .
and of course , how powerful design is to the perception .
<unk> near the <unk> of the continuity and so on .
that &apos;s also there , and then it goes back .
so , the same thing i &apos;ve described is what i &apos;ve described .
and this is this <unk> of the surface , <unk> , see .
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know about knowledge as a designer .
that &apos;s the period of most of the individuals that we have .
it was how it happened to be the village .
and how is it that it &apos;s in there ?
there &apos;s more likely to be more than my glasses .
i don &apos;t know who you know who you know .
that &apos;s the period that you love .
so , how does a human deal with certain things .
we understood that the weather is the weather .
so how do we work if we &apos;re there ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
now , everybody &apos;s trying to tell you this pattern .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a whole interesting phenomenon .
alone , what is the information ?
and then , you know , you &apos;re always seeing it .
so &apos;s how the norm is going to be .
the subject of ecology is a global .
often , in the third , again , again .
you see , looking at the back of the back .
i don &apos;t know who what &apos;s going on .
anybody know what three seconds are ?
it &apos;s just to process it as a present .
how can i make something like this ?
and less <unk> , or <unk> , it &apos;s .
for example , in the context of context .
does anybody know what this is ?
so it &apos;s a real circle .
that &apos;s also a paradigm .
<unk> <unk> should be still .
now you can see the <unk> .
it &apos;s a very interesting phenomenon .
you have to understand that .
does something a special ?
a <unk> , right .
i see the <unk> .
that &apos;s our present .
what &apos;s <unk> milliseconds ?
that &apos;s wrong .
all right , yeah .
yes , milliseconds .
<unk> on .
why ?
and if i &apos;m going to do this , for example , i &apos;m going to be a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in the case , it comes up to me , i can see it &apos;s in detail , and yes , <unk> , i can read it to be somewhere or or <unk> , and so on .
the first one is when you &apos;re going to be a child , when baby is a child , they have so much , yes , and the depending after their parents have to have more or less than their parents play and to sit down , and more , of course , will be able to do the curiosity , of course ,
and where you see how far away from that way we really wanted to do that , and how sad we are , we can see that we &apos;re on the earth , you can see that for example , for example , a program is going to be a program , you want to be here , right ?
it &apos;s more complex <unk> <unk> , and with this sentence , i want to close , a demo and again , also , to think differently , also have to think differently , and in this sense , thank you very much for your attention and asking .
and if i take a step in these these , i &apos;m going to look at a couple of these these <unk> , by the way , by <unk> , by definition , and not to keep the mouse , and a funny and i can get it still and even even more .
the model is already <unk> in the utero and is <unk> , so it &apos;s working in the world with young and old , and all of us used to use all the time , without that , that the most common time is there .
because that &apos;s because i can get the things like the <unk> , and they can come to me , is more natural as if about <unk> , or more of the <unk> of the web , or other kinds of things , or any other mechanisms .
that we feel like we feel guilty on earth , we say , there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and as you &apos;re all wearing , that we allow them to go back to the future .
and if you &apos;re going to tell people that when you say it &apos;s a <unk> , you &apos;re not going to be better , you &apos;re not going to be there , and it &apos;s going to be <unk> and forth .
when you &apos;re intuitive and then i have to take my little friend here , and look , what does that mean , what does that mean , when you &apos;re a little bit of the , when is a really natural thing ?
we want to be good for the society , we want to be good for the economy , but the highest thing is not there , right ?
so , if we look at the phone , we can actually see the whole thing from a on something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can do it as a computer .
<unk> <unk> is about 50 to the <unk> of us ever , so you have to see the way that we have , in your sleep , it &apos;s less often being <unk> as a day .
and through that kind of transmission , the way that the metaphor of the <unk> , but now not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> .
and because it &apos;s physically much harder to work than we &apos;re , and because they only live three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , they &apos;re doing a billion people in the energy , in the energy of a billion people .
we &apos;ve only been in the for two years , and now it &apos;s going to be a lot of uranium in the world &apos;s going to be made up in the environment than all of the <unk> .
it &apos;s so amazing to us , we &apos;re doing something about what &apos;s actually going to work , but it &apos;s not like that .
that &apos;s why all of these are are and curious , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then weigh the ants around more than we &apos;re people .
and where you see , even at something like , the <unk> <unk> , agriculture , doesn &apos;t make that own <unk> back .
now , of course , the question is , what &apos;s the most popular human history of us , and now i &apos;ve been able to do it .
we &apos;re going to build more stable , and we &apos;re going to lose between between 11 and <unk> , or on the liquid , or on the parking meter .
and so someone says al gore , one of our big heroes , there &apos;s nothing more than human population .
i could also close to a little bit of the other , but in the united states , nobody &apos;s going to see it , in the way , they &apos;re vegetarian .
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a great footprint that &apos;s useful .
that means i can put a intuitive , human <unk> , in a software , and it &apos;s going to make a software that makes the very little amount of <unk> .
that &apos;s all of you all of them , but it &apos;s just <unk> , and it &apos;s sort of <unk> , or it &apos;s also the same .
so when we think about the <unk> to the <unk> , our entire world , we &apos;re going to be a computer , and we &apos;re going to have a few <unk> .
i can make the entire whole , now , can have the national and , and i can tell me just with a lot of things .
every day , they give them and give them scale , and they &apos;re going to give them two of the phosphorus phosphorus and every day you have to have two of the phosphorus phosphorus .
and this is on a higher posted of the <unk> , which is the transmission of a classical metaphor , which is the <unk> .
this is all of us and <unk> is a hot and stands for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
now , i &apos;m about this now , basically , this whole <unk> , <unk> , 40 years old , in quality .
this is as if i would say , <unk> your child , it &apos;s only three times three times .
but that &apos;s going to lead me back to the point when things are going to be really intuitive ?
and that &apos;s for us , is something that is always a little more important when i have to think about it .
i can now use this mental <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
in the last 20 years , we have been <unk> tons of uranium of living in our fields in germany .
and we think we would protect the environment , if we &apos;re a little bit of less connected .
that means that our whole intelligence means we &apos;re going to be a trees , right ?
that means we &apos;re losing the ground for the more likely to be growing .
every year , we lose three million tons of phosphorus , which is to be able to put into the field of stuff .
anyway : now i &apos;m able to do the object , again , again , again , <unk> .
and then suddenly , a interface and a lot of natural gas is a lot of natural .
in israel , you can see a human <unk> , you put the earth .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we are we , yes , yes ?
that means all our intelligence intelligence , we want to be a trees .
we &apos;re doing this in china for example , where we are right the way that we take the power .
so he really like to think about it , but it just simply make it happen .
for example , in <unk> , for example , the <unk> 20 percent of the world &apos;s <unk> now is .
we think we &apos;re in the <unk> , we &apos;re too many of the world .
in china , a <unk> today is a <unk> today , is a <unk> today , right ?
and in our western world , we were always stupid , our nutrients were always <unk> .
and the most important thing is , when the ground is , as a result .
so , we could that , of course , about ten percent , but what does that do ?
because the phosphorus is going to be the way that the features of the <unk> are <unk> .
it &apos;s certainly making sense of being more harmful , which is what <unk> .
we &apos;re doing in brazil in the where we are the nutrients .
we can actually do it in agriculture , in agriculture .
because everybody &apos;s talking about energy , but no one &apos;s talking about the <unk> .
so for example , <unk> the environment , the less car .
so the question is , how do we go with these kinds of these ?
and one of the most interesting people that are not to do is that men are not pigs .
you can only be <unk> if you don &apos;t exist , right ?
the less i kind of think about it , the intuitive is it .
i want to make you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
and because we &apos;re getting older , it will be larger .
here it says , the more you have , the more better .
what have you heard about <unk> trees from trees ?
you can only have <unk> , if you don &apos;t .
even if you would look at it , you would have emissions .
we could just be <unk> as a <unk> <unk> .
if we don &apos;t have phosphorus and we &apos;re going to get a phosphorus .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
that means that ants weigh much more than us .
there are still a lot of the trees that are still in the <unk> .
that &apos;s how you start to think about the <unk> .
on the ground , over over a percent of the <unk> stored .
this is what they &apos;re all in the <unk> .
and there &apos;s a central point in this .
we can see , of course , the <unk> .
this is going to be in china in a second .
because that &apos;s why , right ?
have you seen a tree tree ?
and what does that mean for designers ?
i &apos;m going to try this for a <unk> .
so everybody has already ate pies .
and the curiosity don &apos;t learn .
the environment , making less waste .
the environment , the environment , <unk> less energy .
this is just a little bit less destruction .
and everything is packaging or content .
one baby takes about six <unk> .
so , you can &apos;t be pigs .
so , you can &apos;t solve that .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
we &apos;re on to two countries .
and we &apos;re taking it all over .
in the people across the neighborhood .
there &apos;s no <unk> in trees .
and so we &apos;re too many .
that &apos;s the so-called called <unk> .
and the depends on the phosphorus .
they can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone bone .
the most expensive thing is a lot of critical .
it &apos;s in women &apos;s heart .
but that &apos;s not protection .
luckily , not , right ?
so we are too many .
but where are we useful ?
we can put our nutrition .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
that &apos;s completely clear .
let me tell you .
there &apos;s no tree .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
we can do it differently .
the only chance .
<unk> , yes ?
one one ?
alone .
yeah ?
yeah .
yeah .
yes ?
yes ?
this is really nice about this , when you do this , it &apos;s made of agriculture , on a acres of a <unk> land in the row , a farmer for a hundred dollars , and the infrastructure for it , and it &apos;s going to be <unk> , and and and the fishes and the fishes and the fish and fishes and fish
not the <unk> , even a little bit better , and it &apos;s not even more to burn it and to lose the whole materials for the rest of the time , but first time , how do you use ?
it &apos;s not direct for the company , not for the company , but it &apos;s not that you can help this this company to do these products .
even today , even if you &apos;re invited to lunch , you &apos;re expected to eat that they &apos;re going to stay on the toilet , until you get the toilet .
imagine if your wife is sad sad if you have a little bit of your wife , and you &apos;ve got to have a dead .
and it &apos;s a happy thing , when you see in the deep bow of the high bow so that you can get from the car .
that means that the entire western western <unk> , that the city has ever taken , but the farmers never have to have a little bit .
and by the way , if you want to do what they want , it &apos;s the best to put in germany , in the best way , the best to be in .
just the things that <unk> the <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , who have to be so that they go into biological systems .
these are the first shoes that you can do with the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> can go to the <unk> , and can go to the plant , right ?
and so , the cities had to grow more , because the farmers had to go into the cities and the cities to grow up their their nutrients and move their own nutrients .
and none of these facilities , we have now built over <unk> , in the last 20 years , not ever been <unk> .
that &apos;s not about making the existing existing value , but it &apos;s about making something really .
but a <unk> , even at this lighting , can i tell you , is completely inefficient , but all of the effective , but all the way that i do ?
and if it &apos;s to do , it &apos;s us for us to do it for for , for nike , for <unk> and all the census of the whole industry .
that means everything that matters in life is not about saving , to avoid avoid .
we can do things now that they when they go , when they <unk> , they can put them into biological biological .
so , when i go to the food and say , you know , that &apos;s free , you don &apos;t help you .
when i go to dinner , i &apos;m saying , you know , there &apos;s a <unk> and a glass of water and a glass of water .
so , about all the western rich are always , until they don &apos;t have the infrastructure to have them , and they &apos;re <unk> .
you &apos;ve got <unk> civilization over over the years because you &apos;ve been able to get the nutrients out of the ground .
because the soil is going down , the mosses are going to die and the wind and the water is the natural water .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every unit is that the water remains longer in the memory .
it &apos;s not the fact that it &apos;s not exactly because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> is going to be .
so you could simply easily take a liter of <unk> and then would be the facility over over years .
and unfortunately , not in the <unk> , but maybe you can do the <unk> , a little bit of a little bit .
and the great thing about this is that the average <unk> in the average line is about about about for about six percent .
and they &apos;re so designed by the design that you can just give you a farmer .
the latest government has explained , they will be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus <unk> .
in the spirit of what we understand , of course , because in the company , it &apos;s built in flowers .
so , it &apos;s about creating a great footprint that becomes a becomes a place .
you know , there are two countries that control almost almost almost almost percent of the world &apos;s population .
every place where you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re going to do it again .
and it contains seeds plants , so they &apos;re using the <unk> for the <unk> .
a television or a machine , they use it , they don &apos;t use it .
that means you can see the nutrients of how you can put nutrients .
that means we don &apos;t need to control the people , to be bad .
we say , people , yes , you don &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> in south .
but when i ask you , how do you care about your wife ?
we designed for a <unk> , which is a <unk> , which is a lot of the liquid .
and that &apos;s the half of all the world &apos;s entire world that are caused by the million .
you &apos;ve got them to eat them , not to the <unk> .
so we don &apos;t need to control the people , to be very bad .
a woman in germany is about three three three pounds of their life .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re going to be with , asking them to the people .
and to ask you , all of the time , what is the right thing .
a everything that is beautiful is not efficient .
the things that are used to work in technical systems .
and i &apos;m not sure if you really get it .
because it &apos;s all to go and get the nutrients .
that &apos;s of course , of course , is <unk> , but the most dangerous thing .
these are <unk> countries that control the percent of the <unk> control .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency .
all that &apos;s beautiful is not efficient .
if you go to the wrong things , you have a <unk> .
if you run , yes , everybody &apos;s all the the floor .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less advanced now .
because we don &apos;t make things like that , because we don &apos;t do things .
because the <unk> facility could be the best of the phosphorus .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
we &apos;ve now used over three years now .
and the oil is going to be able to do through other including us .
no , the diameter is right , right ?
you can go to <unk> where you go and stand .
there &apos;s a bunch of <unk> of <unk> .
because you know , this is a <unk> process .
it &apos;s kind of <unk> , right ?
but today we &apos;re talking about the biological systems .
no , we noticed what &apos;s inside .
but it &apos;s all that it &apos;s useful .
hey , <unk> , do you really do really seriously ?
because now they already have twice the <unk> .
so , help me do a little bit .
we can support them , well , we can be good .
that &apos;s where the go back to the <unk> .
we can support them , to be good .
and we see that it &apos;s very .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace you .
if you love yourself in somebody , efficient ?
then i say , <unk> <unk> , right ?
but with the right design , please .
they &apos;re building in two hours .
that means we need to <unk> phosphorus .
but all right , so , ?
that &apos;s not an energy , but it &apos;s essential .
questions about what is the right ?
in how we think of north .
so it &apos;s not saving , sick , avoid .
you can show , i was there .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been looking at .
imagine that they &apos;re used to efficient .
that &apos;s just the minimum .
not , of course , is supposed to be <unk> .
for example , the <unk> , right ?
technical scientists , the same thing .
in china , it was different .
the cup is clean water .
but we need the overall .
or take a <unk> .
there is every footprint in there .
we say in germany .
so , it &apos;s two <unk> .
everything of it is <unk> .
and that has to be back .
wonderful , &quot; good ?
but the wrong things .
what do you say ?
every waste is <unk> .
so not like <unk> .
it &apos;s not that .
that &apos;s efficient .
all the time .
not toxic .
but it &apos;s .
completely inefficient .
not <unk> .
that &apos;s .
yes ?
yes ?
that &apos;s .
yes ?
yes ?
yes ?
sustainable .
yeah ?
yes ?
positive .
yeah .
that you can &apos;t even think of the word for word for the word , in a different language , but also the deeper sense of the words and understanding of the word , to make a structural translation , knows anybody who has to do it with <unk> .
if we change the plastics , it can go back into biological systems , if we change the <unk> , it can be <unk> back , and then you can put a baby in israel or in the middle of the trees , or the trees , in the <unk> trees .
how you &apos;re a new new day , and every time you &apos;ve always been the same rituals of life , up , ted , , to work , to work , so that i &apos;m the same piece of time , and the same thing is , as you go back to new
so i would like to translate that all of you to be in german , because if i had to translate it , it would be to translate for translation translation , it would be translation .
so since now , the notes of all others are being a <unk> of the court of the great , but only a framework , i turn to this framework to sense and meaning it .
but you also have a lot of the public , you have a rich knowledge to the composers that you play in action and it &apos;s always easier to feel in it and feel it .
i &apos;ve got a day of getting older , my heart , my my driving , goes down , at the morning , in a <unk> , takes longer time to keep back back home .
because in this <unk> , <unk> is the smell of the flowers , not smell , the amount of <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , not feeling .
it &apos;s always a very happy very popular state , if i can have the experience , that i have to have a little bit of the same , and i &apos;ve been able to experience that long as we see .
there &apos;s also a lot of the time for the <unk> learning , just as you can understand , or you can &apos;t speak to anything to the musical .
it was on a <unk> for <unk> , my beloved old old teacher , professor <unk> , a famous <unk> , <unk> and explains <unk> professor of the <unk> here in <unk> .
if you go to all the time , and you look like it &apos;s in the notes , you get the sound that sounds like the music .
it can be more from the german to english , which is more of a lot of the first time when you &apos;re to be able to get to or even poetry .
i &apos;m going to have more than now , and i &apos;m going to be a lot of my stem stem than today , and i have a lot of more <unk> , of emotions and feeling like that .
so it &apos;s not a way of learning notes , and it &apos;s not to learn to get the piano on the piano or the right place to push the right place on a <unk> .
but i had the great fortune , him , and i was close to 50 years , and i was going to be my home on my illness .
i was at the time , when i was at a <unk> , and then i was playing the last of the four of the four of the same piece of viruses , a <unk> .
after you &apos;re having a piece of chose , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re excited to be <unk> to the number of different .
it &apos;s great to make this kind of music , and you have to have the audience , the music is alive .
it must be to me , and now i can be <unk> , but i can &apos;t convince my audience to convince you that that &apos;s my cause .
i &apos;m playing today today , and i &apos;ll be able to do it , and it &apos;s been for me , although i &apos;m not really aware of it , even though there &apos;s no single note .
a kid who didn &apos;t have learned to sing , because the parents don &apos;t have to have the parents , it &apos;s not going to do it .
in the description of my speech , i wrote that i am as a <unk> , as a <unk> , , in english <unk> , i understand .
everybody says , every time , you get a sense of it , because i &apos;m feeling it , because it &apos;s my now my personal personal job .
these notes are about just as much or or <unk> , like a act of a , , a lot of a landscape .
that is , the process needs to be <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , which is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
it &apos;s exciting because then things we don &apos;t have to do that , and what we can &apos;t do is not samples .
he &apos;s translated the <unk> <unk> , as he saw it , as she saw it , it &apos;s the way you see it in this moment .
and i think , again , i &apos;m going to look at the notes , even if i can &apos;t take it .
because that &apos;s that to make music on the instrument of the instrument that are going to be able to do your musical musical and feel that there should be there before .
and if you take these these wild , they &apos;re <unk> , and the other person to plant trees to the trees .
now i want to tell you what i would like to translate on my entire life , so it &apos;s even more language .
you think that the reputation in the notes has exactly everything else has been doing .
his claim to write the piece of writing is more and more and to my personal vision , it &apos;s playing it .
you read in the &quot; <unk> , &quot; notes , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts from the composers .
it &apos;s also quite wonderful , if i &apos;m standing on a stage on the stage , and we &apos;ve got the same places .
unfortunately , i was too young too young , so he was <unk> , i thought , i was beginning to study .
you think about this time in the way , by looking at contemporary images , or literature .
this is the first ecological backpack , actually , that &apos;s made for the circulation in the cycle .
so no longer save , rid of , rid of reduce , reduce , no , but it &apos;s a waste of waste .
so , you need to think about the music of the music for the same as long as the word language .
now for me , and for the composers , and what you might mean for him today is today .
now i &apos;m also as far as a farm with a <unk> age , when he wrote the piece of writing .
i said , you know , you need to be about for the word for the spoken language .
very specific , it &apos;s a <unk> thing to do with our <unk> .
so , the music works for me as the word language .
i &apos;m going to say my own words what could be written between this framework .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some <unk> , but i &apos;m going to have some <unk> in this room .
so , one example of a very different deal of this is the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but at different <unk> , at <unk> light .
you learn basically before you read it before you just talk about one word .
but even though you &apos;re going to put these <unk> , it &apos;s still still a little bit .
there &apos;s a little bit of the top , but you know , but in the landscape , yeah ?
that &apos;s the baby &apos;s baby &apos;s life for the whole , already from beginning to .
and that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the meaning of the letters you can see is that you can actually do the language .
all of that influenced me and all this is what my experience is to do .
you bring a new idea in this , and it &apos;s going to be the answer with a reaction .
well , with japanese , you have to dreams , but not a lot of real memories .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because over again , i &apos;m reading something new .
and the one is the most obvious thing that you learn to learn is the notes .
well , there &apos;s a little bit , and it &apos;s a little bit of a piece of play .
now , working with a lot of people , and they can all be involved .
there &apos;s extra one of them to get <unk> , where everyone can &apos;t .
the leader will be more to the friend that you &apos;re living with .
well , how do you start to speak the language of music ?
you learn to sound notes to the notes on the instrument .
so , that &apos;s what you can do in every shop , you can get things out of the .
so we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
you were studied the work that he was before and after .
how about the circumstances of how society and politics ?
he asked me what the was the <unk> of this <unk> .
when it happens , the students get the <unk> of the <unk> piece .
i &apos;ve just got a <unk> of a <unk> , i just had the only notes .
the <unk> notes have the function of the letters of a string .
the work of the work starts like a <unk> .
i play <unk> what these could have done to do .
i take the breathe of the audience , or you &apos;re conscious .
then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
i &apos;m never going to play as play as a moment .
i &apos;m wonder that you often do a whole lot of <unk> .
in the countries where people are getting money .
i can &apos;t play as in 20 years today .
because the grades are the only connection to him .
according and <unk> , <unk> , and b , etc .
<unk> &apos;s a <unk> &apos;s the first notes in music music .
in fact , the notes are very exciting and <unk> .
you throw information over the piece of the <unk> .
to keep <unk> , right with the composers .
do you remember the hot water ?
it &apos;s sort of a <unk> <unk> .
and in my case , i told you , expectation .
the <unk> interpretation of a wire is that it &apos;s a similar .
especially if he &apos;s died .
there &apos;s a direct <unk> for this .
if you come to that , yeah ?
there are all these <unk> around , almost .
we can do everything that &apos;s going to be .
so every concert , a very obvious hit .
and he <unk> , and he said , &quot; right ?
he lived only years ago .
it &apos;s going to be not going to talk about the other thing .
and still , it &apos;s not all that .
if you &apos;re the right now .
i sent a institute .
so , a translation of translation .
the <unk> to write it .
how did he go ?
have a nice example of this .
this is a <unk> part .
because for me , she means it .
that &apos;s got to be the <unk> .
he was already about a bigger .
his personal personal <unk> .
most of you here are here .
we can do that .
do you think that &apos;s curious ?
the work of the work .
you &apos;re looking at them .
all of this is all interested .
yes , it &apos;s kind of .
music as language .
<unk> , slowly .
i wonder .
that &apos;s what sing .
thank you .
yeah ?
yes ?
because we have the self-deception , this feeling , not to be great , from the highest , not from such a organism , which is a <unk> , a <unk> , a trick , and the things that things that , that is for us to take us
so what you can see is how slowly this mechanism is up and like the traces that he &apos;s leaving , which is that the way that the subject of ourselves , to give us a different story of ourselves , i want to give you another story .
if you &apos;re in a environments where adults are active or at least active music , a child , a child , it &apos;s very easy to ask a <unk> , ask what color has your flower ?
and in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to try and figure out if they can &apos;t yet , or learn how to get these little muscles that the living people who make it right .
on this point , if you &apos;re laughing , you know how important this lie is and how much time you need to be able to experience something , what artists can be us .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of music , to have a little more , so that it &apos;s a to make a problem to make sound .
but think about the lie , as you may have heard of it , if people say , no one has to make a wall wall .
you know , this idea of the lady that every morning in the mirror and looked at him , and he asked , who is the most beautiful in the country ?
i mean , there &apos;s some of you who say , yes , but what do you do if if i can &apos;t sing ?
and what happens when you play a piece today , which is originally a hundred , or a hundred years ago , or any years ago ?
i can take the <unk> that the the first time , the first run , the modern wing , what a <unk> can &apos;t do .
the artist &apos;s artists with them , and particularly , and mostly , of this lady , what you see is that you look at the mirror .
people who have never had , before , never have immediately with their own body , like it &apos;s like to form a sound .
the artists of artists are showing you what they &apos;re going to be familiar with , if you look at this piece of artwork , you know , that &apos;s going to be again .
and you also know how much of this true of this true , even the mirrors can &apos;t lie from this true of true .
because i don &apos;t think it says , i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s me , because i &apos;m not cooking .
the food that &apos;s been used by a formal farm or a chef , has to be eaten , and not only to be able to get to or to build .
but we should just make us familiar with that , that you can &apos;t tell a woman that &apos;s there in a different way .
and not only in art , also in the arts , in the mythology , in the mythology , in stories .
and then she ran her to her husband and she said , &quot; that &apos;s probably not true , what charles there .
today , an modern orchestra is able to play everything to play , which is a <unk> , and then <unk> .
i think the only thing that would be been excited if he had the most advanced possibility of modern modern art .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about to do that , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing to themselves .
so here you have this mechanism that we can use the lie as a great invention to the <unk> of our <unk> .
we need to think about this place that we can &apos;t <unk> the deception that we cannot be .
that man &apos;s man should be <unk> , and yes , at least there was an common ancestors between people and monkeys .
i &apos;m asking you , &quot; do you sing , a , because you believe you can &apos;t sing ?
so they &apos;re also learning to do something more and more than they &apos;re having some more little more than just or just taste .
so , when i come out with my little little legs , and i &apos;m going to get to the right , and i &apos;m going to get it .
and then it feels like this awkward feeling , you couldn &apos;t see it , and it &apos;s always going to be more like this .
we have not just been in the art , in the <unk> , but also in science , we have to lie with this amazing question .
we need to prevent that people are actually the people of things , particularly if they &apos;re true .
our organism has a great method to make such such emotions like like just to get out of the disappear .
i &apos;d like to explain with you something today , or something , or something , which is probably familiar with you .
yes , you feel it &apos;s when you &apos;re <unk> in this place , and that &apos;s something wrong .
or d , they don &apos;t like music and want to have so much for this .
they heard from this book from charles darwin , the origin of the species and the humans .
she came from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told a student from a student .
but what i would say is regret is a beautiful thing , <unk> thing .
i &apos;m sure , but it &apos;s really , you know , you can &apos;t tell you , or not .
and the child play , after a <unk> , instead of a red flower , instead of a blue flower .
he also knows that he had more than he had to hear more than he had already had .
at a look at a lie , the liars doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
so here &apos;s needed to do that , which we understand under <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s going to again .
and if it &apos;s true , we need to prevent that people will have to do it .
well , you see , you have to be a <unk> of a <unk> .
or what i &apos;m going to do today , because what you might have thought of .
why do we prevent that people know that people will be something like ?
you don &apos;t need to make yourself music if it &apos;s going to be a bored .
every single music will be <unk> if you &apos;re going to be <unk> down the outside .
have you already have a <unk> or <unk> <unk> , how do you say it &apos;s beautiful ?
so , it doesn &apos;t take any food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to be rid of classical music because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
so the composers of us are focused on <unk> that are reinventing the pieces of reinventing .
they need this lie to a <unk> to get a self-deception to get a self-deception .
this woman has turned out to be the front , and you couldn &apos;t see the way that he was going to look .
or c , because you &apos;ve got to have it , you know , that they &apos;re <unk> .
but they don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand anything of the classical music .
stop them and tell you whether it &apos;s not or not .
it makes a little bit of easy to make it very different in the sense .
they can &apos;t get them to make it , yes , <unk> , or even as it can bring .
and because i &apos;m sick , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
why do i now tell you about my audience that it &apos;s working on it ?
because the music is a language and a language is there to communicate .
a piece of art that you never never look at is not going to be a force .
so you &apos;re going to become a huge thing in the mind .
i say , <unk> , what do you need to do ?
and as i say the word justice , this is a <unk> feeling .
you can also try to talk about words or or <unk> or something .
and one day , that &apos;s the mirror , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> .
and this is the story of the woman &apos;s <unk> of <unk> .
she likes to love him because he &apos;s got a tendency to have .
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire .
our lives to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
the tune from the <unk> and the rhythm from the dance .
no need to use a <unk> to kill or sing .
or b , because they didn &apos;t have to come to sing ?
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
so please listen to a music when music is being .
and there was no time to do at the instrument of the instrument yet .
and what you &apos;re thinking about today is what you think of today .
it &apos;s probably lose the first year of the first year of half his value .
and then <unk> <unk> , so he &apos;ll tell you the story .
from that time , a anecdote that you might know .
the person should be from the monkeys or a common ancestors .
so the piano <unk> in the piano of my fingers .
the most <unk> nowadays is not <unk> with music .
i &apos;m going to ask how <unk> did this disease ?
whether music is to <unk> or cute .
that was the first beginning of a very musical expression .
and even , you know , i &apos;m a lot less than me .
so why would i afford to be a <unk> car ?
and then i immediately immediately , that &apos;s a little bit .
the spanish painter <unk> once a woman &apos;s <unk> .
and she asked him what is that you mean ?
but you might have to be able to get them too .
so , can you play me in blue ?
i have a friend who goes to a <unk> .
he &apos;s just not only <unk> them .
so , we can &apos;t do these things .
one of the time with your own breath .
the instrument is that , the extension of our body .
because artists have a <unk> relationship to the lie .
because we can &apos;t live without those <unk> .
a particularly beautiful story , like i mean .
tell what they feel .
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
and this sounds very different than before .
so the first step in a interpretation .
behind the seven and so forth .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
now , the instruments have been <unk> .
it was not invented .
you know what &apos;s wrong ?
and how did that feel ?
i &apos;m going to put something through the head .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
so , they wait , wait .
my wife told me .
this is how we &apos;re in the <unk> .
you can train that .
did you know ?
it &apos;s against the justice .
it will always be more .
you need time .
a <unk> student .
thank you .
suck .
and if you have people who have been <unk> , or you can also say that they have been a soul , or they have been able to do a soul that &apos;s like a soul , not matter , but it &apos;s just like the soul of flesh , it itself , from the flesh , to the earth , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , yes .
here you have this <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk> , which immediately immediately , without doing something about it , and the things that you know , you know , they &apos;re very different , and so they can look at a lot better , so they can sound that they can do a lot better for them and other people .
i &apos;m probably a lot of the old girls still , i &apos;m probably a little bit of the generation that &apos;s been concerned for this bad image , because i &apos;ve started to study in <unk> , in <unk> , i think , is , i think , is , i think , &quot; .
so if you have this idea that you have to be kind of , you &apos;re going to be driven by the larger bunch of the larger amount of information that you immediately have , you know , quickly , that it &apos;s going to give you a free will .
but with this logic that just uses two sentences that two sentences are correct , and a third <unk> , which looks like he &apos;s going to do something so that we can &apos;t save our lives .
and if you have a way to feel that , you know , in the way that <unk> people , you do it , because you &apos;re going to be happy happy , you &apos;re not going to remember that .
so , according to this logic , these self-deception , the one , another reality , one of the other reality that we know in the most common knowledge is that they &apos;re critical to the outside .
and now they can simply do if they want to do anything , if they want to test yourself , and when they &apos;re going to do anything , they want to be able to do this , and they &apos;re going to open to the lie on the lie .
i &apos;m grateful grateful to that , because the word was <unk> , because after the <unk> , you wouldn &apos;t use the word anymore , because it was left .
no , it looks much better , if we &apos;re showing that we &apos;re dealing with that , the risks of the other people are only able to do it if they &apos;re fire .
it &apos;s a third sentence that doesn &apos;t have nothing to do with the first two sentences , and it &apos;s as if the opposite of the first sentence is already and .
and when this <unk> then goes through the people , then he &apos;s going to be able to deal with the spirit of the world , with nature , with nature , who can be able to live with it .
and now from this soul , you think that you kind of like this in this nature nature , in nature , is the <unk> , is the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do it , the first sentence of the first thing is , you have to be able to take the point without proof .
i &apos;ve told my wife , whenever a human being is using a moral , because i &apos;m using it , we should try to replace it through the <unk> .
this one <unk> that suggests that the <unk> in the room knew that it &apos;s actually related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t tell you that .
and if you have to be able to face this , you know , the logic of that we &apos;re trying to do is to improve a way of a lie in a lie .
this is a look like this , who don &apos;t have any <unk> , can &apos;t be passed for his actions and claims for the responsibility and it &apos;s therefore <unk> .
just if you make a different example of it , if you get a little bit more , it doesn &apos;t need any reason , and it doesn &apos;t have any reason , and it &apos;s not a good thing .
and i was going to be in the &apos; 70s , in berlin because i wanted to do this in <unk> , and i was not in <unk> .
because while they &apos;re busy with , you know , they &apos;re not able to prove that they can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no <unk> , the man &apos;s husband .
there &apos;s a <unk> that is called international <unk> , and by saying , you &apos;re saying , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; there &apos;s no <unk> .
she &apos;s one of the most impressive here from this great event and asked me if i &apos;m going to play a talk and i would have a idea .
there was a way that there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> , where you were the evil .
and <unk> , you know , his teacher didn &apos;t want to be able to go down and put it down , if the fire was <unk> .
the first example of what many of you know , and some of them are , very few , don &apos;t even have to do it .
now , we can take the second sentence and say , if you can see , if scientists are right , he &apos;s quite no <unk> .
practice for example , if you can meet a human , you can &apos;t say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
be the place of the <unk> , but that was an <unk> and has changed and done , and i started the same .
but it &apos;s like the n <unk> , which is sort of a hundred hundred from the square , that it was a toy .
but there &apos;s no <unk> , which we can actually see where to do , where you can do fire .
it &apos;s only to be interested in the front of the need to be able to prove that there are <unk> .
i have to say , you know , you &apos;ve got to be honest , i think , to talk to me about my idea .
so just as simple as these words , we have to use the language of the political political man .
and if we &apos;re in <unk> , you know , in <unk> , i think , you know , i &apos;m going to take the <unk> for the process .
immediately , you &apos;ll be one of the reasons that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> , you know , that you can &apos;t prove .
and what we find now is we can read almost every day in the daily sentence .
a third set of the immediately immediately immediately , who have a strong feeling for a soul .
so , we do , if it &apos;s impossible , it &apos;s impossible to live without a soul .
in the present , we have a very modern example of this , and it &apos;s a very modern example of the time .
there was one <unk> , who was called <unk> and after the <unk> , named named <unk> .
so , you have to think of another <unk> theme , a <unk> from philosophy , the future of the philosophy .
and if you put the exactly in the middle of the middle , it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
because he &apos;s led to a <unk> , he doesn &apos;t care about it .
but we know , when we do that , the social is very good at the same time .
it &apos;s impossible to be doing things like a society that &apos;s going to work .
so we should be able to perceive them as something that will necessarily be our future .
so the second sentence is , when <unk> right , he &apos;s not soul .
the say , who doesn &apos;t have a soul , it &apos;s dead , and it can &apos;t say anything .
this is this logic in this , right , this is what i talk about .
you don &apos;t call it to you , it would be a little political <unk> .
so , in the way of the <unk> experience , it &apos;s the way the lie is .
because actually , we would prove , if there &apos;s the soul , or not .
and actually , you would have to prove that there &apos;s something like <unk> .
and please don &apos;t use the &quot; <unk> &quot; for <unk> , which is &quot; <unk> . &quot;
i just allowed me to ask you to see if i could call them .
and i think maybe my <unk> , i think , is that i &apos;m trying to imagine .
although i &apos;m in the fire , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
so i want to introduce you to what we found in my institute .
it &apos;s something that is not about stop <unk> , <unk> nature .
because it &apos;s like to lie , you can just use this logic wrong .
but the key thing is , if i have right , then it &apos;s .
and now our <unk> mind is immediately , and it &apos;s going to be something that we can do .
that &apos;s what we do with this is that we go back to the <unk> .
a small <unk> , which is not in the case of <unk> .
now , this is a <unk> that tells us a logic .
you need something logic , but also the ability to lie .
the first sentence is <unk> , <unk> , there &apos;s no soul .
and if i have right , the <unk> is a man .
if i don &apos;t quite have , the <unk> is not a man .
second , if he &apos;s right , he &apos;s not soul .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> , which is made of the nature of nature .
because he doesn &apos;t know what to do first to do .
you feel that , the real truth behind the power .
so i want to give you two , perhaps , three examples .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s got it .
but it &apos;s , of course , the sum of all , a lot of ideas .
the fact that the was called the <unk> , the <unk> was called <unk> .
because a good engineer has made a great cars or <unk> .
so , let &apos;s do this , and then you &apos;ll experience the sentence .
in fact , we know that something else is .
the soul is something that &apos;s happening about dust .
that &apos;s how the idea of the the soul is going to be .
because in fact , this is not a human being interested in .
there &apos;s only one second , just the fire .
and that &apos;s the most part of the way that i &apos;m talking about .
the first two sentences , the simple correct .
i can say , the <unk> is a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about what &apos;s going on .
so when you say , there &apos;s no soul .
however , it was not that as well as the <unk> .
so you should be from outside outside .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell the logic .
we can apply these things to different examples .
<unk> forces with <unk> problems to each other .
and in berlin , there was a <unk> <unk> .
because now you can use a <unk> .
<unk> , she &apos;s at school .
this is where we get to the three sentences .
and here you feel it .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
that sentences are absolutely simple and correct .
you know , there &apos;s no <unk> .
there was the <unk> of the <unk> .
so here you have this little mechanism .
we can &apos;t just do that .
and then he can <unk> .
now , there &apos;s a third sentence .
i was very here for a lot .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
automatically , he &apos;s going to go to the right idea .
again , you have it again .
and you have a problem .
thank you for your attention .
it &apos;s a lot of interest in the .
there he was .
i can claim everything .
and these things are really simple .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
this is a <unk> .
so the <unk> are <unk> .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
you see it immediately .
i can tell everything .
there &apos;s nothing at all .
yeah , good day .
the hot now is <unk> .
a <unk> , but we have a little bit of a leader , and we have a little group of a , we have , and we go back and go back and start to the next topic of the future , which is called my thinking , it &apos;s just starting to go back and start to that , that people say what the <unk> , that is not , we don &apos;t talk about it .
we also have one of these <unk> in the same size , as he says , in the hall , actually the entire dynamic behavior of this grid , so that in the hall , it &apos;s now like the back , here , the big battery here , here is the whole thing that we &apos;re going to make the grid .
if one was no longer , the <unk> , which has a completely <unk> , i &apos;ve been doing a lot of time , i &apos;ve been struggling to work on a very , very much thing , because i have all of my father &apos;s colleagues , because you have all the colleagues of my father &apos;s money , you have to do the money on your kid .
and that was really , very , very , very <unk> , and you can see that a picture of the past , which i asked myself , after 10 years , a thousand <unk> , was that the time , <unk> , <unk> , in the collective , of course , was really the way that should be the great thing .
and our goal was , we wanted to go to to finish percent of the time , and then there &apos;s another one , the last 10 , the last 10 , 20 percent of it , that &apos;s going to be very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work that you &apos;re making out of batteries .
and we have wind and the the sun and the burden and came to the conclusion , a very interesting outcome that you &apos;re looking at to the conventional system , to the future , to 20 cents a mile , about about 50 cents per gallon .
so this whole discussion , like being going right now and <unk> , <unk> , like this , in the island , we have to take care of for example , for example , to <unk> percent of the wind , so we &apos;re <unk> the wind and the sun .
we look at this network , and we see the pictures of the earth , and when it &apos;s <unk> , nine times , we &apos;re going to start a few <unk> <unk> , then we &apos;ll go back to a little bit more complicated , and then we get up again .
and the message is , we have to do this to these components , if we do our goals , 20 , 20 , 20 , 20 , 20 , 30 , 30 percent and so on , if we want to do that at all .
the question is , very simple , if you &apos;re completely different from any of the fossil or <unk> , which is somewhere in the world and you &apos;re going to be <unk> by the world , you &apos;re an island .
and i started <unk> it , and then we started with friends , i &apos;ve become a company that was <unk> , then with the <unk> of the world &apos;s greatest <unk> .
and what we &apos;ve done is , since <unk> , the hall then finished , until now , everything that was happening here , the individual system of electronics , we made it in the individual system .
you can <unk> by &apos; n , you can go through the nets , you can &apos;t do it anyway , but you can &apos;t get to the amount of dna , but you can &apos;t get rid of your memory .
the beauty is the subject that you &apos;re in this island now , basically , the <unk> can be able to get into problems that we will get to increase our deal with .
and the <unk> or the <unk> or whatever it is , is an <unk> system , a system that can be a system , which can only be in small amounts of <unk> .
so , you &apos;re going to see that there &apos;s a change in this , and it &apos;s just about this <unk> , a percent of renewables , right now .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin where we could be the electrical stage of the island in the scale of one in three precisely .
so , in the days , they &apos;re trying to do these <unk> , which are doing a little bit of a little net , which has a little bit of a little net , and that &apos;s what we do with our <unk> .
and yeah , a lot of what i said was , i realized , was very , because many , many , i &apos;ve been able to do that .
how big because it &apos;s a battery that &apos;s so much to your island , so you can go to a island of 20 , the future , maybe even about 100 percent of it .
and if you want to go over 20 , 20 percent of renewables , go to energy , energy , not the power of the time , then you have to go back to the market .
that our system has a <unk> , it &apos;s because we &apos;re doing it , we &apos;re doing to do it in a different way , and we don &apos;t have a <unk> of the other things that are not going to do .
and a lot of discussions that i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years , had to be a topic .
it will be a set of resilience , which is , hydrogen , hydrogen , power , power , you know , it &apos;s going to be a bit of a .
and our <unk> system basically is basically taken away from the <unk> of large <unk> , where the wave is all around europe .
so we &apos;re not a <unk> , but we &apos;re also define ourselves as a company that &apos;s only between the end of the subject and the subject of it , and everything between them .
yes , that &apos;s a <unk> at the moment , <unk> from the <unk> , because we don &apos;t otherwise have , or because we don &apos;t have any , because it &apos;s not .
and we &apos;re just trying to get out that you can &apos;t even get the capacity to go , and you can also get through the material in the net .
and i just just that we have the same capacity to have the same capacity to have the whole capacity of the world .
and that &apos;s a little bit of our vision of a <unk> , and i &apos;m also grateful grateful , and i &apos;m also grateful grateful , you know , solar power .
it &apos;s got a complete performance and it can take six hours for the past , and that &apos;s the battery that we have sort of <unk> .
and we just just started to start with a relatively <unk> story , where you could actually use , you could use a memory of your mind .
if we &apos;d have in europe , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was just , that was , you know , the first record was beginning to start with the first contact with the island , just by the time .
and <unk> is it &apos;s in the &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; 70s , and the <unk> , and then , and then , to the japanese .
the beauty is that i &apos;ve been experienced for the last two years , that scientists have been asking to my side .
if we miss the market , you don &apos;t have the biological mass , that &apos;s a certain turn in the net .
you have to communicate , you have to communicate , you have to communicate in the grid , and that &apos;s very complicated .
we can start to start with the <unk> , so we can start to practice , you can use the load .
so , a lot of people and look at this , because you can see , you can see what you can do .
the market is going to be <unk> and the wind , the wind , the load of it can be able to maintain the larger amount of it .
that means that you have to take care of the emissions that the renewables can &apos;t take the whole grid .
there &apos;s a little style in the small style , so you can also use your car in your car .
but if you want to take some of these <unk> , you want to build a net , and it &apos;s going to be very complicated .
and to that particular purpose , people are always going to look at and look at our <unk> on the , basically , our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion goes to the question , how far can you get a piece of the very far future .
and the <unk> that the <unk> that the island of the island , said , well , we &apos;re going to find it very great .
over here , we &apos;re going to take the whole <unk> , the <unk> of the cable , to sort of the <unk> of the network .
that means if you &apos;re in a age of mile , you can &apos;t do it with no memory .
if you don &apos;t have that , you have to look at this , and you have to replace it with <unk> and <unk> .
we &apos;ve got over 10 million <unk> to <unk> , and we have to <unk> the german web now .
the world &apos;s world , which is going to be , is going to be because you need it to be involved .
so here we see here again , again , again , again , again , the whole <unk> of the world .
then you just use that , what &apos;s sun and wind there is where they live .
but not , we have seven percent and our network is the way we have to see the european .
let &apos;s support , but we don &apos;t think you &apos;re going to solve the problem of the problem .
and that &apos;s what i want to do with you , which i want to take you now .
and of course , if you can &apos;t , you &apos;re going to be in some way .
we just wanted to know what it is , with a regular <unk> , <unk> battery .
we were just at least five people to rebuild a society .
that , we have looking at the largest battery of the world .
it &apos;s not , it &apos;s not , <unk> , we &apos;ve got everything that would never happen .
and if you have a hundred percent of fuel , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
and the title of the talk was , you know , to hundred percent of the time .
i &apos;m also telling you , the politicians , if you put in our facility , you know , in our facility .
by the way , a hundred hundred hundred , the performance is the <unk> of the world &apos;s population in the world .
you can go to a <unk> and get <unk> , and not just <unk> .
we &apos;re cheaper like the <unk> of five times when the average five percent per year .
that &apos;s the only amount of power of a hundred <unk> , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
people always ask me what was going on in <unk> , because it &apos;s in a <unk> ?
it &apos;s you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
the <unk> of the least 10 seconds to keep the net down .
<unk> is just simply , the power station is to keep the frequency .
if you add more <unk> , it &apos;s called the system , it &apos;s beginning to fail .
and in the always three of the time , the two are always going to be <unk> .
the brown is the conventional system , the green system is our system .
if you go to the somewhere , it &apos;s like it &apos;s possible for a while .
i worked in the way that i was working on this .
this is the island of the island , which is the island of <unk> on the <unk> .
so , this is what it sees the load .
there &apos;s going to be a whole lot of <unk> and and .
it comes out of asia , in the case of japan .
and we can do this with this big two milliseconds in the next time .
and you can see what enormous enormous numbers are there .
and the question is , why did you not have more ?
the conventional system looks like this all the world .
and then we started to farm with the <unk> .
we have with dirty , i have new <unk> .
we can also <unk> <unk> <unk> on the web .
now , there &apos;s a lot of studies for now .
now , this is a renewables of 50 percent .
and yes , i &apos;m going to go back again .
and then it looks like this .
our goal was easy to say , okay .
this didn &apos;t even have this one in the world .
and then , a whole lot of simulation .
so , great , then we have a business business .
and that &apos;s the way that the message is the message .
and they can be able to be able to react another .
then we have to put our <unk> capacity in the net .
we have 20 percent in germany .
this was the first century by six years ago .
and here you can see again , again .
we have <unk> <unk> in germany .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
you can put it out of that .
we also have a very data .
how far do you get to be there ?
and then we said , okay ,
it &apos;s simple , it &apos;s going to be .
they &apos;re always saying , &quot;
can &apos;t be a problem .
<unk> is a <unk> .
so , <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
and of course , this is incredibly impressive .
this will be in the next april .
it &apos;s been working with .
there &apos;s a young thousand thousand people .
that &apos;s not a real .
what would be done ?
and here &apos;s the representation .
and they did .
we were 20 people .
this is already .
that &apos;s the system .
that &apos;s fast .
here it is .
this is <unk> .
i recommend all of you to read the wonderful book , or the movie , to be able to understand the wonderful men , which is that not just the music , but how the music that helped make them manage , and how she finally ended up with the instrument , if this is allows the ability to get the <unk> , to get away
many of you will be familiar with this story , because of <unk> &apos;s article , it was a book that was <unk> , with robert <unk> , as a young <unk> , and jamie <unk> as a young <unk> , the <unk> , who was at the <unk> and whose complex thought came through his <unk> .
i had not frightened , not , but i was afraid that i could lose him to be able to be in his universe , and that i could destroy his relationship to the musical , if i started to go across and <unk> other exciting and other exciting forms of <unk> .
he talked about a very <unk> and <unk> <unk> talks about <unk> and hillary and <unk> it never had the only place to create the safe world , and that &apos;s all the <unk> of the first bear of the first violin of the fourth economy .
as a result , he &apos;s particularly susceptible to these these these these these things , and they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and it &apos;s a little bit of the streets of <unk> , always this horror and the <unk> of his own spirit .
by playing music and talking about music , he was from this <unk> , <unk> man who was standing through the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in a professional professional player .
that &apos;s why we make music , why we make something that we &apos;re in all of us , deep inside , deep inside , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity , can shape the reality .
and that &apos;s what we do , and in the same way , the talk is the talk of <unk> <unk> that you can be able to make a long and make solar power , and a little bit together .
i &apos;ve got to mention that number of medicine , because it was been treated to be a medical treatment , and it was been treated with the <unk> and <unk> , which has been treated for a trauma that has been his entire life .
and in just a way , a half <unk> was growing when we were at the first painting in the disney disney hall , we started with disney hall , and he had lost this with his <unk> in his eyes and my own .
and as he took through a miracle , he started to try and get out of a few of the <unk> of play , and then asked me to play , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
don &apos;t say , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for the way out of the sea , that you don &apos;t have the environment . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to keep out with some of the young music or in the south disney hall , or in <unk> , because he &apos;s reminds me about why i was musician .
we started talking talking about music , from beethoven , <unk> , <unk> , and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> .
we came to speak of the subject . and a few days later i got an email , which was that there was a number of interest for me to be involved in me .
and right , i &apos;m just going to just you to just get you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit , and you can also have some sense of it .
well , i &apos;m going to give you some people in the company , and nobody could give me an answer to me , and i finally met the <unk> .
as a ridiculous , the <unk> was <unk> , a day , a day of los angeles , he stopped a wonderful music .
she came from a man , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , who was on a violin , who had only two times .
here was a company trying to solve what this problem was , what was the problem for our phones , how do we grow fish on our <unk> ?
many of them are about it . the environment is most of them , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , let &apos;s take tuna , we &apos;re going to take a great deal .
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out of the waste that waste from our fish , not concentrated . &quot;
no , i &apos;ve actually got out of this fish , from this fish , because i swear to god , the fish for chicken , who &apos;s a chicken for chicken .
it &apos;s the romantic way you learn to the way you know your fish is to know the fish , you know , the fish .
they created a pair of <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , shrimp -- and <unk> , and his company , the <unk> the ecological destruction of the ecological destruction .
seven was a <unk> , and a <unk> and 30 years later , he lived on the streets of <unk> row in the center of los angeles .
and i realized that he was not just a <unk> knowledge about music , but it was also with her also with an extremely personal relationship .
90 percent of the big fish , who we love , the tuna , the <unk> , the <unk> , , they &apos;re collapsed .
and no , he &apos;s not a fish , and he &apos;s not a chef . at least the way you see and i understand it .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that i &apos;m just from my colleagues in the <unk> of los angeles .
the <unk> force of music brought it back into a family of musicians who understand him , his talent and him .
it was like it was under the impact of a invisible scientist , a chemical response , whose favorite was was my play .
one day the boss called the company , and asked if i could get a conference about the farm of the farm .
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
he had just heard a demo of beethoven and fourth symphony , and came up with the stage to imagine .
because the music allows him to him , his thoughts and interact with his imagination and creativity in a real sense .
they built these complicated consequence of <unk> , and they &apos;re the water out of the land and turning out into the river .
he said , &quot; yes , <unk> , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and food .
and while i was playing , i was looking at that in <unk> , a more different change .
i met mr. <unk> in the years ago , two years ago , in the beautiful disney hall .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good , good , <unk> , a <unk> on the menu .
and at that night , i was in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a filter ?
and you really have to get really <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going to be .
he talked about invisible and and and smoke and he wanted to be in the baby .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s the way that i &apos;m going to lead to the fish to try to feed ? &quot;
and the reality is that it &apos;s all and us , and we &apos;re inspired , and we &apos;re inspired by us and the united states .
in the last 50 years , we have the ocean as we &apos;ve beaten by forests .
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
it took about 90 percent of the birds around the place of these birds .
what &apos;s the number of years , so it took him back into a community of friends .
robert : i want to play something that i &apos;ve made a little bit of the <unk> .
better , he was in <unk> , to the main bank of sustainability .
that &apos;s , you know , 15 pounds of <unk> is needed to get a pound .
before the event before the event i called the director of the company company .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what for example , sustainable proteins ? &quot;
<unk> <unk> <unk> turned into understanding a calm curiosity and daughter .
so , probably going to be a <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
so , here was a company who tried to do it right .
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world of a world .
so i called the next day , the event , no one .
instead of using water , they used to the canals to the water again .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you know what , for example , sustainable proteins ? &quot;
i said , &quot; how much of the <unk> is chicken ? &quot;
he came to the table with a bright , almost white color .
who can make a fish like well , after he &apos;s <unk> ?
well , they couldn &apos;t make that , not enough .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent &quot; he said .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> and <unk> .
until the school , the farm was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
and so 1982 has a spanish company with the land .
i &apos;m understood that this is the nature of art .
so you could feel that you could sell him .
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;ll be going to get .
this second fish , this is a different kind of mine .
they were <unk> on what they were in the <unk> .
this first one , this was more like a passionate .
i had this beauty of a relationship over several months .
this <unk> from <unk> to one , he said .
&quot; <unk> to one ? what ? &quot;
i was eating it first in a restaurant in a restaurant .
a <unk> journalist had been talking about a long phase of this fish .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can be .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like this .
so i &apos;ve been able to remind a lot of fish .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . we went .
let &apos;s call him <unk> . actually , he &apos;s called <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of the corner .
they made it by the land .
i was the first sentence of of beethoven .
it &apos;s hard to get the destruction .
he has a <unk> <unk> of 15 .
he &apos;s a biologist at <unk> la <unk> .
it &apos;s near the stream of the river .
so i just started playing .
music is medicine . music changes .
and so he <unk> his <unk> .
am <unk> . thank you . thank you .
&quot; the best in industry . &quot;
sustainable proteins , he said .
in the case of perhaps two percent .
they have the flow of water .
for a farmer , &quot; poor outcomes &quot;
i hope you &apos;re forgive me .
&quot; of course , i said .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
i &apos;m looking at this fish .
still , he was still delicious .
and it was a disaster .
they literally have the <unk> .
i just loved two .
you also don &apos;t do very well .
<unk> , one , great .
let &apos;s call it to either .
it &apos;s really changed to us .
the chef had him .
what a fish .
i wanted to follow them .
let &apos;s call it .
that &apos;s me .
what do they do ?
they were <unk> the canals .
the farm is incredible .
not very sustainable .
thank you .
thank you .
robert recommend .
let &apos;s leave twice .
so if i want to take a thing today , the amount of data that we consume is that the sum of their data , and we &apos;re going to think about it , and i think it &apos;s going to be thinking about how we can use information that we can &apos;t use information that &apos;s going to be pattern and we see that the otherwise have been so
later , i ran on this business with a <unk> , and i said , &quot; well , for a place that i would be like , &quot; for a place that seems to be , &quot; do you have a farm that i &apos;ve ever been in , &quot; how do you success ? &quot;
so not only a farm who doesn &apos;t like their animals , not just a farm that &apos;s their success in your life , but a farm that literally is a <unk> , and not just for those fishes , but for you and me .
bought grain from the ground , <unk> , on the earth , the world , the fish , and all the time , they simply ask , &quot; if we have more people , how awful can we have more people , how awful it can be ? &quot;
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but not through the country , not by pumps , but by fresh water , not by by forests , not through forests and nets , but by the <unk> , but by the sea .
and if you claim that , the future of the good food is somebody somewhere and says , &quot; hey , people know , i love <unk> <unk> , but how are you going to feed the world ?
and then i realized when he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , he <unk> , because the water that &apos;s through this farm , it comes through this flow of flow coming through the river .
now , in the ways that are not so worlds for themselves , the own instead of <unk> , the <unk> , rather than a , farmers , are not only about , but experts for relationships .
it &apos;s a river that leads to all the things that are today today , from the world , to lead , from chemical , , chemical pollution .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and you should do it , because this is how whatever , as , as whatever , is also .
now , if we go back and look at age , we &apos;ll say 40 years or we younger , we see that accidents is actually the definition of people who are concerned about it .
right ? there were us and we were through the korean and i <unk> and <unk> , and i went to my knees , and he &apos;s <unk> in a <unk> .
i don &apos;t have the skin of my loved tank , who was delicious , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i like you don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like you .
well , he goes to me that there &apos;s a lot of system that &apos;s a system that &apos;s the fish , what they would eat in the wild .
and we &apos;re looking at the corner and we have to see the most incredible , thousands and thousands of thousands of <unk> , literally , literally , the size of the brain , as well as it &apos;s .
okay , let &apos;s go to the absolute , a farm that doesn &apos;t take their animals and a farm that &apos;s their success success of their lives .
they &apos;re looking at the horizon that &apos;s a million miles away , and everything you &apos;re seeing are <unk> channels and those density , round up , you know , the <unk> .
we should call them what it is , a living in <unk> , a living , a very <unk> patient to help the very same amount of information .
we can take a step further and take a step back , and we can see that <unk> and cancer are and the usual suspects , but not for everybody .
now , if i want to get a <unk> of a <unk> , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at all the topic of this topic ? &quot;
it &apos;s called <unk> , and what i can do is that i can &apos;t filter the point of a certain kind of <unk> , say , we can say accidents .
and you don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the most <unk> community , the way that we &apos;re going to be in the way .
so i finished him . i said , &quot; <unk> , how come in this room , you tastes so good ? &quot;
i said , &quot; <unk> , isn &apos;t it a good <unk> of the last you want to have on a <unk> ? &quot;
i &apos;m a fan armstrong , so i &apos;m a couple of , so i &apos;m going to show you all the way into the scientific armstrong .
i said , &quot; <unk> , fly , fly to the farm , and fly them to the evening ?
all right . a farm that doesn &apos;t break their fish . a farm that &apos;s success to their success .
and when it turned out to be used , and this is the water &apos;s water , as it is <unk> .
you might say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future to make the future of the future , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in food , is actually good .
so you see that this is going to look at the data and this way in this way of swimming in a <unk> .
now , i like this question , because it &apos;s the logic of our <unk> that has been over the last 50 years .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if you &apos;re the future good food , it will be delicious .
and yet , when i tried to put her in this restaurant in <unk> , they didn &apos;t look at <unk> .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of the <unk> in the distribution , not the <unk> .
he &apos;s a tremendous guy , three pieces of charles , and part of a game to be .
it turns out that <unk> has been the most part of his career in the <unk> national national national park in africa .
no , not , because we &apos;re producing enough to produce the world more than just feeding .
and because of the <unk> , the people are most in the most vulnerable , and they &apos;re on the top side .
what we have here is the <unk> of every single &quot; <unk> &quot; that would ever be made .
now , if i look at the moment , i see the athletes that come in this copy and the <unk> .
and here , here he can see a pattern of mechanical that &apos;s reminds him to the <unk> .
and then it goes and goes into more <unk> of rare birds and the algae and weird <unk> .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the algae , the relationships , is incredible .
the bad ever , the <unk> , the consequences , which is what the fish are .
we love <unk> . we love small <unk> . we &apos;re talking about food food . we &apos;re eating eating .
or better , how can we create the conditions that every community of being able to feed themselves ?
capital , chemistry and machines are at a very good way , and it has never made a really good food .
and my head was a weak part of this piece of <unk> fish that i had at mit .
they &apos;re in a city of a city of miles away , where the <unk> are better for the <unk> .
that was the cause . it was the best . it was the american american agriculture .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better than i will be .
well last year , this has been <unk> birds , more than 250 different species .
he said , &quot; no . you &apos;re doing it because the food is better . &quot;
it &apos;s the greatest private and one of the most important private private private communities .
they &apos;re doing that because they can follow the <unk> white line of the <unk> .
i had a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at <unk> .
he looked at me , as i was just a <unk> of a vehicles .
they were cute and in it , as if you take a living walk from the ocean .
our <unk> is today today not today , not because of <unk> , but because of the <unk> resources .
the moment it was like a religious player had a <unk> .
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no energy . &quot;
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the <unk> for the future .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not mean for content ?
&quot; we lose 20 percent from our fish and <unk> to the birds .
oh , and the way that we should not be there is this <unk> of <unk> .
it &apos;s evolved in the process of evolution to <unk> . &quot;
so , what we see here is a typical <unk> of old .
i asked him how he had become a <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you get your fish ? &quot;
she &apos;s the last first time , before something else in the body .
the program i &apos;m using this is a little experiment .
and the who see <unk> is that this is true .
he said , &quot; fish ? i know nothing about fish .
ever from a farm that doesn &apos;t have their animals ?
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not intense .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re five .
that &apos;s that that &apos;s two billion years of <unk> .
because they are the ones who are also experts for taste .
and i &apos;m going to see another pattern that goes .
you can like to test it in your own .
i was there not a long time with <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
so the same the control the lower system .
he said , &quot; the skin is like a sponge .
the system is so healthy ; it &apos;s the water .
because when the water <unk> , it &apos;s in the atlantic .
but for a lot of people , it &apos;s a little bit .
it &apos;s not a <unk> , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
look at the <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
it &apos;s all right . it &apos;s all online .
it &apos;s great , but i was love .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
every morning they fly to farm a farm .
and every night they would fly to a hundred miles .
i mentioned that to <unk> and he &apos;s <unk> .
let &apos;s take a look at the ecological model .
you can see , you can put in a decade of the .
you can jump directly to a particular copy .
here he does a rare rare <unk> .
now , he mentioned the <unk> of bee .
i &apos;m a expert to relationships . &quot;
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
do you make that for children ? &quot;
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
how are you eating the world ? &quot;
you can do a into a particular year .
<unk> ? i was completely sensitive .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
he &apos;s his head , no .
this is a <unk> network .
one billion people are now becoming a billion .
he showed the behind the algae .
but what &apos;s your fish ?
what is the <unk> ? &quot;
the <unk> gets the shrimp .
the shrimp is eat the humans .
i almost almost never .
i don &apos;t like this question .
you want to feed the world ?
there &apos;s no food .
can i be honest .
they <unk> . &quot;
seriously .
thank you .
i wrote this piece of &quot; the use that the same effects that would be about to be in the visual effects , with shared effects , with the <unk> , were designed by <unk> , &quot; and the <unk> should be all the <unk> . and the world should be <unk> .
and at some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen seen in <unk> , and sometimes things i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that had no one had before , and the science of the time , and the science of the time we saw , they saw no words .
what if we could make that situation and the internet on the head , so that we always take away from one of the things that we could do , and so many things can be done , and so patterns that otherwise could have been hidden ?
and this curiosity also came in , though , when i was not in school , through the forests , <unk> and &quot; samples , &quot; and &quot; samples , frogs and orange and <unk> and <unk> , everything that was left home and under the microscope .
now , when i look at all these people , i think the majority of them are . some of the science come from , some of the most , come out of the economy . so here &apos;s my boss . and one comes from the <unk> .
and if i look back at a step , and i can start to my my , maybe i can start to look at the <unk> , here , and i &apos;m looking for <unk> , or here , or here , or live here , live here .
but here was a world that i actually could actually actually in , on earth , and it was just as fascinating and the stairs as all of the things i &apos;d always been in my books .
so , i &apos;m sitting there , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> , who i know that the <unk> are just kind of , and i know that once the band has played .
something interesting happened to be a <unk> problem in this movie , and we had to solve a problem in this film -- and that &apos;s a kind of liquid <unk> -- we &apos;re going to be able to be <unk> , <unk> .
the film was not a money , right , just he just played his own , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was like that was the magic of the magic that was going on .
<unk> , these app -- i don &apos;t like to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can see this <unk> -- and we put those <unk> on every single website like this .
we actually made a reality later , a reality that i was in a russian <unk> , four miles from the north pole , and i gave the real titanic by a <unk> .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could make an visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was going to see in the front of the world .
and so you get an idea that if you look at this information , you &apos;re <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you &apos;re not looking at it or not just .
and my nose always kept in a book , a book that my thoughts in other worlds and <unk> and in my mind , i mean , <unk> curiosity .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the ocean ocean , in the ocean , as rich as we can &apos;t really imagine it .
after the success of &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker on hollywood , and i &apos;m going to put a <unk> in hollywood .
immediately astronomers came into our homes with his incredible shows that we animals and places and a world full of wonder that we never have before .
i was <unk> my dad , until he finally did a <unk> in the <unk> , new york , was made , just on the other side of the border where we lived .
and it worked . again , we had a magical design , and the effect in the audience was the same thing . we &apos;ve been with the movie , but we &apos;ve already a little more money .
so i started a company , with my good friend , my friend friend who was at the time was the best <unk> and <unk> , and she was called &quot; digital <unk> . &quot;
you go into this argument , you put in this dark , <unk> environment , where there is no hope on rescue , if you don &apos;t turn to the hope for it .
well , after i ask government &apos; government , i realized that the <unk> that most of the year are <unk> at the time .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re just looking at through the same thing , because of the web that &apos;s going to look at the same way , and look at the same way .
but the silence would be quite back . and people in my company told me that we haven &apos;t been able to do that .
you see , we &apos;re watching the online of the web that &apos;s really a really a network , not just on page , but a lot .
and my love of science was to be in my environment , because then in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and the ocean and the sea .
and that &apos;s what we had to do , when we had a book , when we read a book , we took the description of the <unk> and the <unk> them on the screen in our own .
and what happened is something interesting . which is what i &apos;m looking at by east <unk> , which was thought that we were completely seeing the world &apos;s world on our earth .
anyway , the part of the deal with curiosity and science has been . it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was a sense .
and because there was no video games , and this <unk> <unk> , the kind of <unk> in the media , i had to create the pictures in my head .
but in the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the <unk> and <unk> -- we actually did the company -- we actually had a slow way to slow down .
since , in the 40 years , i &apos;ve been <unk> , i &apos;ve spent about three hours of underwater , so i spent a lot of hours of it in <unk> .
so , in a particular , , i can see the kind of this , in the middle of the year , i can go to the people of the year &quot; and everybody together .
of course , the stories i were looking at myself from the <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; hey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the <unk> i saw it as &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship . it became a <unk> <unk> , a classroom .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again , every time it &apos;s bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
that was the best way to tell stories , my inner urge to tell stories , with my own , to make pictures .
together with <unk> , we made the guys out of liquid metal . the success was very <unk> , like this effect would be .
the idea of this company was to start to start the stage , processes to interact with visual systems and to start with the digital <unk> .
the only problem was that i was in a small village in canada , a thousand kilometers from the next ocean .
the ocean , a real ocean , i got only two years later , when we finished california .
i guess i said , by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to get the miserable . we &apos;re going to make the real miserable .
no one had ever explored the inner energy of the world , and you didn &apos;t have the tools for it . so we developed the technology .
my response was actually drawing and painting , aliens , aliens , aliens , robots , and all of this stuff .
from those two experiences , a whole new world was coming , a whole new world of creativity .
what we &apos;ve done here is we have every single <unk> and it &apos;s taken up to a little bit further .
our purpose was , <unk> and the inside of the system , which had never been done before .
it &apos;s something between , and we think it &apos;s the way that information can be used .
this is really important because this is an insight that &apos;s not in a single <unk> .
if we can do that , then it will be able to <unk> this kind of <unk> information , maybe a new source of information .
it was always to try to understand the world and understand the limits of the kinds of art .
certainly , i would never have a alien world with a nuclear spaceship . that seemed to me .
nature doesn &apos;t know the limits of the , very unlike our own , human imagination .
in &quot; <unk> , &quot; i could have my love for the <unk> and the whole thing with the mit .
what was going on , the first <unk> of the first <unk> ever had ever seen in a movie .
sounds crazy . but that &apos;s back to that that can create a reality .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as , as i was in a <unk> .
i went to school with the bus , i went to a dinner , every day .
in the course of the teacher , i was constantly <unk> by the teacher , like i was , in the early textbook , <unk> .
i was in my <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> in the winter in the winter , in the new york .
for that time , i was deepest to see what i see in my view .
according to arthur arthur states , the law is <unk> technology and no longer <unk> .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is what you need to be in the <unk> . &quot;
and then we started to go to the <unk> , and they were doing it with <unk> .
so i want to take this idea now a little bit more about what a little crazy is a little bit crazy .
the apple &apos;s got a quick search and a symbol of the field that it comes from .
and , instead of just taking just in information , we can get out of that .
so we went into &quot; hey 2 , &quot; next film , a lot of even further .
so i went out and made this other film on the big ship , which is .
and the key to the were enormously , we had to build cameras and all kinds of things .
and so , we get a sense about the subjects that are on wikipedia .
and i can sort of all of what i &apos;ve been looking at today , again , again .
right now , in the world , we think that data is a .
and my love to keep the ocean is like , and the same intensity .
it &apos;s just to see if you go a step back and look at the whole thing .
so we can take down and look at all ted ted ted .
and so i want to show you what a little bit of what might be a little surprise .
so i can go back to a specific , and i &apos;m going to jump into a specific <unk> .
here &apos;s the entire demonstration of the entire demonstration that i &apos;ve been doing for .
and if we know , we can actually pull out of it , maybe we can actually pull out of it .
and when i was a job , i was a job , it was the whole thing .
so , there were films of the way , images and stories . that &apos;s how we fit together .
we took small robots that built us to a <unk> .
i &apos;m just thinking of it , but my consciousness is within the legal .
and i can go back to the side of this , and i &apos;ll go back to this .
and so we did , and we also did a thought that we thought of this as a while .
this is hugely important . it &apos;s a good student for marketing marketing . &quot;
and i noticed how much this <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
but even in this broad view , we can do a lot of things .
so i decided to be 15 of the time i was going to be .
and it was a experience that couldn &apos;t give me a bunch of .
and i &apos;m going to fly through a little <unk> through the <unk> of the ship .
i &apos;m going to show you just the new york times website .
so i can zoom in in my my kind of a second .
but i was actually trying to get the true <unk> of the titanic .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
it wasn &apos;t a film , no <unk> , that was really .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> impaired .
so that really got me right , and i wanted to get more .
so i go back to a step of view , and i &apos;m going to see the perspective .
you do something that &apos;s a little bit different .
i &apos;m just showing you the top of the world &apos;s next 500 .
and that &apos;s really good at the <unk> of this .
i &apos;m going to leave the issue .
and interestingly , there &apos;s a ted prize , but it &apos;s a prize .
i grew up with a <unk> science of science .
we &apos;ll be going to show it in the <unk> of the film .
and i &apos;m convinced you to fund a expedition .
and so i met a little unusual decision .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning drowning . &quot;
as a kid , i &apos;d always like the whole thing and so .
i was obsessed with the study of the sea .
we &apos;re talking about the spirit of the <unk> .
so i &apos;m sorry . thank you .
i was completely <unk> , you know .
i could draw . i could paint .
i didn &apos;t have me .
so , my both of my two passions .
so , i really did have a lot of action .
we went back to the 12,000 of the titanic .
the creativity had to go to a kind of .
and i found really fascinating .
so i made this film .
now i see a <unk> <unk> .
so they saw something like that .
this is really cool .
and i was an artist .
if you &apos;re going to go to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the problem , the whole technology , and the difficulty , you know , the human <unk> , &quot; you can &apos;t explain that other people can &apos;t explain . it &apos;s like police or in soldiers that have something in common and know that they never can explain .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of a little bit of a ; they have left zero , and it &apos;s a lot of your number of people , from the number of people , from the number of people , the average energy , which is the average energy for every service and the energy that is going to be a <unk> .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and the real <unk> plan , and in the <unk> and the real <unk> plan . you &apos;re going to go to the mission of the mission of the mission , and then , you know , the international <unk> of the <unk> and take our <unk> .
this was the most powerful form of a <unk> that i &apos;ve ever experienced before , because before i have a corner , i &apos;d know what the same thing was going to be going on in the middle of the classroom , because i was being <unk> in the film .
i took them to the world , and i was giving them access to the world , <unk> , people who were themselves , who used to be used for such extreme situations , and i took them up to the top of these things , and then they could test and take the instruments and then we could test it .
you &apos;re taking to make the challenge of the challenge , and the ocean is the most important environment that there are , you &apos;re doing it , and you &apos;re doing it because of the weird connection of people who are actually creating a team of people .
they <unk> the carbon footprint , which leads to the <unk> , and the <unk> has a very very negative consequences , and the effects of the weather , and perhaps , the <unk> , that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to the order of all the way that they can &apos;t have to be involved and all kinds of systems .
and maybe a little bit of what might happen in some decades , what happened if you have to do something about explore something or to do something , in all sorts of ways , i can imagine , in all of the things that i can do as a <unk> .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could probably make a benefit and less , but in the average , this number will increase every year , and so over the way , over the cost of the services that are per person .
after this expeditions , we started this this crisis , really , really appreciate what we saw in the bottom , for example , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals , these are sort of alien , but here on earth .
and what that surprised is something , because my <unk> research are mostly about boston and vulnerable and the things that we need to do is to make the difference for the world , to make the poorest two billion lives .
in other countries , like the manufacturing manufacturing , it &apos;s published : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> , : <unk> , or <unk> , the <unk> , the vehicle is very much for improvement .
<unk> means that their <unk> are not growing up over many years , and we &apos;re too much or a few <unk> , and things will change how their valuable environment can &apos;t be .
the u.s. <unk> the industrial revolution , and in the 20th century , there was a really hard case in the <unk> , and so we were <unk> , we can make a modern materials , and we can do so many things .
and in this community , you can see the most important thing about the death of the you have before you have a task that you have to be able to explain .
so when i was back to my next film , i was going to go to the same leadership , i was going to take the same leadership , and that you were going to take a team of respect and raise your respect .
if we &apos;re going to deal with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> , we might have to lower 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see a brain population , we see a slope to see .
it &apos;s very different to say , we have a couple of feet on the ground , which is a three feet , and then you can see , you can look at it .
because of different people in the <unk> , through other ways , through new kinds of information , there are many services , which are going to be able to reduce their levels of services , to help 90 percent .
and what they did was to make me this <unk> , that you could use such a <unk> of <unk> and use their own consciousness in the car , in the other form of the existence .
i &apos;ve learned a lot of science , but i think you &apos;re sure , a private thing to be able to have , a leader , like a <unk> , or something like that .
now , the exact result of a <unk> and the <unk> and the way that are more and where they are , there &apos;s some more than a few other things , but not very many .
because we &apos;ve got all of these things to do with 12 to 12 people , and we have on the way we &apos;ve got two to three months to go to sea sea .
so i was there with a little team of <unk> terrain , and we &apos;re constantly <unk> with a new technology that has never been there .
that &apos;s the thought i &apos;d like to give you to the way , is a sense of an alternative , but it &apos;s not a . thank you .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s get the price -- we meet the price of a new new and this fish has gone down with co2 .
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this is a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that per average is going to be <unk> per capita .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;re now going to be able to get 26 billion to maybe 13 billion tons of tons . and that &apos;s just simply not enough .
all of the thinking i was between &quot; titanic and &quot; &quot; the &quot; , &quot; and i have to come to the nails on a big screen on the beach on the beach .
the other one you can do . don &apos;t take you yourself , don &apos;t take yourself against yourself . but take risks on you . &quot;
for me , it was more a more <unk> way to do my job , the actual process that has changed in the effect .
the fact is that if you could reduce one price of one thing , the energy would be used to be more likely to be more likely to be on the most effective .
only a different economic change have been influenced by all the time , and we need to increase from <unk> increase and to a increase to zero .
to me , young filmmaker who say , &quot; give me a advice to how i can do this . &quot;
but energy and climate is extremely important for these people , actually , actually , more important than anyone on the planet .
so , total , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may be able to be a factor of a factor of a factor or maybe a factor of sixth .
so the circle of my existence is as a child , as a child , and the ability to change .
there were people who said , we would have this <unk> <unk> , and we were <unk> on the planet .
so here we have a very serious service . there &apos;s a very basic service to be able to read the homework ?
the idea was really tangible for them , you know , there &apos;s people who live with mosquitoes .
and so you can see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees , that they can survive .
at the same time , i was very interested in <unk> , that was the time of my childhood .
but in art , in the art , to failure , is an alternative , because it &apos;s a <unk> .
and there are certain things about how bad they are , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad .
and that &apos;s very good things , and it &apos;s a very good things to make any of the drugs on the planet .
you &apos;ve got to tell me that they don &apos;t bite , actually , you don &apos;t even leave the glass .
so let &apos;s look at every factor of the time , and we think of how we get that on zero .
and these students don &apos;t go , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
well , in the case of efficiency , the energy , the energy per service , there is a good news .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
but the end of the time , it was clear that i was going to take a look at the deep sea .
i remembered last year when i brought mosquitoes to me , and i kind of like the people that i did .
because at a point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do ?
i asked the most amazing times , &quot; do we really have to get down to close to zero ?
it &apos;s all that we eat , the food we eat , clothing , <unk> .
and usually , there &apos;s no way you need a miracle to a certain laptop .
in this case , we have to give ourselves and give a miracle in a very short time .
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration of the demonstration of people that are here ?
i decided that the tail of <unk> my <unk> contribution to the environment .
it felt like i was living in the <unk> of the titanic .
i made all these films , this is a very small audience .
the answer is : until we get close to the end , the temperature goes down .
well , we &apos;re going to do a lot of <unk> , which is a lot of <unk> .
almost every <unk> for electricity today , except the renewables and <unk> .
now , if i use the word , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
they don &apos;t exist in a very sunlight of the same design as we do .
we &apos;ve got this , but actually , but actually , in fact , <unk> .
that leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to the creation .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation in the world , we &apos;re in the world .
every americans about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
and it &apos;s on nine billion <unk> that are going to be on nine billion to nine billion .
i don &apos;t know much about leadership , and i have this expeditions to be a profound .
no reference , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?
and we were going to be a period of four years of a family .
nasa has a <unk> , &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
no major organization , the innovation was , without risk .
co2 is the co2 and the equation for co2 , and it &apos;s actually quite clear .
it &apos;s the question if you can get that up .
we &apos;re just playing the animal . from , not a <unk> .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and the whole of the family is more important than all the world &apos;s world .
it &apos;s about five tons of the world &apos;s population on the planet .
and somehow we have to bring changes the way that we &apos;re going to do that on zero .
now this is basic algebra , but we do do it .
you &apos;re usually just about the same thing , and some of you don &apos;t .
now , i wonder , how can i really get this ?
the set was a complete copy of the mechanism of the ship .
so , it &apos;s changed my way to make films , completely .
you have to be ready to take risks .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
people here have been able to get this miracle in this wonder .
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t take you yourself .
probably one of those numbers has to be very close to zero .
the second factor is the services we use .
over the course of this , i &apos;ve learned a lot of learned .
i think first is the curiosity .
today i &apos;m talking about energy and climate .
so , will be a infinite terrible case for you .
well , the <unk> is over time .
this is a lot of time , at zero .
these <unk> films don &apos;t bring us to us .
there &apos;s a connection , a second respect .
so what can we close to all of that ?
and the other thing is , the <unk> is very important .
isn &apos;t half the time or a quarter ? &quot;
it &apos;s great that this number is .
the internet and the services is a miracle .
so this was a very complex experience .
we have something that is not .
for energy , i think it &apos;s a .
so here &apos;s a couple of natural light .
they &apos;re <unk> by <unk> .
it was really the dynamic .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
in fact , the <unk> is based on <unk> .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn gas , no .
what lessons have we learned ?
it &apos;s more <unk> .
first , we have the population .
today , <unk> billion people have .
it was really pretty profound .
that was fascinating .
it &apos;s a challenge .
we need <unk> .
incredibly exciting .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve made all kinds of batteries that are made , and for everything , <unk> , for everything , and that i &apos;ve done with the amount of energy that the world uses , which uses the world , i think , is that all the batteries that we produce now , in the use of the batteries that we can now do now , less than 10 minutes of dna .
and so , the beauty of it , but the beauty is a million times a million times a lot of energy , and so , if you can deal with the problems and you &apos;re mostly , you can deal with the problems , and the cost of the cost , the potential , the potential , the potential , the potential , the implications of the country and other things , almost in a own own .
<unk> : well we haven &apos;t got a place on the ground , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting things that we &apos;re wearing &quot; nuclear &quot; on the name of the country , india , in china , china , china -- china -- i was here , and i &apos;ve met the <unk> and talked about how this is going to be like this .
bill gates : to get the simulation of a life , all the major scientists , we &apos;ve got to have all of the things we &apos;ve done , and even if we have our materials in a russian reactor , to make sure it &apos;s rational , it &apos;s just in the <unk> million .
there are some <unk> that that are going to do this at a 60 percent -- 80 percent , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get it to get a lot of the co2 to the co2 , but a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
this one might take a more and do it , and if you &apos;re willing to do better , but my brother is that we have to work at all five of those five , and we can &apos;t give them any of them because because all of us are because of the problems .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it , but you could have to even even if it was going to be able to be able to see it , but since there &apos;s modern , you can see it , and you can see it &apos;s really , right !
so there &apos;s a big opportunity here . there &apos;s challenges with the transmission . if we say , the power of the country is not just the country &apos;s country , you don &apos;t just need the technology ; it &apos;s also going to be the power of where the energy comes from .
what you do to do , may be simple , but it &apos;s not . you need to go out of the co2 that will burn from the <unk> , you know , <unk> , and then you get to get in , and then you get that there .
it &apos;s also three big problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries are high . the question for security that you really feel nothing wrong , despite the human lives , the human life , the fuel is not used for the fuel .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love to choose , or i could choose this desire , which is the <unk> , <unk> , that i &apos;m going to take a wish that i &apos;m going to take a vaccine .
<unk> : right . now you have to have the reactor , so there &apos;s a lot of people and there &apos;s lots of people who can go wrong , and there &apos;s lots of people who can go wrong . this thing is not good .
we need solutions , either one or several of the have a broken scale and the lifestyle of the have been able to look for people out of that , and even though there are many ways that people can do that .
but actually , the grade for the things we &apos;re not to do is not to go to the great <unk> , just like , or even even less important as the other , the the speed of innovation for this major part .
if we don &apos;t get to get this desire , it will be terrible between space and imagination , people are terrible , between the united states and china , between poor and china , and nearly all of life , is a lot of worse .
<unk> : yeah . well , what happens to the waste is that you can sit it , there &apos;s much less waste of this -- there &apos;s a lot of waste out there -- and then you put it into the next reactor and you &apos;ll burn it .
<unk> : if you come into that situation , it &apos;s like you &apos;re too much , and you &apos;re going to be a heart of a heart attack , and what do you do ? you need a <unk> or something like that .
to understand that , in order to build this , it means that deep deep nuclear nuclear means , that the <unk> , and then it starts going to start up and then start over the process , and it goes on and then it goes down and continue to go down ?
this is a very important step , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor , and some countries have built this , so that anyone who has broken a rapid arm , a <unk> for our first .
once the first piece is , if he promised like the , it &apos;s all right , because the real one is the one that is in the way that we know it .
the other note that says we &apos;re using the technology technology , whether they have been used in all the developed developed countries , and we &apos;re in the way that they &apos;re going to get them to the rest of it .
and luckily , today , today of companies , and we need hundreds of people who are , as well as the function of their work , the energy for their pilots , for their pilots .
there &apos;s a <unk> called <unk> , which is different from different techniques to the warming , and so we have 20 years longer to make us go back to us .
the <unk> system is that instead of a part of the <unk> , one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
we should use the <unk> to the emissions to get emissions in the way , less than the less we can be <unk> , the lower temperature , and so it &apos;s also the temperature .
but if you have a lot of fuel fuel , you can do it for 60 years -- think about a column -- you think about it , without the whole .
so , you have to have to have , if you have to have the sources , you have a way to get the energy in times , and when you &apos;re not available .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s a example of many of many of the hundreds of different kinds we need to get .
and we start by taking the waste that &apos;s already already in these <unk> or <unk> , which is the <unk> , that we &apos;re in the reactors .
so that &apos;s what these reactors have a problem , what we put in our own and so that the <unk> will be used as the process .
<unk> : now we &apos;re going to have one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , and we have 20 years to invent it , and then 20 years to use .
who can do something , which is , many billion times more than any kind of waste you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
the rest of 20 percent are going to be made in the poor countries , and even more agriculture , and hopefully even slow and <unk> and <unk> .
they really do it by creating a framework where they &apos;re going to be able to be blind , because we need to support support all of the pages .
the difficult step is to find the first of the first to find another billions of billions of times the site , and the place that are actually the first one .
this is the waste that 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s clearly in the field of which it &apos;s called <unk> uranium .
you know , we know we don &apos;t know their work as well as these , but there &apos;s a little bit of the way that &apos;s different .
so we need a great breakthrough to do something that is going to be a factor of 100 times as the time .
this is what we &apos;ve been in this industry before , a few time ago , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts .
thank you so much . just to understand the way you know -- how do you give us a sense of the scale of this investment ?
and , you know , <unk> , when everything is going to be good , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could be easy to keep .
the sun doesn &apos;t have all the day , and it doesn &apos;t always look every day every day and the wind is not constantly constantly .
this is what happens when you try to do these <unk> sources over 20 percent , and we &apos;re going to do 20 percent of the stuff .
so , to do this 80 percent , to the united states , including the countries like china , their <unk> , their own <unk> .
they should be <unk> and they would be shocked by the ridiculous of the ridiculous rule that they could be spent for these innovative .
the al gore &apos;s book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david <unk> &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and also , though , though it &apos;s amazing , it &apos;s great that they need a fuel -- they have some of the first .
<unk> <unk> invest in a couple of times , the great things are doing and interesting things , and i &apos;m trying to support that .
we &apos;ve got to see these wonder and we can measure it , and we can measure it in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
and if you get <unk> and just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of life .
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to reach , and then we talk about the <unk> .
so three of very difficult problems that might be be , and that &apos;s where you work on that .
in fact , you get the waste , and you can actually use the waste of 50 to the <unk> .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of a column often , as &quot; humanity wave <unk> &quot;
we need <unk> , carbon dioxide , <unk> , <unk> &amp; amp ; d , that a <unk> .
we have to go dialogue and put it on the way that we have to do , and the things that are going to be done by government government .
and it would be best if it &apos;s going to be multiple , because then you could use a meter .
there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , which seems to be hard , but maybe the way that we &apos;re talking about .
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many <unk> , the oil power is more than a normal power power .
i think there are many things in the ted group , there are many things that are already there .
anywhere &apos;s &quot; and i fund a company , which perhaps , perhaps , the nuclear approach .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have been doing something in the direction .
this is just the fact that we have the <unk> that we have to go .
it would be that without the <unk> , but it &apos;s a lot more important .
well , there are all kinds of things like this , but they all not all of them .
let &apos;s first look at the burning fossil fossil fossil , either by either natural gas or natural gas .
one is the absolute ones that produce these technologies are lower than the <unk> of the <unk> .
instead of break it into this head , they burn it . a great thing .
if countries are meeting in places like <unk> , they don &apos;t just talk about co2 .
if you want to be 100 percent on this , you need an incredible amount of <unk> .
bill gross has a lot of companies , a lot of other people called the great <unk> .
and because you have this 99 percent of the time , the <unk> is much better .
it &apos;s a very important wish , but i think we can make it .
and it &apos;s sitting there and 60 60 years , and it &apos;s finished .
in their idea , the time , the time , and what is the way to do that ?
what &apos;s the most important thing that &apos;s most important about this is that the biggest thing you know ?
do we have to be able to keep ourselves out of the <unk> stable stable ?
because even though it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of things .
in many , you &apos;ll say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
but as you &apos;ve been talking with different people of these world , you &apos;ve been talking about these options .
so , where should we go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
what we need is many companies working on this .
if we go back to the way that should be the 2020 ?
it &apos;s the renewables , as they &apos;re often called .
it &apos;s not possible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
a &quot; promise project ? how do we get to the target ?
the uranium is used in terms of a rather like a candle .
a <unk> , which is a solution to the garbage .
i have , i have , <unk> , <unk> , and it &apos;s organic .
in every one of these five areas , we need to have 100 people .
there are some of the innovations in <unk> ; <unk> , <unk> .
let &apos;s face how we should measure our success .
it &apos;s really very important that we get there .
a very simple wish that we invent this technology .
where is the biggest interest in which it &apos;s really what &apos;s really ?
this is a different of one thing that made it .
the u.s. government <unk> the u.s. for hundreds of years .
many of them are from one percent percent by 2050 .
and what do you do with the waste ?
the last three of five i &apos;ve been doing .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
there are many great books that have been on this subject .
in nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
it should be the two elements of the elements .
there &apos;s some of the things that have to do .
we need to use ourselves for more useful .
anyway , we need a solution .
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important thing .
if you don &apos;t work , what then ?
so that &apos;s a tough thing .
so , this is a pretty crazy idea .
this is a health of this <unk> .
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
and also , these sources are able to be .
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
this really really does the <unk> .
how should we look look at our owns ?
this has the biggest effect .
so what do we need to do ?
for what i do for me ?
we have to spread the message .
who will make it ?
next : <unk> .
that &apos;s great .
this is a wish .
thank you . thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
and that &apos;s why you have to do all kinds of problems , you know , that you have only done a lot of the <unk> , and it &apos;s not that the isn &apos;t really the idea of the world , not necessarily the worst thing , and there are people in the world who look at and say , okay , that &apos;s not a big animal .
and that would be their answer to the <unk> argument that , if you use all of time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals , suffer , the other goals , the <unk> , the ones that are , that there &apos;s a dumb of resources to invest money , while there are better things that we can do .
but my dream here is that if you can do it , the footprint , the same footprint , say , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t care that it &apos;s not interested in that , there &apos;s no co2 , i wish it was not a co2 , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you &apos;re going to look at the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a research in a way that you should have to have this way , if things get to get , if you have to get the same time , or that innovation needs longer than we expect .
since i &apos;ve been doing 70 of the world worldwide , with students , with the , and architects , even with the <unk> of the <unk> , and there &apos;s something that &apos;s going to be done in the nature of collaboration in collaboration with collaboration .
you get to look at the great <unk> , and there &apos;s a random people , if you have something that is not economic , and trying to fund that , for me , is most of the waste .
what &apos;s more different is that they start to start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , and they build , successful prototypes , and the top of the top , they have to repair the possibility of <unk> prototypes .
and finally , before you don &apos;t have any time , you have no time to take the marshmallow and you put it on the top , you put a step back and you put it back , &quot; <unk> , &quot; do you want to work .
but then , almost , it &apos;s happening , that the &quot; <unk> &quot; is &quot; because the weight of the weight that the whole thing is the whole thing and <unk> .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re very short before a <unk> and funded only one , and i think we should try to do more things that the potential of the potential to be very much less .
it &apos;s not that we all use our senses to the task , and that we should use our thinking of how our feelings and our feelings are in the challenge that we &apos;re .
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t be just working on the party , because it &apos;s a little bit of <unk> , so you can eat it because you know that you &apos;re going to save the <unk> .
he &apos;s still going to be because of his former stories , but he &apos;s got to understand that this is a very depression , and he &apos;s going to be a very wealthy group , and so he does now the <unk> .
<unk> : well , the actual spending for research -- say , we should say the u.s. military should spend 10 billion a year than they &apos;re doing -- that &apos;s not that dramatic .
and i wonder what they would choose , because i &apos;ve been asking my friends in time , and they wanted to go to the past .
this is the most important time that you have ever been on this planet , health , , which makes a difference , economic , economic , , opportunities , the <unk> .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking to almost all the people here , when i say , i really hope that your wish is true . thank you very much .
the average average for most of it is about <unk> , <unk> half half of them , lawyers , but not much more , more than adults than adults .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything it needs to be us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to get a &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . it &apos;s got to be the area of the very large structure of the 20 , about about tape , about a hundred and a marshmallow .
the reason is , i &apos;m creating digital tools and processes to help teams , to help teams , video games and design .
a child who &apos;s born in a minute can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world &apos;s world .
there are a set of people who have much more &quot; <unk> &quot; than others , and under the worst , are more <unk> .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to time before there was cars or twitter or twitter , or &quot; america . &quot;
there are very , very few things that you can even say , that there are a chance of opportunity to be in a million .
and of course , there &apos;s also teams that have been a lot more &quot; <unk> &quot; and the best are <unk> for the best of the <unk> .
and you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay here and stay here .
i mean , everybody of us here would have five times as much for our energy without changing .
and , although it really seems to be really , it &apos;s really hard to do because it &apos;s really very fast .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you have no time to put and what &apos;s going on ?
so , the capacity to work with prototypes , is to see how different teams are going to be .
do you say there &apos;s negative effects that have to do with the clouds that are things ?
if you get a lot of the you get , a very high <unk> , then you can only get the rich .
a few years ago , at ted , he named peter <unk> a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i put it into a <unk> .
as peter , we don &apos;t just produce the highest towers , but also the most useful structures of all .
and why ? because they &apos;re also both understanding and <unk> patterns , the key to build structures .
if you have 10 teams , you have to have a little bit of the <unk> , you have to have the extra structures .
and peter is , &quot; none of the children can be in the <unk> of the <unk> .
and the team that &apos;s taking up and the work is going to improve the power of the whole world .
the challenge for a shared experience , a common language language , <unk> , the right prototype .
but it &apos;s not just people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
then they &apos;re spending a little bit of time in planning and organization . they &apos;re eating and they &apos;re eating .
what might you be asking : how is it coming ? why ? what about those ?
<unk> : do you have a or two sentences for those to you to convince you ?
you talk about it , you know , it &apos;s going to be like you &apos;re going to do it .
and that is that , in fact , <unk> training , that we have a real plan , ok !
it &apos;s incredible . you see around and see &quot; this team will be winning . &quot;
if someone had built a <unk> , a lot of construction , he &apos;d have the prize to home .
and the most important lesson , i think , is actually a sport of a sport .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and not because i &apos;m an engineer .
it &apos;s because opportunities don &apos;t go back to this planet , they go forward .
his new <unk> is now , &quot; why is the research that i &apos;m not going to be ? &quot;
there are <unk> lessons for us to create that nature and succeed .
you find crazy examples of all the world , how people make the system and the <unk> .
a big machine , a cool machine , and that &apos;s a long machine .
they lie , they &apos;re confused , they &apos;re really confused and produce <unk> .
and with each trial , the kids get immediate feedback and what doesn &apos;t .
you like , why would somebody actually spend a chance of making a difference ?
and what &apos;s the most amazing thing is , you &apos;re going to follow them to follow them .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the <unk> .
i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re kind of to be part of the way that &apos;s going to be too <unk> .
so i want to go into that machine , and i want to go to the future .
you make the mistake now , and you get a lot of later .
research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little bit of the research is going to be .
you get a <unk> green green service on the team , you &apos;re going to get better .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high energy have a strong effect ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , unfortunately , the fact in very different places .
usually , most people , they usually start to be in the task .
so i offered a $ prize prize for the winners for the winners .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in it can be <unk> .
smallpox smallpox . smallpox have billions of people on this planet .
the fact is that these uncertainty should be worried .
and that &apos;s a set of me to do that for an appropriate .
they &apos;re spending a lot of their time in the <unk> all the time .
<unk> is the way that we &apos;re doing this collaboration as a core of the <unk> .
so , we &apos;re about to be a bit about average . but here &apos;s interesting .
this was happened . not a team had a structure in a structure .
so , the same , bad team of one of the best .
so , there &apos;s better one nine nine to the beginning of my <unk> .
those of the people who are doing scientific arguments are very little .
but for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
the skills and <unk> and <unk> and their combination of success .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
i &apos;m not part of that group , i have to say .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
the same thing is that it &apos;s similar to aids .
it &apos;s the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
now they were doing the advantage of the &quot; prototyping &quot; .
they produced the highest construction in the entire time .
let &apos;s do this as we have a machine .
we hope we don &apos;t need to do that .
you can predict that . why is this ?
they &apos;re the process , they understand it .
i thought we would bring the <unk> .
there was never been a time of time .
my my <unk> died were all the way they were 60 .
my parents are the 80 times in the world .
there &apos;s another reason for me .
because they have special skills of the <unk> .
what would you think about this ?
we took this exercise with the same students .
and that can make a great difference .
and everybody in this room has to be in .
there are other things that suffer other things .
the marshmallow need to be up on the marshmallow .
they don &apos;t spend time in <unk> .
and architects and engineers , luckily .
my grandparents are actually taking the number of times .
this is just a <unk> .
and even <unk> thinking about it .
it was a huge success .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
and then it was to go .
so i tried to do something .
what do you think was happening ?
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
and why is that ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
who is the most successful ?
what was the result ?
there are also <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i understand .
<unk> : thank you .
i don &apos;t know .
thank you .
we &apos;re at the threshold of amazing , amazing events on many of the places , and yet i think we &apos;ve had hundreds of 300 years to have the time to find a time in which we have in progress , which we have in the very few <unk> , more more than now .
so i also wrote a article written about , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought , &quot; <unk> , &quot; why thought that molecules were going to be a random form of a certain form of a <unk> that was nature .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because we believe we believe what we see in the way we see what causes us to see .
but because that &apos;s not what it happened , we can do it and people like jenny and people like jenny <unk> , and i &apos;m afraid of all of these things like , and i &apos;m king king king .
and from my view of the scientific method , things , if it works , it will change it , if it doesn &apos;t , one of the great achievement of human human .
well , that &apos;s good , besides that paul , and the talks is how valuable you are talking about , and that people are just to stop .
but this is me at the awake -- one of the things that i think at night , and we &apos;ve never had science progress , never as never , like now , never .
and i can say that we &apos;re now now in a epidemic of fear , as i never saw , and hopefully never see it .
we have the trust in institutions , in private , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why not to be that should be .
the data came from the u.s. , from england , from sweden , from sweden , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection .
water , <unk> land , , <unk> , oil , gas , they disappear , and that &apos;s not a matter of the chaos , we &apos;re going to go out of this chaos .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people , without the country that they live in .
and i was really afraid to turn resistance to resistance , to resistance , which is the most successful health care in the health of human life .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe maybe today &apos;s morning in lagos , and they fly in a plane , and fly to los angeles , right now , he &apos;s talking about .
and he goes in a couple hours , and he &apos;s going to put a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to go to a long beach that &apos;s going to be visit tonight .
about 12 years ago , a story published published , a horrible story that was the <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> &apos;s very close to her .
we don &apos;t think about a bunch of documents that we &apos;re going to do , and i understand that data is all about , and i understand that , i think we &apos;re all doing .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know , because the world is now going to be .
you take the stuff , and you use alternative , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference , how often we find that they &apos;re useless .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i did just what i was doing , and i wrote a article and i went .
there are questions and problems with people who we thought they &apos;d always have right .
and so , for the fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the world is going to be <unk> .
now , that &apos;s all the good news , because there &apos;s a couple of other problems , and they &apos;ve been found .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people in this world every day .
but now , here &apos;s the evidence that you have to take , you know , that evidence is , and we &apos;re not good at that .
he gets calls to his home , because people like to tell people where they can go to school .
and that &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon will be children , because that &apos;s just one question of numbers .
in the rich world , the millions of people have to have a few of us are still threatened .
and i was a article about a decade ago , &quot; the new york &quot; wrote a little article .
but i was worried that i was worried , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i found it .
one of me wrote a <unk> from me a couple of weeks ago , and i said i &apos;m a little bit to <unk> .
that &apos;s the planet that we live . don &apos;t you like it .
and we &apos;ve never been able to do it , it &apos;s like to do it , we can &apos;t do it .
and listen , everybody &apos;s a right to his opinion , even a very , very sense of his opinion .
they have the demographics of the earth in a way , like no war has ever done for a war .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are the people of the scientific method .
people are in their faith , and they &apos;re so noisy that you can &apos;t get it free .
we &apos;re a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship with progress , like used to be used .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept going to go .
and that &apos;s because of that , that was that i &apos;d never have me out of all the time .
you don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same .
i know that you &apos;ve done this because half of americans who are every day .
and not only that , we have to do our imagination to be able to think of this world .
okay , so there &apos;s reasons for reasons that i think we know what &apos;s going to be .
take them , let &apos;s go back to the diseases , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s just happening .
i think we can &apos;t have this world with energy energy that they don &apos;t even go back .
in this country , not at all , but in fact , the world &apos;s been last year .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing and <unk> and <unk> ourselves to us that .
they don &apos;t have a right to your own facts . &apos; <unk> , don &apos;t have it .
it can save the life of <unk> , giving children a year in the developing countries .
if paul comes in a public school , he can &apos;t tell you no <unk> .
that number is going to be very fast , and it &apos;s a very fast , and that &apos;s a second .
we &apos;re still , we &apos;re going to go , we go , that &apos;s okay .
so , the <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , weapons , the <unk> 2000 .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and that &apos;s very fast .
that &apos;s all you want to take for 28 billion dollars for the lower number .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
we &apos;re talking about this , with a little bit of a little , we &apos;re doing this .
and they can do that because they connect cause and correlation .
we love it , we love to focus in lie . we love that .
we hate a too strong government . we don &apos;t have a trust into the system .
i think this is , and no , that &apos;s not a <unk> .
but then i thought , you know , what we &apos;re honest .
you can just call a names of names and people .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
she wouldn &apos;t be able to get your kid against <unk> .
why ? because we don &apos;t have a <unk> . and you know what ?
<unk> , a little bit of a little <unk> that helps you on the top .
well , i think i think we hate the drug .
and soon i wrote a article about the way we had a article .
ask asking , demand , ask , you have to demand .
there &apos;s been a lot of studies in the way that this was true .
we have been able to do that , and it &apos;s a serious thing .
does one ever die in the audience of dying of dying .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , disappeared , disappeared .
he just developed a couple of other people &apos;s lives .
what about <unk> ? do we take that . why not ?
and we shouldn &apos;t be that , our healthcare system is free .
and i took a while for trying to figure out .
these were <unk> people , people , people , people .
these are many deaths by trial , 20 an hour .
he &apos;s <unk> by one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are essential .
they &apos;re doing their manual . more than never do it .
so we run away , and where are we going to go ?
but you know , you don &apos;t know what ?
they were just like people in this room .
what happened is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do that .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
does anybody even know what this is ?
this is <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
this guy was a hero , <unk> <unk> .
the guy in the middle of that is not so much .
and they will not only die of dying .
we didn &apos;t have a <unk> in this country .
did you have all their brothers ?
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
not even the truth is going to free .
we now have done this in this country now .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
we walk into the arms of the <unk> .
we have them <unk> .
so that &apos;s the good news .
the same thing , just bigger .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
and that brought me so ... ...
don &apos;t take any of them .
and that &apos;s what he says .
nobody one ever said that before .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
the result of that was .
because anybody did ?
so paul is a very popular .
the data is all going to .
i agree with it .
people were playing <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about it .
the data came in .
but you know what ?
not very often very often .
he called paul <unk> .
pretty good , not ?
dark . dark .
it &apos;s horrible .
very frightening .
wonderful .
in other words , <unk> have been given a very important effect , the <unk> , and it &apos;s just because the person thinks what happens with her is a <unk> or a kind of ... in the <unk> , for example , is there , if the patient &apos;s only enough to believe a lot of meaning in the body that you call the <unk>
and now you might talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t see that there are only three fingers here : because the mind and the way it &apos;s eating information , it doesn &apos;t make them look like one , one , two , but it &apos;s a group .
for a while , i &apos;m interested in the <unk> . it &apos;s odd to be a magician for a matter of which , because , you look at it as a deception that &apos;s going to be a little bit more than a deception that &apos;s going to be something that &apos;s going to be . &quot;
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their job because we fear is a real woman , and they &apos;re millions of people from the ground .
now , when i was in the hand , i &apos;m going to see my hand from you , so you can see it &apos;s moving here , my finger here , just from where he was able to be , in a position where he &apos;s so <unk> .
now , this is a trick that i often often kids kids who are interested in for magic , because you can learn a lot about deception , if you can get out of a very closely point , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
because i don &apos;t care about whether it &apos;s the <unk> , who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to be the evidence of my experts , &quot; or any <unk> , who wants to treat his patients with <unk> .
he brought his people to to it , because he was paying that red <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> much more effective than a drug , we know that they can also be the the of aids .
now we can do more and more . and of course , there are risks . but we can do something like the three in rice , and that can help millions of people , millions of people , to their lives .
and it &apos;s what it turns out , if you &apos;re a <unk> in shape , a white camera , in the form of a <unk> , that &apos;s just a round , white waiting that has a certain case .
but if you have the shape of the , you can change , for example , in a smaller sense , and this blue color and a letters on it , and it &apos;s a letter that &apos;s actually literally more efficient .
none of them -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , because i don &apos;t even know what &apos;s going on , but we give billions of dollars for it , it &apos;s like .
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do so as we do , we &apos;re going to be guilty of something we think , i don &apos;t want to be guilty , i think , in the same way .
and guess what ? when i say that , people are saying people , and say , &quot; what do you do ? &quot; people are doing what they want .
we need to lead this conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into the time and the future we will be happy to do that .
now what i &apos;m saying is : to many chemicals , these are the same , , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to be a huge fields with one thing , which is wrong .
it &apos;s not about <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s about getting people who are living in the world , and it &apos;s going to be time to understand what it means .
if you go to that way , where belief and magic and magic , they &apos;re getting to a place where they don &apos;t want to be .
and you can see , in no time , no time , i &apos;m going to go through this time , and as i &apos;m here , you can &apos;t go into my own or go .
of course , it &apos;s going to be <unk> , but not through the meaning of my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing , by the way , by which i &apos;m going to get through this movement , it &apos;s moving back to the beginning of the time .
now , the most <unk> epidemic that we &apos;re right in , this is this battle battle between the <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
so after this incredibly funny entertainment , you want to say , &quot; do you want to take in this ridiculous and look into the future ? &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that has at least for the 1950s in every single day .
i say , i &apos;m going to <unk> my wife to make sure that nothing in my mind or my mind , and that &apos;s a lie .
a single day is not a single day as three replicate -- i don &apos;t remember the very already , i &apos;m sorry .
but you know , that &apos;s really a serious thing , because the stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars for this .
and to make sure that nothing in my mind is going to be out of my mind , or it &apos;s going to be my right now , i &apos;m just going to put my fingers right here .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything is going to be the knife , the teeth through my husband &apos;s intuitive .
you know , in the next 50 years , we will have 70 percent more food than it is to be more than 70 percent .
i know we can do it , and as far as it takes me , it &apos;s something that needs to be .
everything we eat , every single <unk> , every <unk> , every <unk> , has been changed by people .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our suffering on the planet , food food food food food .
we can get them out where we want them to <unk> them , and we will move them to where we want to go .
a general event , which is at a end of the end , and the other red is , is better than a little white .
it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s our not paying , and we need to do this .
it &apos;s actually a place that i &apos;m holding in your place , and it &apos;s not a little bit like the knife .
the reason i &apos;m putting my wife is that it &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a couple of <unk> substance of a substance that you &apos;re a patient .
it doesn &apos;t have a nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have any protein , and scientists are building all this stuff .
so we &apos;re going to understand each other , i &apos;m going to show you a basic , very simple trick .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> in a country that &apos;s worse than any other one of this disease .
nothing else in my mind or comes out , not a <unk> . and you can see everything that &apos;s going on .
a year or so , i read a study that really had me really quite a study .
we don &apos;t encourage people to encourage this stuff , like , for example , for example .
but that &apos;s not what i &apos;m not here , and then i open my hand .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researcher , and so i was so passionate .
the knife , you can study them ; my hand , you can see .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge amount of plastic , but it &apos;s not science .
it would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and all of that , i can say , why is we stop doing that ?
right now , you &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
i &apos;ve learned it from the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> in the 1970s .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to move to your needle .
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
and , even though it &apos;s not any of any <unk> -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
if you take a little bit more than each other , the ones are more effective .
don &apos;t tell me that these things have no consequences .
and then people could eat the food and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
it &apos;s a deception being made to something that is happening to us .
but a white ball is not as good as a blue .
it turned out that that &apos;s not all that .
and you know what my answer is all of this ?
it &apos;s not an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
i mean , why do we fight this , why do we fight ?
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s going on .
we can put this up on everything we want .
and when i &apos;m <unk> , the finger is the position of its position .
i take that hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
so , you can give her , you can teach your friends and neighbors . thank you .
there was no <unk> . we did this .
you need that , and we give them a lot of them .
it &apos;s something that is going to eat a billion people .
it &apos;s just a little bit . it &apos;s essential .
anyway . so i want to be sure .
i &apos;m going to explain you for you and then explain him .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain him .
i &apos;m going to be able to do my knife as i &apos;m going to be .
probably many of you here have this trick in the room .
now , what does it do to do with the <unk> ?
this is an <unk> debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphor .
you know , there was no <unk> in the paradise .
we &apos;ve done it in the last six years .
yeah , you &apos;re right . we did this .
you know , science is not a company .
this investment investment in africa has been in africa .
they wouldn &apos;t be the way they know ?
there &apos;s one behind someone who had no childhood .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
and i &apos;ve got all sorts of little things here .
and you know what ? you have wrong .
they have them . they always have .
and some of it has worked and not .
we &apos;re not what &apos;s happening .
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we don &apos;t want to be able to make companies .
we don &apos;t want to have companies .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
... also , the <unk> is a role .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
that &apos;s not what science has nothing to do .
it &apos;s right , moral , <unk> .
so , you see what happens .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m putting the knife in my hand .
what was that ? that &apos;s what i really did .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
that &apos;s ideology , not science .
we were eating food .
and why ? it &apos;s more intuitive .
it &apos;s about like a process .
because we don &apos;t want to <unk> genes ?
the also is a role .
and the shape is a role .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i &apos;m my mind back .
but the key thing is .
there was no <unk> .
why are we doing that ?
it &apos;s not a country .
because you know what ?
one . play .
and he &apos;s working .
great trick ?
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
it &apos;s actually what makes decisions , because if you have a patient , if you have a patient , we &apos;d have two different surgeons , two different brains , which is the one that he &apos;s going to be the person who &apos;s less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon who will be selected .
i mean , most of our most of our lives -- and i &apos;ve got this -- you know , psychological present is about about three seconds . what means you know that there are about 600 million of them . in a month , there are about about men . most of you don &apos;t leave .
the people back to the same or the that later later , you &apos;ll say later , &quot; well , that &apos;s really fascinating , but if it really was real , it would be -- you see , here &apos;s a hole and there &apos;s a hole , and it would be really real . &quot;
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a story , a <unk> of mine , who had a story , and he said he &apos;d have a name , and it was absolutely great music , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and there was a <unk> sound of sound .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you have to do that the self itself is worse , and you have to have that the patient &apos;s own self is a much better way of patient a lot better , because now you have a patient &apos;s own story about your experience .
now , what you could do with patient is , and we actually have clinical trials , and it &apos;s done , and it works , and it works , you can just run the <unk> of patient &apos;s next to you without having to go to it .
and then there &apos;s a <unk> itself , and the <unk> self is the way that the <unk> and the story of our life is going to be the one that &apos;s male to the doctor &apos;s doctor , and it &apos;s what you feel like , &quot; what did you have in time ? &quot;
i think there &apos;s a particular meaning that we might be able to do , but in the large and all the things that we need to be able to get to , and we will think of the complicated view of what &apos;s well-being .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a <unk> of itself , and you can think of the yourself , you think , the self itself is one , which is the kind of self itself , and that &apos;s what you don &apos;t need to do as a <unk> itself .
if you &apos;re going to be a little bit of it -- if you &apos;re too easy -- i have a couple of friends in the hotel and some people i knew not knew , and it &apos;s almost almost any other .
i &apos;ve been published some people the number of books in the last five years , and they &apos;ve been published for about 40 , and they were looking for about 40 , and there &apos;s a lot more .
so i &apos;m going to go out , you know , if you &apos;re going to take the next 30 seconds , or you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first part of the first part of the time .
that &apos;s true for <unk> , who think about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness because we are just as mess as any other .
but i think in this framework , and i &apos;m going to do something real , a bit of a deception , and i &apos;m going to go out of the needle just in there and go through the stage .
from the self , self itself , when you have a holiday and the second week is just as good as the first one , the first is the <unk> vacation as well as the <unk> vacation .
so in fact , the white don &apos;t seem as well as the blue <unk> that doesn &apos;t seem as well as a <unk> , that &apos;s not as good as the needle .
the second one is a direct thing of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s going to be between happy to your life and happy life , or happy with his life .
and the third one is the <unk> , and that &apos;s the problem that we can think about a more , that we can &apos;t make a sense of the well-being of the well-being without the meaning .
there &apos;s a <unk> self that lives in the present and the present , is able to experience the past , but only the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> self , which is the doctor &apos;s doctor -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; do it hurt if i &apos;m going to leave you here ? &quot;
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid and <unk> themselves , and just the skin , just to speak for a couple of minutes . &quot;
it didn &apos;t because he was a memory with a memory memory ; the memory was was , and the memory was being able to keep it all the time .
and in this way , this is actually a critical variable that &apos;s a <unk> itself , a <unk> itself , and time , very little influence of this story .
i have the impression that if we do things very often , the case is that we &apos;re doing to do the right people in the service of self .
these are two very different units of the <unk> self and the self and the self , and the two too , is part of the main part of the field of happiness .
patient b has more profound . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had a patient had a patient , and more .
i &apos;m not going to go into the detail . it &apos;s not more painful , but it was painful than this study in the 1990s .
so , right here , right here , where my meat is , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;m going to make a little <unk> .
but despite all of this great of work , there are multiple cognitive networks that make it almost impossible to think about happiness .
it turns out that the word happiness just simply not a word of it , because we can apply it to many different things .
and the reason that was worse was where the pain was at the end of the end , it &apos;s a terrible story .
because we asked these people to ask , and they &apos;ve asked a lot later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing is ? &quot;
this is a 18 inches long . and it &apos;s very , very <unk> , and i &apos;m going to start a little bit of a little bit of a little .
what really tells us that we could think about ourselves and other people think about the other people in the spirit of two types .
and yet , you get the impression that you &apos;re counting to be able to see what happens during these very <unk> of life .
and as we use them , it &apos;s important to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that the self is taking care of us .
and none of it really really really really <unk> property . it &apos;s just our faith that we have a stronger effect .
so i &apos;m going to put this needle into my skin and through through it , until you go through the other side of it .
and that &apos;s true for stories that we hold and it &apos;s also true for the stories that we invent .
for the self itself , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , no better than the <unk> vacation , because there &apos;s no new memories .
we know that in fact , we have to go out of the needle , if it &apos;s going to go to the needle .
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story is like you &apos;re going to end .
this graph is really -- i &apos;m going to show you a different time when we have a power .
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
our memory tells us that , what we &apos;re going to do is we have to deal with our own minds .
but there &apos;s a other question : &quot; how did these patients feel that they have in common ? &quot;
that will lead to the patient &apos;s suffering , but only a little and a lot of less than before .
this generates a very powerful picture in the head . that &apos;s very much more than a white ball .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the sense of happiness .
and the surprise is that patient a lot of a a lot of <unk> had a lot of the time to be a patient .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think about our future , not as a different .
and just a little bit of through my skin and on the other side , it &apos;s like that .
sorry . if you get a lot of you , look at it , look at it .
and that &apos;s really what you start with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
and none of these stories is very <unk> , or great -- but one of them is a clear ...
so we have the <unk> self itself and the self self , and they &apos;re quite quite different .
and people back to the back , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen that right . &quot;
and then he added , really , really emotional emotional , has changed the whole experience .
i think something is a deception , and i &apos;ll look really look at it .
you can see it , you can also be more <unk> , if you want to be .
we don &apos;t just tell stories , when we do , we &apos;re talking about stories .
well , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> itself .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we &apos;re using , while we &apos;re in the world .
now , the self itself makes more and more than remind stories .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
now we &apos;re actually in the same same way that we &apos;ve had .
i would love to put my arm and show you that there are no truth .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic .
or &quot; how was your journey to ? &quot; &quot; or something like that .
and you &apos;re asked , &quot; who who has more ? &quot;
and it was much worse for a than a <unk> in the <unk> .
end , very , very important , very important and this is the end of the end .
we actually don &apos;t choose the thing between the ; we choose to choose between the .
this is my skin . this is not a rocket from hollywood .
i know what people think of it when you think about it .
this is really my skin . this is not a science from hollywood .
we &apos;re going to be a couple of times in the next days .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
so , what a story of a story are actually a similar , and ends and ends .
and the answer is really easy . they &apos;re lost forever .
okay , let me just take a little bit of blood for you .
i hope you &apos;ll be looking for this . thank you .
there &apos;s an enormous wave of the <unk> of the <unk> of researchers .
and my talk today is mainly today about these cognitive values .
there &apos;s no way of getting it right .
these are real patients who have a <unk> to the one .
from the <unk> self , a dead is probably a time .
and that &apos;s a little hard to use , i think .
but now , you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
this is my meat , and i can do this .
the first of these dropping is a <unk> , complexity .
what it was meant to be the memories of the experience .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
but one of them is worse than the other .
it has huge shape of the <unk> , one after another .
most of them are completely ignored by the <unk> of itself .
the biggest difference between them is the most powerful thing .
i mean , how much do we get from our memories ?
i &apos;m sorry . do you make it crazy ?
let me show you the point of the near .
i mean , it &apos;s a real cognitive problem .
well , the <unk> itself lives lives .
and you ask : what happens to these moments ?
this doesn &apos;t work at all for the <unk> itself .
the <unk> self has no voice in this choice .
we think about our future for a <unk> .
well , i &apos;m going to show you this .
now , what &apos;s going on here ? pretty good .
people are now in the <unk> .
now , the self itself is a whole .
and let &apos;s start with an example of this .
so , i would like to take the needle .
everybody would make people happier .
he had 20 minutes of music music .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness .
so what &apos;s a story of this ?
they didn &apos;t have the history .
yeah , here &apos;s it .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
but it didn &apos;t .
he had the experience .
there &apos;s a old study .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
yeah , i know .
how do we know that ?
well , that &apos;s .
about .
and if you choose to another holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between your two of self , and you have to think about how you decide that conflict , and it &apos;s not obvious , because if you think about it , you &apos;re going to think of the answer , and if you think of the answer , you might have a different response .
now , the seems to do this , maybe i think it &apos;s going to work , so if we can solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , climate conflict , global conflict and obesity , i think we have to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to play at the end of the next decade .
now , i like a little bit extreme , you know , how little i &apos;m going to have to do a lot of my hand , but even if you do more of it , there &apos;s a real question , why are we giving memories so much weight in the <unk> that we give you ?
and when i think about that , i think , a few years ago , the clearly of the best vacation i had ever had , and i think , well , i tend to do a holiday that i think , and how many years of thinking about how many of the other <unk> .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars , for americans , and it &apos;s a very big percentage of americans , about about , but it &apos;s a big percentage of a income income per year .
but one thing will happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you &apos;re going to be reminded of how terrible the weather was in in , and you feel that they feel the right decision .
if we &apos;re in a <unk> , i think that many of us will turn into our best version , and every time we &apos;re getting to , it &apos;s getting to try to try and try to solve the problem , so long , it would try to try and try it back .
and this is what we &apos;ve seen in the millions of <unk> from the world &apos;s world when we take the <unk> of the next century , and the face of what you &apos;re looking at is the face of the <unk> of the <unk> .
the mysterious organization has a global survey , where more than a million people have asked about what they think about their life and their experiences , and there &apos;s other other states in the direction .
now , a very short one , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we can &apos;t look at the same things when we think about life , and when we &apos;re actually living .
i &apos;ve been working for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to make the world in reality , to save the world in reality , how to save in <unk> .
well , it turns out that climate isn &apos;t very important for the self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the self , which is decide to be happy for yourself .
imagine your next holiday , you know , that &apos;s the end of the <unk> all of the <unk> all the time , and you get a <unk> drug , so you &apos;re going to get to yourself .
everybody who who &apos;s not that these terms of the happiness is the common , and i &apos;m a lot of of researchers that have the way that we have in the way that we have in the way that we have a lot of the most powerful long .
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference is , and it &apos;s what we &apos;re saying in climate .
if people take this <unk> seriously , i mean , it &apos;s all on the head of all the things we believe in terms of , for example , in terms of <unk> and so on .
the distinction between the happiness of self itself and the happiness of self itself has been discovered in the last few years , and now you &apos;re now to stop the two of the two .
which that means that if you were to meet someone and you would say , oh , his dad is a <unk> , how much would you know about his size ?
what happens is that money doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , but that lack of money is some of the money to make some risks , and we can measure this ourselves very , very clear .
when i tell you that someone has his life as eight of a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his own <unk> .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will start whether they want to explore whether they want to explore or want to explore , so we have to have a discussion of this discussion .
as you can get happiness , it can be very different on how you think and whether you think about the <unk> self , or you think about the <unk> itself .
you can know how someone someone is to their life , and she doesn &apos;t do that much about how happy he lives and vice living .
well , when we looked at a couple of weeks ago , i gave me to think that there was a fairly interesting result that came out of this .
if you play , you can see some of the south here , which is up to the top of the eyes and the mouth are a sign of optimism . the paintings show surprise .
this is a <unk> in my former hospital in berkeley , california , where i &apos;m in my recent research , why we are in play in the real life .
why ? this is a picture of a really , very clear thing to think about the way that games are so appropriate for survival of human species in the future .
we know that happiness mainly mainly , we like to be happy with people who like , spend time with people who we like .
i think the most interesting thing that we found in the gulf of the people we found in the early survey is a number that we didn &apos;t have to be able to do .
the recognition is going to be slowly in the united states , not question , but in the u.k. they &apos;re going to look at and in other countries .
i have a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including all of them , to spend more time playing playing and play games .
i call it &quot; in life &quot; is &quot; i &apos;m bad at this , and it &apos;s actually my face , you know ? ok .
why we choose the <unk> choices that we choose is a problem that we have with a choice between ourselves .
it &apos;s very hard to think about well-being , and i hope i have a sense of how difficult it is .
and i probably have my memories to this <unk> journey , i would say , about 25 minutes in the last four years .
the conclusion of what i said here is we really don &apos;t really consider ourselves as a <unk> for a <unk> .
if you think about that question , you know , people in california should be in california if you say , in our lives .
is there a chance that politicians that politicians that the country would be generally like the serious thing , and what does the subject of politics ?
well , it seems to me that this topic will be the most important political debate , or to be the most important political debate for the next few years .
you might probably see this sense of urgency , a fear , but also , very fundamental , very difficult to solve the problem of a real hard problem .
a <unk> <unk> is a result that it was so much , it &apos;s so much positive , you didn &apos;t know that it was possible .
and it &apos;s kind of to speak , what happens to people who are going to be able to get to california to be happier in the hope .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase this time .
and if you &apos;re able to do it , they &apos;re actually able to make something that is to be able to do something that is a <unk> .
we &apos;re getting more in more <unk> , and i &apos;m good at the relationship with the motivation , a little bit more , inspired by collaboration .
now , because the self is responsible for it , you can get the end of -- some people might end at the end of the end .
and , by the way , we &apos;re now able to get to get a pretty good idea of happiness in the future of the <unk> itself .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california are they won &apos;t get the correct answer .
maybe something too much time when we think about how many problems we have in the real world .
we &apos;re feeling ourselves . we feel we &apos;re feeling , we feel , maybe , maybe , maybe , frustrated , frustrated , or <unk> .
now , if i spent the guy , i &apos;ve spent a couple of hour in this work , i &apos;ve spent another hour .
and the basic lesson we think , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
so , if you &apos;re the lucky happiness of the two of yourself , you will do very different things .
<unk> : you know , i think there &apos;s a serious point of policy in politics .
and when we fail , when we fail to look at the obstacles , we feel often different .
it &apos;s about how happy or happy person is when this person is about their life .
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve started to learn about happiness of the two kinds of self .
is it something that you can make us do , because you have a few minutes now ?
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they will become more likely , ever , they will be .
people are being , in terms of happiness , they should think about politics .
so i looked at the world of the world of cotton , which is the ideal environment for the <unk> .
but , by the time , the entire american business is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
that &apos;s going to be , i think , in the next , or two decades of national statistics .
three billion hours per week , not nearly for the most difficult problems in the world .
these feelings have never been when we play games , play in play .
but in fact , my research at the institute for the future is the very opposite of the fact .
he wanted to play the feelings playing the front , and so he was a camera on the front of the camera .
well , unfortunately , we see this face in real life when we face hard problems .
there are two concepts of happiness that we can apply to , one of them , a half .
and then you would ask , how happy are the largest life of life itself ?
just to give you a sense of the correlation , that &apos;s related to <unk> .
some of you may think , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time for games games . &quot;
i just realized that the time there was time for 21 times a week .
oh , you know . ok . so we &apos;ve got some more here here .
this is me , &quot; i &apos;m not doing this in life .
why is it possible to think , well , you could not just do anything ?
this is one of the explanations that &apos;s given to the <unk> self .
if you &apos;re looking for happiness , it &apos;s a very different thing to ask .
well , you &apos;d know something about the size of your size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
in the spirit of self , the self itself , you get a different story .
in the united states , you &apos;re going to look at the population of the population .
if you &apos;re not a <unk> , you might be a little bit of the fact that you might have a little bit .
we think that we &apos;re not in reality as well as play .
well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s the day of a year .
now , the two types of self are two terms of happiness .
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for the fact that they &apos;re a fairly complicated process .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
this is a player who &apos;s at the edge of a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the years .
and i &apos;m not just a lot of good , even though it &apos;s about that .
how can we actually change these feelings from the games ?
so you can ask , how happy is the <unk> self ?
we know something about what the happiness of the value of the value .
we found that in terms of happiness , we found it in the happiness .
when we look at how feelings with the income .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as an medication .
so i want you to think about a thought .
that &apos;s not about how happy one person lives .
i mean , i &apos;ve rarely seen flat lines .
we spend three billion hours a week with <unk> .
which is the emotions that can be measured ?
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s the sales .
well , your <unk> itself will not be happier .
the more money you take the stock people .
this is a problem that many players have .
well , would you choose the same vacation ?
thank you . i have a question for you .
i &apos;m jane . i &apos;m making a video .
this is a <unk> of the photographer &apos;s own language .
this is one of the classical expressions of play .
this is a player in a little <unk> .
there &apos;s a matter of being a professional .
we &apos;re going to get a totally flat line .
thank you for the invention of economics .
no , i &apos;m really serious .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
they have a lot of uncertainty .
so the correlation is low .
that &apos;s not true .
daniel <unk> : sure .
thank you , <unk> .
very different thought .
we know that .
<unk> : 60,000 .
thank you .
thank you .
60,000 .
ok , so when we talk about how much time we spend with play , it makes sense to only sense when you go to the scale of human human human human evolution , which is extraordinary .
they went out and went out to a new home , and they were so many people , how to move the food and live with the rest of the country , and they were able to get the rest of them in which they were .
you may have saved their people by play for 18 years by waiting for 18 years , and then they had so much about the time that they learned that they had saved the entire civilization that they had to have .
consider this interesting statistic that recently recently , from a western university of a recent mellon university , the average boy man in a country with a <unk> with <unk> with a country with a <unk> .
so , first , if you put in one of these <unk> , especially at the world of the world , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to get them to a <unk> mission , and it &apos;s immediately .
so , the problem of the world &apos;s brain is that it &apos;s so long to be so <unk> at the edge of a <unk> <unk> , that we &apos;d rather spend our time in the <unk> of the <unk> .
first , for kids in the united states , the high hours of the high school school , they spend the high school school to school , high school -- when you &apos;re never missing .
we &apos;re playing games to try to miss everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , and we &apos;re going to get what we need to do .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve the real world in games ? &quot; and what &apos;s the question i &apos;ve done is the institute for the for the future for the future .
and they would be so much as the <unk> , because games are so fascinating , and we were with <unk> productivity , <unk> productivity that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
so we have a full <unk> <unk> , on the young people as well as what it means to be a good player , how everything else is they learn in school .
but it &apos;s also , because it turns out we &apos;re using the whole time using all the time , actually , what we &apos;re doing as humans are capable of able to do .
the <unk> <unk> developed the energy energy and to save energy , instead of the <unk> , so that players in the world , especially in india , in india , can play online , china .
it &apos;s based on the great research research that , if we spend 10,000 hours with a <unk> study of a single planet to the 21st , we will spend a <unk> on the 21st of a single problem to the 21st .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show people to like we &apos;ve played people , after we &apos;ve played them , even if they were going to hurt us .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the kind of old greek <unk> , you may know this story , you know , the story , the story about how and why games were invented .
we trust that somebody time with us , that the rules are being <unk> with us , that we have the same goal and the way we have the same goal to do .
<unk> is the desire to do something , a more useful , with a solar team , with that we believe that we have a deep hope in success .
the reason is that , if we play , we &apos;re actually working with hard to work , when we don &apos;t have to do it or anything like that .
so they invented , according to <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> a day , and one day , would eat . the next day would play .
we should have to do that half us a day , and we &apos;re going to play with a day of us with a day , until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the physical world .
now , you think that a <unk> can think that a natural defeat can be possible , and it &apos;s always worth to try and do it .
i &apos;m going to show you very quickly three games that i designed to try to try and make people get up in their own future .
they can take better and personal social , as in real life , they get more and more feedback and rewards in play as well .
so , they sent to the one of their civilization to come up with a new world , so i &apos;m going to take my 21 billion <unk> per week .
so , he says , it &apos;s completely easy to make more time that players are more time in the virtual world than in the real time .
but the latest thing that &apos;s shown is that the local kingdom , which later , the roman of the british empire , the same dna as the old <unk> <unk> .
if i &apos;m going to finish this stage , i don &apos;t have a flying and + 1 1 idea , so it &apos;s 20 crazy idea .
here &apos;s a <unk> to the right light to back on the right , you know , all wikipedia , the biggest world , the largest full world of the world .
but there are always the rest of your skills , so you have to do it , but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of the world .
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of the <unk> 22 hours a week , it &apos;s kind of like <unk> .
they have more information about the world of the world &apos;s internet on the internet as a different subject in any other brain in the world .
and according to <unk> , they were so <unk> for 18 years to take this , and they were playing the next .
but not only any mission , but a mission that &apos;s perfect to your current level , right ?
we don &apos;t have that in real life , that sense , that sense that we have a <unk> direct staff .
and there &apos;s this <unk> story , this inspiring story , why we are there and what we have to do .
they have <unk> by &quot; level &quot; and &quot; + &quot; , &quot; or &quot; + intelligence . &quot;
today , all of us have spent all the world of <unk> <unk> million years to solve the virtual problems .
ok , so these are four of us who are to one single outcome . players are <unk> , hopeful , hopeful .
and the only problem is you think they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real thing .
but to see , in the context of the time , a million years ago , our first <unk> <unk> went to .
his work is awesome . he &apos;s looking at why people have so much time , energy and money in the <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to get to do not get out of less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
so he says that this makes sense , because player can be more in more than a real life than the real life .
according to the age of 18 , the civil war was not better , so , the king decided , he was <unk> , a last <unk> <unk> .
we have this effort in our office in our office , it &apos;s just how we should understand the future .
we want to introduce the best outcome , and then people are doing this , and then people are doing this .
where you &apos;re going to do , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to bring their absolute mission .
so many people , we &apos;re currently currently living in the world at least a day at least a hour of a day .
and in the next decade , we have another billion player , which is very good at whatever .
so i started thinking about what it is to do with these games , making these games .
we &apos;d be a big big big , that the king of <unk> came to a crazy idea .
and , i found evidence that a global <unk> of the global <unk> that nearly could explain the famine .
and maybe some of you have a new book from a quick house , &quot; <unk> , &quot; read .
we &apos;re going to be good at whatever the most people are doing the world .
because if we could actually find that , we would have been there , we would never have a human potential potential potential .
the reason is that there &apos;s a lot of trust to play with someone play play game .
we know that we work with human beings , if we work , we &apos;re working hard to work in a job .
you don &apos;t sit around and <unk> , and there &apos;s always something important to do something important .
so , what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are <unk> .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people are extraordinary in &quot; something . &quot;
and then the next day , you would play , and the next day would eat food .
this was the first <unk> in real time in real time . this was 16 years ago .
and players are always ready to work hard if you get the right problem .
the second brain in the world , with almost <unk> <unk> is the world &apos;s world of heart of the brain .
and i &apos;ve realized some things that make the mysterious <unk> that make a possible car in the <unk> .
so you know his theory of the success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s people who believe they can change the world as a world .
according to the <unk> , games were also games , <unk> , in the united kingdom of a success .
we make ourselves mysterious and give people to reach the opportunities to achieve them .
so the big question is , &quot; what are the most powerful players ? &quot;
so , what scientists scientists recently came to think about is that <unk> &apos;s crazy story .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , two reasons .
here are the four things i found . first of all , <unk> .
not like me -- i &apos;m creating games , i &apos;m a little bit more complex .
we &apos;re playing games to escape the real world of the real world .
they played a <unk> and the rest of the war were allowed to be a <unk> adventure .
they were <unk> for 18 years , and we played on 16 years later .
so , the <unk> is the growing of and trust and each other .
players love it to be part of the <unk> of the <unk> &apos;s books .
they create a powerful source of the knowledge of the world &apos;s of of the world .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
they &apos;re never going to have a job that they can &apos;t solve .
my inspiration comes from a event that &apos;s 10 years of <unk> .
there &apos;s this ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
it was a extreme situation . you needed a extreme solution .
i &apos;m going to argue , we &apos;re ready to do our own <unk> .
ok , so imagine , imagine how extreme <unk> .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
and that &apos;s from a economist . so it &apos;s really simple .
and these were the first of people developed the first of people developed .
same , i think we &apos;re going to do today games today .
we don &apos;t try to say the future before we go .
this is not a real feedback problem .
we develop developing <unk> , and creatures .
you expect a extra billion player in the next decade .
as a result , we &apos;re going to build more social relationships .
i &apos;m just going to take that .
what we want to do is create the future .
i get the real life of this feedback .
that &apos;s the truth . i think .
players are masters of the fast <unk> social nets .
then we get this whole positive positive feedback .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
so we have a billion billion people .
five million people use it every month .
and this was <unk> , and there was <unk> .
people were born . the people were being believed .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
they shared the world in two .
that &apos;s not necessarily bad .
but it &apos;s definitely not a <unk> .
so this crazy story could be voices .
so , we can also do it .
and there are plenty of staff .
so the first one is true .
and finally , bill importance .
they create a bold story .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
that sounds crazy , right ?
we &apos;re in the since 1994 .
so they can do that .
it sounds perhaps .
players are not sitting around .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
this is the exciting exciting .
and he says ...
so , the <unk> is invented , but you have enough <unk> , so it &apos;s actually a real life , and then you &apos;re going to make a lot of oil , you know , where it &apos;s going to be a lot of oil , how it &apos;s going to be closed , how to be closed , how to be closed , how is it that they &apos;re closed , and they &apos;re going to figure out how to make their real life if it &apos;s true , and you ask them to stop thinking about it , or videos , and we ask them to stop , videos , or photos .
from the medical point of view , you can say , my legs , the <unk> , <unk> from <unk> and artificial <unk> for aging for the body , to be able to use all the natural tools , to be able to develop their natural fate , to be not talking to the social <unk> , to people , to give people a own identity , and to make people be in the world of groups that they &apos;re themselves .
so the human ability to do this -- this is an interesting story , because people are always asking me to talk about how i &apos;m talking about <unk> and i &apos;m going to tell you something that has never been me , and i always have to keep very uncomfortable about people to answer the questions of people , and i think , why .
and of course , that was just a simple trick of dr. inmates that i didn &apos;t want to do with the way that the next half girls in the second floor , but he actually got me to see my daily <unk> , but he actually got me to see my everyday <unk> with new eyes .
this sentence of the <unk> with the idea of success , that success or happiness of a challenge to become a challenge without being connected to the experience of being so broken , as my life was so successful , because i could feel the way of a life with a prosthetic , or whatever people feel with my physical .
&quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and also , <unk> , were also useless and weak .
it would be great if we have this paradigm of the animal &apos;s disease against one different or the strength to create even more dangerous , and it &apos;s possible to create the forces of very many children , and they &apos;re willing to invite their own special and skills in society .
in our desire to protect people who are in the heart and the best , hard to be hard to understand their medical , or even a way to get on quality of life , we have to be able to find out that we don &apos;t have to be able to do that for that , that someone is actually .
i had to put a single set of things to do with these big , with these big , , with these big , -- and i &apos;ve been able to build these pictures , and i &apos;ve got these pictures more than anything else . i &apos;ve got it . i &apos;ve got it .
i read this list a day and i had to laugh , laughing , it was like ridiculous , but i had only had to go to and i could go to the cover , and i was able to read that <unk> , and i was able to get the same thing that &apos;s been <unk> .
and one day he was looking at me at one of my studies -- these are just <unk> and <unk> -- and he said , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re a powerful , and a young girl , you &apos;re a strong , and a young girl , you &apos;ll be going to be one day .
if i was born this one , i would be born to a world who could be someone like me as a person , could be able to grow in a way that could be able to be a good thing , and i &apos;m going to have a lot of the opportunities that i &apos;ve experienced .
i think , i think that &apos;s more about to realize that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome , but we &apos;re open to the open , but we &apos;re going to be open to the phone , to use it to use a <unk> and maybe even use it .
so , this technological change is that this technological change has been more clear because there &apos;s a other truth , which is that every human being can give a very <unk> and very powerful , and very , and the human ability to do , is that we &apos;re going to be able to do our biggest plus .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early 1980s , when i was working with the primary school and started to start thinking about my own life outside of my own , and also in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you never walk , and never would be like the would be like like other kids or you &apos;ve never have a independent life , and then you &apos;ve never been <unk> me . &quot;
and because i was born with no <unk> , and my feet were just coming up with a couple of toes and a few toes on the other foot , he was the <unk> , he had to be the <unk> , the bad news .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everybody &apos;s in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our task , the future , energy , food , health , and the future of social justice .
i &apos;ve been writing my <unk> , but i &apos;ve done this with the <unk> of the <unk> , and i realized that i &apos;ve never done a lot of time in my life , which is the word &quot; sexual &quot; .
and i &apos;m wondering today how much his vision of me as strong and independent young girls have my self , and i could imagine that i could see myself as a <unk> , more powerful and more powerful person .
there are all in the lives of the and challenges , and they &apos;re just <unk> real real real , and every person is different to us , but the question is , if we &apos;re not with with <unk> , or not , but how we get to deal with it .
but as we &apos;ve already made examples of the <unk> , the <unk> , not a sense of our language , to imagine what we all wish to do : it &apos;s going to enable us to be able to see people as a powerful people .
i want to invite you all the invite to share this game with young people , all over the world , especially in <unk> , who are asking them to create their own social values .
there &apos;s evidence that we have now have 60,000 years ago , and people have been using heavy physical injury , and it &apos;s been done because the <unk> of the <unk> of the people in the <unk> of this people &apos;s valuable system .
we should not be these <unk> times or no , we should not try to avoid them , we should not have to go under the rug , but it &apos;s about what we &apos;re going to see in the most common opportunities .
a lot of societies , including the number of societies , the one of the number of people who have found that the reason they have a huge force , because what they &apos;re doing is what you can think about , can also be <unk> .
in this year , we were following the 200 . the birthday of charles darwin and when he wrote about 150 years ago , darwin has been <unk> , in my eye , to find a very much of the human character .
a couple years ago , i went to the city where i was growing up , in a <unk> zone in the <unk> of the <unk> zone , and i was standing there in a <unk> .
well , i hope you &apos;re going to agree with it , the more human resources that we can do is to work on the real life , and that games are a big meaning for change .
and to be honest , the only thing that i had to do , and that i had to make myself , that the world &apos;s mind , that i &apos;m going to be able to do it with these definitions .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being , and not all of our forces and possibility of opportunity and others , we &apos;re able to find the natural struggle , which you might have to lead , another disease .
this was dr. <unk> , a man that i only knew from my mother &apos;s mother , because i was , of course , very typical , to my birthday two weeks .
perhaps the concept of the that is just about what is inside , which is a broken , and how we repair it , for every single psychiatric industry .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , as you can think about , most americans didn &apos;t exactly the correct , so he was always named dr. mentioned .
not only about darwin &apos;s great thing we know is that the ability to survive and survive , from the struggle of the human mind , is the way through the human mind .
you know , you know , you know , <unk> , where you have &quot; <unk> &quot; -- you have the astronauts , the scientist , and you can save the world &apos;s most .
if i &apos;m going to <unk> the next decade , i &apos;m sure two things that we can create , that we can create a certain future future , and that we can play all the kinds of games .
i would like to be able to be the most powerful of its species , and not the most powerful thing that &apos;s going to be able to do with it .
there &apos;s the usual . . the typical . but not the normal . and you would know that , some of the things that really know about it , if you really get it ?
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people we love to be before , but they also have to get it well to get good at all .
you have to be two things : to be able to think about the medical , to be a good fact , to be able to think about it , and the other is a lot of the social .
we have all these fantastic , we have games that we show us what we can do , but we have not saved the real world yet .
and imagine , i &apos;ve been working on a <unk> , a <unk> kid , and so i tried to stop this , without success , without no success .
but the truth is that we &apos;re going to change it , of course , we &apos;re the challenge , whether it &apos;s physical , or even both the way .
and maybe we can do it as a natural , as a natural , and and we &apos;re feeling , and we &apos;re feeling , and we &apos;re feeling that as a lot of these , not so much as the presence .
the doctor for <unk> &apos;s daughter &apos;s medicine was on the holiday , and so my parents had the man who had me to the world , at all .
and what we found is that we &apos;ve found people from the members of our society , and we have a force to be useful : useful and money .
we have this whole , <unk> productivity , the ability to create the ability to create social social nets , and the ability to make sense of the meaning .
we have a comic team . we have &quot; level of &quot; for <unk> , sustainability , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> , and i just thought that the way that the way that i had to be quite old .
sometimes i can see that he &apos;s very present , sometimes it &apos;s not to see , but he &apos;s all at me .
i think the biggest damage we have to make ourselves is that we should be normal .
we tested this game with the elderly players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been following it since the last three years .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about a couple of months ago , and i was writing a little bit of a <unk> .
a human being opened for me to have opened my pediatrician , my pediatrician , on the <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
and we don &apos;t like our kids to go out of the time when we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
find out how they would be to survive , most of our players have the most stable thing in the game .
and the last game we put on the third third march , and it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get the <unk> of the world &apos;s greatest <unk> , in 2010 , in 2010 .
i really hope that we can play together games to make this planet one another century .
so i started the <unk> of 2009 , and i think i &apos;d find a <unk> more exciting .
i found that time i spent in this hospital , just great -- to my <unk> .
but the most important thing is that it &apos;s between perception of perception and our great <unk> , there &apos;s a connection .
perhaps that &apos;s the sense of <unk> , a sense of the <unk> , a sense of our own power .
and i hear like a guy behind me , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee .
and i said , &quot; excuse , sir , sir , we know ? i &apos;m not remember that . &quot;
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventure , and you &apos;re going to say , &quot; we &apos;re going to get out of the oil . &quot;
so , first of all , the calculation of a <unk> that that people have left only 23 years of the planet .
and what i did was , in particular , the last two words , the last two words , &quot; &quot; all the time .
just a person who &apos;s been able to call a kid , and they &apos;re going to be able to do their ideas .
they didn &apos;t have these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something and valuable .
no one wants to change their life , because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
so we have a lot of the next to the next game , we &apos;re going to find the more , more common goal .
the call to the player , we have to have almost like a <unk> , and we &apos;re going to be doing it .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can be published when they &apos;re &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we can use these values .
and dr. <unk> was always wearing the same thing , and it was just like making me .
this is just one example of many of how adults can be able to have the imagination in the <unk> .
our language <unk> the social changes that were happening in many cases , in a lot of the technological change .
there are no obstacle that we need to be able to get out of the way that we &apos;re going to be clear .
and maybe we know we &apos;re going to be able to get out of wood , we &apos;re going to be really going to be .
and i &apos;m taking care of and i see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
when i first saw it , i was going to be able to take her from my mother &apos;s arm . &quot;
it &apos;s about what we think about the people we think about .
our language is influenced our way and how we see the world and the people around us .
so we need to focus out the <unk> beyond , and we can focus on all the human possibilities .
we &apos;re working in universities in africa and shop , and they &apos;re learning to do social food .
so , what do we want to do is do a financial person , or a healthy people ?
and i want to do the impact of the impact of the human being , and it &apos;s a human being .
and he said , &quot; well , you may remember me .
we can give a new meaning that goes beyond tough times .
there are a way of a change that we have not yet yet .
we &apos;ve been doing this game &quot; <unk> &quot; to the institute of the future .
and i hope you &apos;ll be playing with me and play .
so again , again , change and practice are the greatest capacity of humans .
it &apos;s a <unk> where you have to have a <unk> .
and if you &apos;re going to give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
we &apos;re <unk> a human being that &apos;s worth our society .
and i can tell you , it was an change .
and i tend to see <unk> as my shadow .
this is a real adventure to do that .
this is called &quot; global <unk> <unk> &quot; , of course .
and thank god , i didn &apos;t use that .
so i &apos;m going to start , let &apos;s start on the <unk> .
wouldn &apos;t it be to be a potential to open up ?
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
well , 8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
what , what do you think happens next ?
<unk> : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about words .
and i &apos;m saying that this is good .
it was summer and i had a lot of time .
and of course , it &apos;s made it .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
we can give us a little bit .
maybe we can see the <unk> as change .
i read the post .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
<unk> are just our lives .
time is -- who &apos;s normal ?
the game is from 2007 .
so i &apos;m now going to go .
i want to ask you something .
i don &apos;t think so .
conflict &apos;s creativity is creativity .
there &apos;s no normal .
oh , so .
thank you .
i want to end by a poem that &apos;s been written by a grave poet in the 14th century , and the one that &apos;s known for four words , &quot; &quot; every kid knows god , not the god &apos;s name , not the god &apos;s name , not the god &apos;s name , but the god who just knows four words and this time , and he always says , come , come with me . &quot;
in fact , i found that he had a lot of my childhood childhood , whether i had a <unk> at the second grade , whether i had a college or a of my latest <unk> , and i had used to be able to teach the <unk> , and he used to be the students to teach the students , <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
well , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t think about the evidence that you think about the evolution of biological evolution , you have to give them the permission -- and maybe you can take a look at <unk> , and you can look at a look at a book , &quot; which is wrong , because nothing else you can do is make sense of them .
now , let &apos;s go back to the time , and the earth &apos;s system , about 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the system , about four to four years ago -- the first <unk> of living organisms on earth -- the first <unk> organisms , maybe as much as a billion years ago -- and then the human species , and then the human species that are happening in the last few years .
in this picture , i have a bush as a center of the center of all the directions in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree , all the existing <unk> at the tips of these resources have been success in evolutionary success : they have lived ; it &apos;s made of his environment and strength .
so what happens if we look at this , what happens in evolution , and how we think about the space , people in the evolution , and mostly mostly we &apos;re going to take in the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a series of opportunity .
and dr. <unk> said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids when you don &apos;t get anything else , and even if they &apos;re not a little bit of a support , and when they &apos;re a little bit of a lot of children , if you &apos;re children , then children can do a lot . &quot;
if you allow someone to do it , you can go into your own , the human mind -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you open it , and you have a door to a very good teacher , you &apos;re for for those people .
now , i must say , if i was a <unk> , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed to be pretty reasonable at the time , but with every year , it &apos;s going to come up with my own .
i fell in the power of evolution , and i think something very much fundamental , in most of the existence of life in <unk> organisms , is a cell , and all the genetic information that are going to be in both of the other side of the cell .
they &apos;ve got a <unk> and a lot of time to come up with a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- they said , &quot; well , they &apos;ve been very good , and they really have written it up . and after that three months they really written it .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are the ones that are <unk> and the round of surviving survival , if fish were there , they would be a vacuum of roads , and they have a vacuum system for themselves , they have a <unk> environment .
the great amount of the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was a <unk> in the russian helicopter , which was a single word , &quot; nothing in the biology , &quot; nothing in biology , in the <unk> of evolution .
and i &apos;ve been thinking , in the course of the time , when i asked me to have a age of 15 years , i would have asked my nose to have legs and bone , and i would have asked , i don &apos;t have a second <unk> .
but if we &apos;re able to continue the human mind to support , to continue to feel and other people around , and to find some ways to find some of the things we do , and we &apos;re really positive .
the only real mental illness is a <unk> mind , a mind that has been broken , has no hope , no hope , he &apos;s no longer any more of it , and our increasingly capacity to do .
and perhaps that change , that change , because i &apos;ve been so many people who have opened me to the doors , instead of watching people to realize that , instead of having me , i want to do a sense of vision .
from a evolutionary point of view , you &apos;re and i &apos;m like <unk> rockets , to bring the genetic <unk> into the next stage of the web to the way to get the ocean .
do you realize that we can use it to be able to use the mechanisms of a common bacterium , to create the protein of the human genome that is used to treat the protein ?
in this vast forest of the universe , the universe is just the life of earth ; the animal is just short ; the animal is just a little bit of the human life , and the human life .
and the reason that it was us to do is we &apos;ve been able to get a lot of genes , and it &apos;s been gone out of the population of the genes that we &apos;ve been able to have .
and second , we &apos;re as a species of our environment so that we &apos;ve made it so that they &apos;re able to adapt to us in the way that we &apos;re going to have .
and so the isolation goes when we &apos;re seeing a species of planet planet , will be more and the change of the environment , which might be evolution in natural ways .
it seems like we &apos;re going to be quite large from the other parts of the life , but actually the most part of the time , the basic mechanisms of our cells are pretty equal to us .
i think we would all be the imagination , the rays of all the wine , to understand , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do a creative through my job .
and by the way , we &apos;re and we &apos;re looking and we &apos;re going to see so much that they can &apos;t longer , that isolation is necessary for evolution , to the evolution of the .
they &apos;ve been told that the <unk> and they are in the way they &apos;re talking about the grade , and they &apos;re doing something like that , and they &apos;re going to be able to do something and they treated them .
and in fact , what do we talk about bacteria , is that everybody of us in our gut are more bacteria than it will be able to lead into the rest of our body ?
i call it <unk> -- the new development that &apos;s not just , of course , but i &apos;ve been , and we &apos;ve got to do it as a result of the decisions .
and i came to the realization as a doctor , i was a goal that was a goal of evolution -- not necessarily the same thing , just as a result .
look , it really requires one who &apos;s really <unk> you can use their powers , and they &apos;re through .
evolution is a <unk> theme of this talk here , but i want to give you the point of a story that &apos;s going to be a little bit of a .
but if you take biological evolution , remember , it &apos;s just about the past , or it &apos;s about the future , or what &apos;s the future ?
in fact , you could say that the <unk> of the future of the death of our body is in the same moment as the sexual body .
i came to understand the feelings of george burns to be able to read the show in the &apos; 90s in the &apos; 90s .
suppose i said that , through some few changes , your genes could have a better memory -- more and faster , more and faster .
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that &apos;s going to be the most of the heart .
one second possibility is that it &apos;s a evolution of the traditional species , of course , is the most of nature .
but only those who are in school -- except apart from the students that had been able to make school .
and very important : with the chance of sexual evolution that we have to do is the rest of the body &apos;s body , the rest of the body .
and of course , it &apos;s a heart of the heart of the heart of the <unk> , they were just enough to be enough .
the human part of this brain , far at the end of that , of course , is that we are most interested in .
i mean , think that if you ask , if you ask the power of , you think about the bacteria ?
it &apos;s really a easier for bacteria , with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but , you know , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for those bacteria , just as they &apos;re important for their lives .
or are we going to be something else -- something that may even better be more than the environment ?
he understood that the medical resistance , and how someone was working with , two different things .
this is also the <unk> of this talk , so i hope to give you , d for it .
evolution is all about the genome of the next generation , and the generation of the generation of the generation .
you can &apos;t just be enough to how that factor of the human being can be .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve been doing something with my own legs , and not even of that experiences .
they call this &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the u.s. states , we call this &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t work for the most powerful , the most likely or the economies , and not even the controls .
now , first of all , we think of the reality that people are doing today , in some cultures .
in the &apos; 60s , in the united states , the u.k. was <unk> into <unk> .
if a spirit of these qualities are actually , we can create a new reality and create new kinds of things .
and you &apos;ll all be able to use all the controls that you could have to help .
and the argument here is that the changes of evolution is slowly , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and he called this part of his <unk> , the x existence of the human &apos;s human mind .
we &apos;re from a common ancestors to modern chimpanzees , about six or eight million years ago .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s more comfortable . it &apos;s very comfortable .
they help in the environmental world , and they protect them against certain diseases .
well , when i was a college in college , i had my first <unk> .
but time to change the organisms , when it was a lot of things , it started to change .
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the pollution .
the real meaning of the <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
or , you &apos;re one of those who have been more and more creativity .
it means something that is happening in one , the potential is the potential of the potential .
if you could only one of them , it would be a very different world .
in that period , there might be 20 or 25 different <unk> of people .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
if you ask me to say that , i &apos;m not sure .
and the student will become <unk> harder , getting the better teachers and so forth .
very important , the study of the study was that the teachers were not .
which would you like to have , if you could have one ?
a few , you know , probably a lot of people like this .
evolution <unk> the creatures that adapt to their environment .
but there &apos;s a third way to do a <unk> , fascinating and scary possibility .
ah , the majority . i &apos;m like to be a doctor .
i wanted to make a long and healthy life .
how would you be better than you &apos;re going to be ?
or want to be more <unk> , more powerful , more force .
are we in a kind of <unk> balance in a species ?
and one night , there &apos;s a <unk> at the top of his <unk> .
they bring them to open up their doors .
and then , in the course , it was also for three months .
how would it be to live in good health ?
is it that you have to do it for other or , or is it ?
this is another view of life .
our gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for those bacteria .
i was fascinated by the boston and beauty of biology .
the first is that we don &apos;t get to be set up .
how could it be possible to do this ?
you see , dr. <unk> has changed his way .
again , what potential is we want to be doing ?
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
raise your hands . let me see .
how many would have a good value ?
i want to reach it by not illegal . &quot;
evolution is not the longest life to prefer the longest lives .
come on , dance with me . thank you .
we &apos;ve been there for about <unk> years .
before him , a beautifully <unk> , it &apos;s a beautifully <unk> .
i tried to keep the body .
i wanted to make the health after a disease .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
but what is going on in the future ?
i was going to be known to see .
students are getting to grades .
do you want to be more complicated and more ?
which would you like most of the time ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
we &apos;ve been able to achieve a balance .
now , how did this happen ?
how about fitness ?
is that all the way ?
or is it possible to be .
some of them came come and went .
sexual body &apos;s own body .
i wanted to hold healthy .
that &apos;s very good .
a few more .
what about longevity ?
10 times 10 times .
he opens the door .
a few less .
we were .
creativity .
a few years ago , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for his research , he was a adult <unk> , a <unk> , and through the used by the only four genes , the cell cell , to put them into a common animal -- a cell potentially able to be able to be able to be able to be cell .
one week , the national academy of the country &apos;s prize <unk> prize for the end of the world &apos;s <unk> and <unk> <unk> , two scientists , the other of evolution , to help and work on the <unk> of proteins in a more advanced way -- which is a <unk> <unk> .
now , not exactly what i had to do , but i went to the fishermen , the walked up the deep , the real &quot; <unk> , &quot; at this time , the brain , were pretty ready to get into the bedroom of shoes .
what if you could take the gun and <unk> the fresh <unk> , to make your kids better for a better life to give their kids to a better opportunity -- the diabetes , the <unk> , the risk of cancer ?
now to show you now , what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about american soldiers who are on average average , which is on average , and it &apos;s the resource that you need to make more equipment .
there was some lawyer or a <unk> , who was now now for the rest of his life , people could tell people that he was in a <unk> house , only because he was a <unk> , only because he was five seconds faster than me .
the congo is a paradox -- a country of biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness -- the one of the violent particles that have been since decades has been since decades of life has been as many of the world .
let me introduce you to you , which is a <unk> , <unk> , 19 years ago , a <unk> , which has been a result that has no longer been since 19 years ago .
and if we &apos;re at a place where we can take it to the next generation , and we can use the benefits that we want to be , we will be transformed by the evolution of <unk> evolution .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential to change life , to change life -- not just for the soldiers , or for everyone , or for everybody , but for all the users , but for all of us .
and i &apos;m in the profession , as a body of the , as a i &apos;m in my own , as a great sister , i &apos;m seen in the great scale , but i also see the idea of the and the <unk> of individual .
the other volunteers that happened to me was -- we call him <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; the first thing that was going to be asked to save the house and the dog &apos;s dog .
and then the heroic technology , the same thing that the same function can change the changes to prevent disease , potentially to prevent the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- the better memory .
they &apos;re not something else than they &apos;re in the morning , and they give them extra strength , and they will help increase it , and they will help their balance .
so if i look at this room in this room and people see that they have been suffering , or their way to get there , i want to offer this : don &apos;t get to be able to get this memory .
and on the end of all , we will ever be able to create wisdom , and the wisdom of the that we need to be able to make this decisions ?
we &apos;re talking about very young people with spinal cord , who who in the face of their life -- 20s , politicians , who were made , by the fate , the wheelchair is the only one option .
i want you to imagine , you know , a portable robot , which is to give you a <unk> robot , or another , the one that helps you to go back and go to .
the same technology that can produced the human insulin can produce bacteria that can &apos;t even protect itself , but also to be able to serve other viruses .
we &apos;re going to have a process that takes 100,000 years , and we can take it on a thousand years -- and maybe even further for the next 100 years .
so , think if it &apos;s not possible , but if you could have the sex of your child , but also the brain cells would prevent and prevent the diseases .
it &apos;s not going to take long time to the reality that it &apos;s going to be the 1,000 dollars human genome , and it &apos;s going to be more available for everybody to be available .
there are also also , <unk> , the <unk> , is on their own , just like their <unk> , they &apos;re moving to their own , very <unk> and very natural .
a place where the women are going to lead to sex , sex &quot; hello &quot; and the game will give you a day -- where is a serious one .
today you can take a sequence of three billion human genome , a cost of about 20,000 20,000 and in the space of about $ dollars and the space of a week .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s a experimental study in gang with vaccine that have been grown into the cells with a <unk> .
well , in our city , in the volunteers , volunteers have to be a <unk> , to be a pretty early at the <unk> .
when i found the <unk> , he was just in a very serious conversation with the <unk> that certainly was one of the worst days of their lives .
it was the middle of the night , and she was standing in the <unk> and <unk> under a screen outside the <unk> , and her house was <unk> .
not every day , we will offer a chance to save life of a human life , but every day we can change the possibility of one .
what if they could make the genetic change , to be able to do diabetes or to have the disease or or or or to use or use or use of the end ?
so we thought that we would take this challenge and create a <unk> that would help help with this problem .
technology has been <unk> to me since i &apos;ve got to learn to go back to the hands of the time , and even to drive hands .
a few weeks later , the <unk> <unk> was a letter of the <unk> , which she was going to be able to use the <unk> for the <unk> of your house .
they really got up in because that &apos;s where it leads to a very <unk> society , in the most effective violence .
and the next year , when it finished finished in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in <unk> to four months .
why don &apos;t we have the <unk> of a ken <unk> , <unk> , especially if you can turn it back with the next generation of the ?
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the water to meet us and discuss them .
but it was still one of the other volunteers to get the other volunteers to get the time and what what would our work would be .
not a long time after a doctor , in my <unk> , he said , &quot; hell , you can &apos;t go again . &quot;
or do we going to have different different options that we want to have for some of us and not for us ?
and so the only option -- when it comes to a <unk> , or another , or the wheelchair -- is the wheelchair .
his fully <unk> sensors on the crutches , the signals of <unk> in our <unk> , which is <unk> on your back .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family is .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of their cause ?
we put our guess out to the <unk> , where , where , not surprisingly , much more attention to my much more attention than my .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in life in life in a different way to get their first million .
do we use a decision to form a society that is better , the more successful , is the cultural ?
let &apos;s look at our look at the <unk> , something that i &apos;m particularly interested in .
and so , by the way , the way that i have to say is , in the way , for 500 years , i have to say , very much .
you have to go to the top , and you have to get a few shoes . &quot;
i was able to go back to the bottom , where i was going to get my <unk> and the loved dog .
that means we have a common ancestor , a evolutionary grandmother , which was about six million years ago .
in the good , in the evil , and they used to think , are these decisions are going to be us .
but not only that -- and it &apos;s out of the universe and other devices out there .
it feels what i want to do where i want to go and pull my strength and i &apos;m going to turn out and give you my strength .
so we thought we could begin to write a completely new project in the field of mobility .
if i don &apos;t have the poverty , i &apos;m <unk> as a <unk> of a <unk> in a volunteer <unk> .
why not have the fast fast that you will be able to walk and walk faster ?
and the design process is to allow you to move deep , and to be able to do extremely movements .
i was 24 years old and in <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> while a <unk> <unk> <unk> while a <unk> .
i was the second volunteers on the <unk> , so i had a good opportunity .
as you &apos;re in the <unk> , fear <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> females .
they are in some cultures , the choice of the election , to have more men .
soldier : with the <unk> , i can carry 200 pounds of terrain terrain , for hours , for hours .
we are far as we can imagine our <unk> of this device , this new <unk> system in this year .
at home in new york , i am <unk> <unk> <unk> a non-profit organization called robin <unk> .
of course , this has been a lot of major questions -- <unk> , 30 percent of it -- is a significant <unk> .
i &apos;m just going to have a community back from a community that &apos;s the secret of humanity &apos;s secret .
they live in the deep sea of the <unk> , and they &apos;re just simply hard to get hard .
these are decisions with which their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are already going to be .
so let me introduce you to now -- or the human universal universal universal .
one of them used to be more complicated , and somebody else had a few shoes .
this is all reality today , and in the future , will be more possible .
are we going to create a society of a society and more <unk> , or more and more robust ?
in a fraction of a second , i lost every sense and every movement underneath my <unk> .
but nothing invented that i would go back to me , until now .
they &apos;re in a <unk> , they put a park in the neighborhood .
wouldn &apos;t they want to be able to do these changes in your genes ?
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
but it &apos;s also about the second population , which is very different .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of this in the narrative of human evolution .
if we &apos;re <unk> , this kind of changes will be possible .
this is actually the true thing of human and machine .
there are people who are in the world &apos;s far for the world in the wheelchair .
he said , &quot; says , &quot; &quot; you have to go into the house .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
can you imagine something that &apos;s coming from from ?
these are the kinds of questions we need to be .
if you give something to give you , you &apos;re going to do it now .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> or san francisco .
this is the world &apos;s wild <unk> in the face of the congo .
so , imagine two other small changes .
but sadly , the least among least , among least the world .
and that &apos;s actually an conservative estimate .
so they put it ; they &apos;re going to save the shoes .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
you have the next living with our new living related .
we call this robot &apos;s robot .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
as i said , search is our <unk> .
he <unk> every <unk> of my consciousness .
the dog ! i was digital from the heart .
well , chimpanzees are famous for their <unk> .
but please , the other side of the rest of the rest .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
i remember my first fire .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
ladies and gentlemen , your mothers .
and that was a 19 age .
well , i was the next .
the <unk> <unk> me .
it cost $ billion dollars .
these changes are in the .
who doesn &apos;t want to be a child ?
why not live longer ?
these are going to be <unk> .
so it &apos;s true .
they are all important .
be a reward .
it &apos;s got sensors .
i swear to it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting because it shows the <unk> , which you can take new elements to imagine -- as the testicles -- and also , as the finish thing , and also , as it does , as it does , as it does , as it
another example : a couple of years ago , i received the call of a 19 man , who was born as a boy , a friend , had sex with his girlfriend , he was a friend of sex , and he just had a lot of he had found that he had a lot of <unk> and a bunch
so , we have a situation where we have to look at our science , we have to have more to have more important , that these categories that we &apos;ve been given for common common , which is very simple <unk> to create vast <unk> , much more than we have .
we now know that gender is hard enough to admit that gender is difficult to tell us that nature is not a line of us and lower , or the male and <unk> , and <unk> , we are <unk> that that are natural , of course .
i find that you were so <unk> and so forth , what they did was , i was all of the years of <unk> all the years of <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
most women , like i think -- i think a typical woman -- i think i don &apos;t know my real <unk> , but i think i probably have the typical typical -- most women like me , actually , on <unk> .
the reason why kids do with this kind of body -- is it <unk> or <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s often <unk> -- from a lot of people often be the norm , not because this is a physical health .
and as a result , we &apos;re looking at the fight with the really difficult question when someone is dead , and that makes us a really difficult situation that we didn &apos;t have as much as we used to .
i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> , and in this case , i study how people do anatomy with anatomy -- human body -- -- so that they have <unk> , with <unk> , with <unk> ; how they thought about body bodies .
so we have the concept that a woman is being an female identity , a black person , is to be a african , to have a african anatomy in terms of the story .
the other hat i &apos;ve had to do work with my work is the one that &apos;s got to be , as i sometimes say , as a designer designer -- people who are doctors are doctors .
<unk> and the cost of the <unk> of the <unk> , you couldn &apos;t even fill a cell with the <unk> -- and even there &apos;s no way we &apos;re not sure to be honest .
but it takes mostly time to get away and grow their blood and grow , but not their point of time , until someone comes to something that is different .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got a bunch of health problems , because he was <unk> , because he was the <unk> , that he was in the inner mind .
while we &apos;re our science , we continue to continue to get increasingly into a zone of the <unk> , where we have to recognize that the <unk> standard categories that we &apos;ve had , we &apos;ve probably been simple .
one of the areas that we see is that we see the <unk> , in our culture culture , in the world today , are the struggle over the beginning and the end of the life .
in a case , you might have a <unk> with a <unk> , and the <unk> gene of the wild , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that we all have to miss every single thing .
the consequence is that , as i actually had a brain , a brain has been more than being more than a woman who was born with <unk> , and a <unk> .
now i don &apos;t want you to use it too much time to imagine the <unk> , because if you &apos;re all the time , you &apos;re not listening to me .
where i had been suffering in last time , the most powerful <unk> was <unk> last year , whose gender was asked in the <unk> in the <unk> in a question .
we know it as &quot; love instead &quot; because they have <unk> , also <unk> sex , also sex sex sex with partners and rules and rules .
and they make a few tests and find out that they &apos;re instead of <unk> and and they &apos;re actually in fact , and they &apos;re actually testicles .
but it also true a secret for our future , a future that we need to adapt to the cultural challenges , through greater creativity and <unk> .
so traditional is really complicated ; <unk> are not only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , can be distributed across the whole range .
play is a <unk> , and it can be many of a lot of them , some of some of those things are still , curious -- curious -- perhaps to take the core .
and it &apos;s this simple curiosity that makes us make , and interact and the vulnerable the unexpected that we &apos;re forming , the real part of creativity .
i want you to imagine two couples , the center of the same , the same day , right at exactly same time , every single baby -- okay .
what she was was a <unk> concept , and they &apos;re doing it through another , that was radical and beautiful years of being <unk> and 200 years of interest .
as you remember all , our <unk> the concept of concept , and the monarchy on the <unk> , a very few concept of anatomy .
so , creativity creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the diversity of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of diversity , diversity of connections .
and so , my favorite , let &apos;s share this gift of evolution and together , while we &apos;re the creativity and the fear of the absolute and the wonder .
and in this scenario , you imagine that in a case , a tail &apos;s tail is a y based on the x chromosome .
a lot of people , i mean , the question of , &quot; what are the test of the test , &quot; what are the <unk> female or male ?
and very often , i &apos;ve worked with people who are working on the human population , their gender <unk> -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female <unk> .
i &apos;m not saying that , the answer to all the problems of the problems is that the life of the financial system is made out more than the <unk> .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body , it &apos;s actually something very different , and we &apos;re really going to do this in terms of these <unk> .
we have some conversations about what &apos;s going to be a body to people , so he has a different right than the life .
he &apos;s got <unk> prosthetic prosthetic , and in the utero , his <unk> , so strong , that she made a lot of <unk> .
now , you can imagine how it &apos;s like the magic that &apos;s going to be born , two people in a body .
we have very difficult today -- perhaps not as public as medicine -- about the question when someone is dead .
it &apos;s important to understand that you might be a male that &apos;s actually going to be a lot of the male , but they &apos;re not really .
they have a standing down to a feather , and when they moved , they don &apos;t have it yet .
now , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you some unique images in the wild .
i give them just a few examples of the same types of <unk> that are not the male or female standard .
the reason why they &apos;re going to be different to be able to be these other parts of the time , because they have our social categories .
so to tell you that this is about this <unk> , i have to first first that i &apos;m a big fan of the .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a <unk> laugh that the trees are falling .
i think just as you play , we sometimes play , and we &apos;re <unk> the limitations of our inner and outer worlds .
and in the other case , it &apos;s a x chromosome that &apos;s going to put the x chromosome on the x chromosome .
but because of that individual , the standard missing the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to the testosterone .
but today we &apos;re in a situation where we &apos;re going to read people <unk> organs and they &apos;re other people to be the other .
i &apos;m a political <unk> , i &apos;m <unk> people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit it , i think , makes me nervous .
and when you look at the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance and rituals .
and i want to show you , this is a <unk> female , a young female , and she &apos;s playing with water .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
the only architect of the ancient world had no concept of dna on the dna , but they had a concept of the <unk> .
this is just a little bit of a little bit of the time , the obvious us in our past and present .
in this case , i worked with people working , the social norms , the social norms in question .
so i &apos;ve worked with people , who are the most common , two people in a body .
and as a consequence , his mobile arm was its <unk> , his brain was the most obvious male part of the <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , something called <unk> , which is called <unk> <unk> .
we &apos;re going to plan for the fact that we have to have at least our dna percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
typically our system typically , the idea that a certain common part of a particular particular identity is happening .
it &apos;s also true in terms of race , which is a lot more complicated than our <unk> .
what should we do with the fact that we &apos;re just going to differ by a few hundred <unk> ?
now , you might assume that the whole thing of categories had to make me really happy .
for us and it &apos;s an essential essential to the attachment of relationships and the care of the tolerance .
our ancestors had never been so hard to fight when someone was dead .
to realize that these are these categories really , much more than we thought , &quot; i &apos;m really interested .
this could be the evolutionary metaphor of him , &quot; you &apos;ll put it in the eggs . &quot;
i worked with people with people working on the <unk> -- so people who were smaller than common .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- nobody was doing something .
women , like men , have something called the <unk> .
for for heaven and humans , life doesn &apos;t live life from teeth and fear .
the first time i was in my view of the original <unk> , and that &apos;s why .
it &apos;s not surprised that these destruction of the human rights is the survival of the other .
we have the people -- love -- love to play their life .
first , a <unk> on <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about <unk> .
the secret is that the game is the key to this skills .
and i had to explain the journalists that there was this test .
so here we see a young female and males in a <unk> .
i think it &apos;s just like i think it was not true .
so <unk> are common , both at the time , people are in human beings .
so to give us a lot of a world , we need to play .
and a consequence of the body evolved the body , the rise of the female .
when the child &apos;s born , it looks like a girl .
okay , just a quick example of a <unk> of <unk> .
so we have a lot of our culture a lot of different ideas about <unk> .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
and it &apos;s really me about what &apos;s going on in terms of democracy .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happening with the <unk> of the world &apos;s population .
if it &apos;s barely exactly the same thing , it may be a bit of the <unk> .
under a hat , i &apos;m going to tell myself the story of anatomy .
and as general , we can use the word word .
and the <unk> are <unk> , which is <unk> hormones .
if you don &apos;t even feel more , you have to get buried .
most of my activities , i have two of my activities .
and so the testicles are really going to be the <unk> .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s been trained as a girl .
in our energy , we &apos;re going to see all kinds of <unk> areas .
we &apos;re seeing this in all sorts of different areas of human life .
and we &apos;re learning and the rules of the game .
but will we make the best from our <unk> ?
now , imagine that for a moment .
we make <unk> and we &apos;re talking about <unk> .
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
play is the <unk> that we &apos;re <unk> .
look at what she does .
in other words , play is our <unk> .
so two cards , every <unk> a baby .
we &apos;re going to come back to these people .
so , a lot of testosterone , but no response .
you &apos;re in the back of your body .
he had a extreme form of a <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why it happens .
so , sex can occur in lots of different ways .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
<unk> comes in many of different forms .
so we have this horrible <unk> idea .
but the game is a <unk> .
they &apos;re both <unk> , both of them .
game , not just <unk> .
and this is what you call .
who are these relatives ?
game is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
yeah .
thank you .
for example , for example , the <unk> of the <unk> , that says that that &apos;s a difference more important than the nature of the world , and said , &quot; we have a lot of <unk> and <unk> than the difference is not a big enough that we should have not the right to have the right thing to have , the right to have the right property , etc , etc . &quot;
we don &apos;t have the situation , as it is , in iran , where a man who &apos;s being told to other men is being told by death , because he &apos;s ready to be a <unk> to speak , which is that he can stay alive .
so the their students were extremely valuable to find out how individuals were in the state of the state , it &apos;s possible if we can get more mothers in this concept , we more <unk> , not just how to connect , but how we can &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m also going to look at that , i &apos;m not sure that we should be on people to be the way that i have to say a series of <unk> , which is probably more likely to make a lot of people that i know .
so , you know , because you &apos;re thinking that he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t have to tell you that he &apos;s the <unk> , because you &apos;re driving , it can be made , you know , you &apos;re going to have to worry about that &apos;s not a lot of people .
and to the question , what are the questions of we do , because what we &apos;re going to do , because our science is doing this in the world that we have to be able to say , a democracy that is a democracy that &apos;s based on anatomy , which is a social impact ?
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have to be able to have this value -- a surgeon that i talked about a couple of years ago , who had a few <unk> to make them , to separate them , consider a name .
what we &apos;ve learned from <unk> studies is that women , in average -- not every but not every , but in the average -- more complex complex social relationships and the people in the group are very attention to giving a lot of attention .
but when i was <unk> with him , and he asked him why he made these <unk> -- it was up to <unk> , was his answer , that in his country , these kids were very bad , and so he had to do it .
and i &apos;d like to say something that is a person something is radical , and i think there are different kinds of insights that are different by different kinds of anatomy , <unk> when people are doing a <unk> .
just because of the fact that a lot of people were born in the <unk> , they &apos;re all kinds of all the kinds of things -- the right to be the right sex , to the right to actually be able to drink the right .
so for example , at a point of point , texas , a point that you would have decided to marry a ridiculous chromosome , and you have to marry a woman , you know , you have a y chromosome .
years ago , when i was a graduate student , i asked me one of my favorite <unk> who was my interest in the age -- i looked at myself as a guy , so it was a really fun question .
that &apos;s what we should do , which is , in average , how female brains of the male brains are <unk> for us to do social relationships , and to worry about the <unk> of the relationship .
i want to suggest that i &apos;m probably probably a lot of <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the more powerful decisions of your relationship to be able to make a different relationships in your sexual relationships as a <unk> i know .
and perhaps that &apos;s where we go to the future , when we &apos;re going to democracy about anatomy , about about the individual body , to think about what identity is , and more about the individual .
while i do that , i &apos;m going to share with you some of the lessons that i think or not , from this <unk> , not to wear nothing .
they were the notion that people who had political power , they should have political power , because the <unk> of the <unk> from the grandfather to the son and so on .
if you look at the story of the female , it turns out that many of you are interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went away from <unk> <unk> , and so things like a serious concept of power , back , where the transmission are on a very <unk> of the <unk> .
if we look at one of the nation &apos;s first democracy , dr. / king , he &apos;ll say , &quot; i have a dream of a &quot; a way .
what i know is that it &apos;s really important to think about the idea that the u.s. is in struggling to wonder thinking about the democracy .
and part of me , what would be be , if the content would be something that would be something that could be done in the future -- could be made by light visible ?
i meet all sorts of great people , my dollars for usually a good purpose ; i &apos;m quite unique ; i look at it quite unique ; i &apos;m looking at it in my own personal personal .
and one of the things i really found is that the difference between men and women in ways they think about how they think and in the world .
and i didn &apos;t have heard of me as the woman who &apos;s here at ted in your underwear -- is that i found a couple of things .
of course , the problem is that , and we start to look at all the similarities , we &apos;re beginning to ask ourselves , why we &apos;re going to be certain <unk> .
i love to take a chance to opportunity to find a different <unk> , to find a lot of time , and to photograph and to even more and to .
it seems like our culture a way of thinking a sense of a , &quot; well , we need to pull a line , so we &apos;re going to pull it out . &quot;
the united states is provide an incredible opportunity to allow people to be able to change the they are , without they &apos;re going to change the state of the world .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve done , i &apos;m going to make a very public table , and that &apos;s what i &apos;m obsessed with .
he says we should not be people in the <unk> , but the quality of your leader , but after the property of your &quot; , &quot; and that &apos;s what you go out of anatomy .
this whole cycle , including the clearly , had a little bit of the most clearly , and it was the most amazing piece that i &apos;ve ever had in this whole week .
the old night this idea was back and they put it through a new <unk> concept , and this concept said that all people were created by the .
so imagine that one of you , is a <unk> , <unk> , three months of <unk> , so she &apos;s one of the time .
it &apos;s not a matter of the fact that you can &apos;t be the same exactly the same right , which is the case in all the states , and that &apos;s right to marry .
in our own society , we have our right job , and i think we would do our thing in the future .
i have a lot of i could find everything else i might wear , if i was just going to be able to get through palm incredible .
next is the successful civil rights rights , where we saw people like <unk> <unk> , who said , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
they <unk> the mit and decided that feynman &apos;s missing , not the differences , not the difference , and it was very radical .
and i want to think about the possibility of democracy , or did it , if we have more involved on the more of the people .
and sometimes i think people like me , i think , i &apos;m playing games , or i &apos;m going to hear them in their daily .
and to have to go to all this , not because he actually got another biological age , except by the birth of his birth .
i don &apos;t want to give science , but at the same time , it turns out , as if the science is doing power .
but the more i said about his question , so more i thought there could be something more <unk> in the lower .
so , if we try to do a people &apos;s connection , we think we can think about what we can do .
so there &apos;s some of the other people who are making sense of me , and i think , i think , should keep it .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we are , and why are they make sense .
for years , because i was interested in <unk> , i &apos;ve been interested in the research , i &apos;ve been interested in research in the research .
i come back back to my suitcase , and i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;ve been here at ted week here at ted .
i spent a lot of my life to try and be trying to be , and i &apos;m adapt to the same .
now , you did this part , because it was part of a <unk> system , which was two things in common .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should be the right to give you informed sex to do your informed consent .
and i said , &quot; well , do you have political policy in a rather than a surgery , instead of making them ? &quot;
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , you will not only understand it , you &apos;ll also appreciate it .
he , on the other hand , will be born to the <unk> , so he &apos;s at the one march .
so , in every state of nation , a woman can marry , but <unk> can be married in a few states today .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story i &apos;ve told you about the <unk> .
we find men in the <unk> of the <unk> , who say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people have colors that are common on common ground at common differences , and again , successful .
all right , just to finish , i want to show you that i &apos;ve talked very much about the fathers .
<unk> allows me to reduce the influence of my <unk> on the environment , and also the end of my wallet .
and if you look at the temperatures , you talk about nature and the god nature .
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the kind of question i &apos;ve ever ever heard .
and if you think that they don &apos;t look good , you &apos;re probably right .
they didn &apos;t have that way , but what they did for us was great .
if you think you &apos;re looking good at something good , it &apos;s almost certain .
well , i want to leave you with some of the things that i think is happening in our culture .
so let &apos;s get back to those two beings who have been <unk> .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
in the cover , it &apos;s about stereotypes about gender , so that &apos;s why the zero is not .
it &apos;s almost quite impossible to be bad at being <unk> , if you &apos;re wearing <unk> .
so we have these <unk> <unk> that are very many ways to be in many ways and cash .
if all the answers , i feel like i &apos;ve won .
and for a week , everything i did in my suitcase is doing everything i did .
democracy has grown up , but at the same time , too , also the science of science .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of it , they did a concept that was known by the <unk> .
i want to give you a fish for example , like a fish , not the same rights .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take a distance by the anatomy .
and so , when we think about it , we have a interesting situation in it .
he said , &quot; tell me what the older is . &quot;
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day day day .
we have two creatures , both the middle of the middle of the same day .
i get all my clothes out of second hand for <unk> and <unk> .
and so they &apos;ve been really quite a way of the future rights .
so how do we actually ask the question of the character of character ?
so i &apos;m going to show you very closely what i &apos;ve got to do .
we find other people &apos;s rights for what their rights are .
but a lot of people are in a very strange position .
now , people are actually going to test people in the hands .
i mean , what does someone do with so many <unk> ?
i &apos;ve come seven of them , and that &apos;s all .
and i want to show you my favorite <unk> for this week .
you can almost look like a little bit of a 50 dollars .
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re making other people .
i &apos;d like to leave and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to get to great .
they &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
i &apos;m a <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
they moved into a <unk> concept .
but how do you do that in practice ?
so i think we need to be a private .
i mean , what do i find today ?
they had a concept of blue blood .
we see the same thing in the <unk> .
how do you take people to their <unk> ?
it turns out it &apos;s really difficult .
do we really want to go to this ?
and there &apos;s no way that we don &apos;t exist .
is it less than 20 dollars a cost ?
just be , who you are .
girl : hug your child .
let &apos;s start with the sunday .
i call that the forest &apos;s mind .
monday : color is a little bit .
birds : there &apos;s absolutely <unk> .
thursday : confidence is the key .
so what happened to that ?
and women who have successful successful .
but i don &apos;t give you anything new .
will it be my size ?
will i be the color ?
so where do we go ?
ooh , thank you .
does that good ?
thank you .
now , now you want to win a race , you know , something like this , something like this , a few hundred sensors , a few thousand sensors , and the information that information is going to take information into the system , and then they process , and then use it to make the car and make things in real time and things in real time .
my colleague on mit , <unk> <unk> , could give you a lot more about this , and the many other amazing things that you can do with , but i want to talk to you the second part of the second part that we and that &apos;s the most important thing that we &apos;re going to do .
and what we did was , in fact , a new kind of network that was used around the world -- this is a <unk> -- and environmental and <unk> information from this network that &apos;s going to be collected by the brain to understand how the city works .
you know , when he &apos;s the world &apos;s wish , it &apos;s called the guy on the end , and it was , you know , you can still see a little bit of <unk> -- and she said , &quot; <unk> <unk> ? why don &apos;t you see ? &quot;
now , if you take this image -- i &apos;ve been originally , i &apos;ve met a remarkable in italy with this image in his room , but the reason why i &apos;m showing you this is what i &apos;m showing you in the formula for the last decades .
so we started working with some volunteers that we have to do something more than a year ago , in seattle , to either set up things that they &apos;re seeing -- different kinds of things -- things they would throw away .
or you could close the building and the whole architecture , like this , you know , this is a day , if you put the roof , you get pictures of people who were there , and say , &quot; you have the building . &quot;
i don &apos;t have to do this stuff , because the corner will be a different , <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be a different <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , that i &apos;m just going to do a little bit of the heart and it &apos;s a little bit like a little bit of my heart .
imagine you could have a little bit of the little , through the air , and each of them with a little bit of a little <unk> with a <unk> light that can move around the space .
you see the image of the image of the <unk> , where the long time the time for us to go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the one of the end of the day .
the other thing is that we think that if we see that every day that the cup that we &apos;re just going to throw away , not just that you &apos;re still on the planet .
no longer a building that would open to you , but a building that still had and holes in the water , you had to be without being brought down without <unk> .
and that was , very exciting , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , think about how people are doing things that we design .
and finally , saturday : a own , unique , unique style , a great way to tell the world to tell you about a word , without having to say a word .
it started with a question of the <unk> who came to us and said that spain and <unk> have a beautiful tradition to use a beautiful tradition in public space .
and one of the ideas that were in in mit was a <unk> , and they &apos;re taking these <unk> <unk> , and valves , <unk> , working and close .
a lot of time ago , when you wanted to win a formula , then they took her budget , and they put their money on a good brother and a good car .
it was always been coming over and over again , when i was coming up with me , just because of what i was wearing , i had amazing moral .
well , this is just an example of how we can feel the city , in a way that we couldn &apos;t have a few years ago .
and you can go to him , and it &apos;s open to open to you , and you can see it &apos;s going to be on the picture .
if you believe that you are in the inside and you &apos;re a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing that you can &apos;t carry .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like any one of the atoms out there , a sensor and a <unk> .
another example of this is a different example of feeling : this is not about people , but we use things that we use .
imagine a imagine a imagine the one you saw earlier , completely at the other way , completely the same .
or , &quot; but in three dimensions , what changes the light is not the position of the position .
and as a computer in free , they start to feel in other ways , they become accepted and driven .
but by the way , i want to mention that cities only two percent of the earth is going to be there , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population is living there .
some of you will remember it was a italy of france , and then on the end of the end , the <unk> .
this is a map that you &apos;re showing to show you the chips that a single day , and how they came together .
and here you see me , when i tried to test the sensors , the sensors that opened the water , not be <unk> .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn is to take this week , that it &apos;s okay to go back .
so we actually designed in this project , some small <unk> designed to track the garbage , while it &apos;s going to go through the system .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you &apos;re going to turn it , it will open up and make it go .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s taken from two parts -- a <unk> part of a matter of a <unk> .
now look at what happened on this day , just the activity of the activity that happens .
all the kids from <unk> came to the building , because the way they were playing with the building was different .
this is from a exhibition , the grand thing for a year later , during the summer , in the summer .
then we have the little beach , the little ones , the little bit of the garbage and to track it .
and if it &apos;s reading , if you want to reduce the end , you can even keep the roof .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the physical <unk> of water and the water .
and this is what we &apos;ve got to think about this about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
the next day , went to the center to the center of the prime minister and the prime minister .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in <unk> , spain .
no , you don &apos;t have the building , it &apos;s just that architecture is almost away .
and that &apos;s the beauty of making things to create things that are used to be used with people .
you can have a kind of <unk> screen or display , like this -- a <unk> formation in two dimensions .
i &apos;m going to show you just a few examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and not to make it happen .
now the first project i want to show you is in fact , is in the fact one of the first of our design .
if these <unk> are , you can write on it , you can write patterns , pictures , text .
imagine if you could just put the screen in different or different <unk> , in different ways .
over the cities , all of this detect and and the objects of life in objects .
well , all of our objects , our environment , start to speak to us .
well , i should tell you what happened one night at night , as all the sensors did .
and when the car and the rider was good enough , then she won the race .
our cities have been , in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .
but it was only when i was 30 , i really understood what that means .
they &apos;re 75 percent percent of the <unk> -- cause to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
and that changes the interaction that we have to bring people with our environment .
now , today , we start to answer the environment , to answer us .
and if we &apos;d show that people , then we can move a different way .
we should be able to do everything we want .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> fit to everything .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;ll get this all over the time .
so , when we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost as the old dream of regret ...
used to be the first day , people here and there are calls and moving .
with this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system .
and the question was , how could you technology technology to do new technology with it ?
what &apos;s interesting today is that the <unk> is in our lives .
well , in night , everybody went to celebrate the center .
and the plastic that we &apos;re still going to be every day every day .
and we got the mission to create a building in the painting .
you see the person who &apos;s going to ask what &apos;s happening in inside .
this is what we call in our lab , <unk> design .
<unk> , which is people make a short call , go on the bathroom .
we can do the same things in fact , with less energy .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
if we &apos;re <unk> cities , this is a big thing .
you see in the middle of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
now , we know about this , we know about things where we are .
but we know just a little bit about where things are .
it &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> with water from water .
but actually , it was a little bit of fun .
imagine that this <unk> could actually start to fly .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all of my tiny suitcase .
i have something that i &apos;d like to show you .
think about this as a flying cell , as <unk> flying .
this would be you , in <unk> , a <unk> .
here &apos;s the results we &apos;re getting right now .
but that &apos;s a lot of <unk> and more complicated things .
france makes a portal . italy is a private .
and i &apos;m going to take this short for you .
let me tell you a little bit about this .
the summer was a little bit happier -- 2006 .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
well , we &apos;ve been <unk> <unk> .
here you see how the building works .
it &apos;s called &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot;
let &apos;s start with the point .
it emerged recently , three years ago .
it was as a italy called the <unk> .
and anyway , it &apos;s the end of the end .
second <unk> : the end of the normal thing .
<unk> , in a moment of the <unk> .
we called it the digital water system .
the roof was also covered with water .
they &apos;re going to be in the computer .
on the morning , before the game .
the game starts -- silence .
the data was not available .
all the building was out of water .
but the reality is always growing .
you can play with different kinds of different ways .
good day , everybody together .
you see the city .
you see the <unk> .
they saw the big one .
and then all down .
it was very like it .
you can have this cloud .
thank you very much .
first , second .
heart wins . yeah .
here &apos;s the video .
after a week .
thank you .
thank you .
from seattle ...
so i went home and ate my wife and i told her , &quot; well , i went to my wife , if you could use your eyes to control , to control , you should find a way that <unk> a laser , to control a laser , so that he could make a long time , that he could be a great . &quot;
i called myself in place and a place to his brother and his father -- &quot; good , my proposition is that i &apos;m going to be a bit , and we &apos;ll be able to get a device , and we will find a way that he can make his art .
so the idea is , imagine that we do this with people to do something about the environment and the environment -- almost something like this , as we call it , <unk> , as we move , a cloud .
we took a <unk> , they put it on a <unk> , and now we have a device that &apos;s available to open , and we can build it , we can put it in the code , we put the code for free , the software can download free .
we worked with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the heart of the <unk> in new york and the <unk> in milan -- we &apos;ve got his movements in 3d 3d to use them as a momentum for the <unk> .
i met these people from <unk> , and <unk> research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to put a light on each other , and then we put it on a <unk> to draw on the negative surface .
i went to my footage of this <unk> as i would like to share my ancestors , in consciousness that you &apos;re in the individual moments of this way , and never again .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call it <unk> , because you talk with him , or a email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy &apos;s unbelievable . &quot;
but then that &apos;s just a 3d cloud of <unk> , which can be able to look at them and move through that way , and they can look around many , many , many directions .
today , we can take the first time -- and the campaign &apos;s actually shown that we can do this from the digital world , from the <unk> of the world &apos;s forces of the world .
but tomorrow it can be able to ask us the challenges of the time -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how we can then do the digital world for the physical world .
i just want to leave you with him and i said , &quot; wait for this moment , isn &apos;t it -- i &apos;ve seen stephen <unk> of this devices ? &quot;
so i came up with the need , just a check , and i put a check out , which i had not had the elected , i had to make it <unk> .
i was just holding a little feet away from the water , and i was just wondering that that one was a chance to be a another , year , year .
and he was back to the first time , in the <unk> of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a sense of a feeling was on the parking .
but for over two weeks , we &apos;ve been talking to the <unk> in venice , my kids have been in , and i &apos;ve got to have this .
i think the remarkable thing that the last few years , the last few years , the last few years is that we &apos;re making a physical world to a digital world .
you can actually look at it from the bottom of the most inspiring moments for <unk> and <unk> , and it &apos;s kind of like the connection to the community .
i have a company , which is design and and how , so , a whole thing is a complex part of what we want to call and watch .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and much , and we &apos;ve reached some things .
first , we have the <unk> of the kids , and actually have a device that &apos;s going to communicate for a device that communicate with -- a <unk> .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought in the <unk> of the <unk> , a little bit of a little bit of the <unk> and a few things out of the and the <unk> .
and a kind of digital <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for everybody who wants to go to the top .
a lot of our friends thought that we were beautiful stupid that we were doing , and we all have the images of the walls were <unk> .
i have the feeling that i was going to put in underwater , and finally , someone would go down to the bottom , and i can breathe with it . &quot;
if you look at a fake , you think you &apos;re isolated , and you &apos;re just like that , and just like we often see people .
my wife , my children and i went to the garage , and this hackers and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
and after a year , two weeks of planning , two weeks ago , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the first time for seven years .
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;ve heard the higher <unk> , and a real one can really do that .
some of the things that are able to make and move up to the neck , while others , it &apos;s no more <unk> and a very <unk> passion .
you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat has gone up to the other side , the man &apos;s guy .
but then , once we all have all the time , you can play with it and play with paint motion .
the cloud is a cloud cloud , in the same way , as a real cloud is a cloud .
it &apos;s not a death , if you pick up ; it &apos;s not a end of your <unk> , but a <unk> of your <unk> .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you , show you a piece of that i &apos;ve been in <unk> in <unk> .
because it &apos;s a problem that someone who &apos;s going to have to do it in it , not communicate . &quot;
and also , seven of seven of the world &apos;s entire world -- literally , from all the parts of the world -- to us .
at the end , he &apos;s got a email with the content content , &quot; for the first time for seven years , i &apos;ve been doing something .
it could have any individual <unk> , which is from people , from the way of people , or so .
so the idea is that we actually have people with people in which they do things together , collective .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something at the top can go , how the new <unk> can go .
by my work , i &apos;m thinking that people are not separated by nature , and that &apos;s all connected .
it starts with the <unk> , then the <unk> , then the <unk> , and the most people do actually make art .
if you look at the light , it looks like we &apos;ve seen it . so , as we &apos;ve seen before .
that can be , in our case , we use it to design and create a symbol .
and this is an extraordinary picture , because this is his life , and he &apos;s looking around his life .
and we also had to do this in the parking few times , and we were felt as part of it as part of the <unk> .
the first time i was at the age of 10 years ago , where i saw my first <unk> .
then one day , he came back from walking back and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs . &quot;
i met with his father and his brother and his brother and said , &quot; we will give you this money .
my heart left , i was <unk> , while i tried to make what was going on before .
part of the ice in the i &apos;m in the <unk> that i &apos;m very young -- a thousand thousand years old .
i love this image , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
so here you see a real <unk> , <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
please , you look at the shape of the substance and where he &apos;s at the <unk> .
but in the other , i &apos;ve been doing that , i &apos;ve got to do this guy .
they say that all the things that are going up there are a lot of life .
imagine that everybody can give a small license for a little bit .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on the olympics in london .
that &apos;s all of them , knowledge , and it &apos;s doing it through the internet .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud of a cloud .
they &apos;re born born as an than a single woman or a <unk> by <unk> out of <unk> .
as he <unk> , he &apos;s <unk> , water drinking water , which is many of the rest of the rest .
so we decided to go out and try to support tony -- and he &apos;s trying to support .
and his brother said , &quot; i want to be able to talk to tony .
on the left , you see the <unk> , the different <unk> of different <unk> .
and just like , you can tell you the one side of your personality .
my life is really extraordinary , and the work of a wonderful projects .
so we have created a device that &apos;s completely freely by constraints .
we have a local force against a wall of the hospital .
imagine that every single individual is being controlled .
it &apos;s a different period of london , but with <unk> covered .
he &apos;s about 120 feet of the water , or 40 meters .
i &apos;m <unk> , &quot; very <unk> , how can that be ? &quot;
now , you can actually communicate alone with your eyes , or drawing in your eyes .
so the end of the two weeks , we went back to <unk> room .
we &apos;ve got his bed to see it &apos;s going to look outside .
that &apos;s why we keep us and we can keep moving forward .
this is what we want to use as a function of the <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project we work on .
they can move inside and different kinds of experiences .
they interact in ways to make their environment and their experience .
while a fake truck , i &apos;m going to put his <unk> atmosphere .
and one of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
and i said , &quot; how do you know ? &quot;
did anybody see the film out and see ?
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description .
this is what something built in the city .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually actually using an <unk> of a <unk> .
on the left , you see a little boat .
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> of the 1980 .
that &apos;s how they communicate -- so your fingers are moving .
so i was talking to a conference at a conference .
so they &apos;re going to go around and make them like this .
but there was always a cycle in her slow .
so there &apos;s all of these <unk> in the large .
i want to show you something here .
it &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> .
so they can be able to realize the whole movement .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
as artists , i think , is very important .
normal people don &apos;t have these devices .
you can do that all the time .
each one has his own individual personality .
but the truth is far away from it .
this is the average size of a <unk> .
and that was the standard of the .
it can only use his eyes .
thank you so much , that was incredible .
this is something like our <unk> .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
and this video is real .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
this is <unk> dancing .
here you see here .
now , <unk> is completely paralyzed .
no <unk> can &apos;t .
his name is <unk> .
i was interested in it .
isn &apos;t that ?
you can get to .
i &apos;m not talking about .
thank you .
that was incredible .
no hospital .
thank you .
thank you .
we have this <unk> , and we &apos;ve got these things that we want to do in life , and i thought to all the people i wanted to do a hand , and it didn &apos;t work , all the time i wanted to do , all the time i wanted to do and never
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was when we were the george washington bridge , so pretty much <unk> -- because i was thinking , human , there &apos;s one thing i really &apos;m really <unk> .
and this question should be asked , every single day , which will you have to be done , if you don &apos;t have to do , if you do , if then , if you don &apos;t ? and if you don &apos;t , who ?
i had a drink , i had a mobile , and i was so <unk> , and i was in california , and i found a little bit -- and then in the 1980s , i found it was a work for <unk> .
so my call on all the people who are now going to imagine the same thing on your flight -- not -- but imagine , and how would you change ?
the <unk> thing is -- and this includes the whole circle -- that it &apos;s all the april , the <unk> <unk> in the city of los angeles , a show called &quot; the <unk> of the &quot;
i &apos;m not a french , and i had never had a little bit of <unk> , but i just did something and i with amazing people , so we could put together something on the legs .
but if we do that , a effective <unk> on a laptop that is used by a <unk> , to put these gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
and just as the woman who had to learn me as adults , she took me to put her a box of a box and got into my hands .
we found one thing , and we took them , and we took them to take them , and we gave them eight of them , because it was necessary .
the only thing we knew was very , very complicated , what the most complicated part of the part , the most part , he made made of <unk> <unk> use of <unk> .
about three or four years ago , i received a call in the night in the night , a teacher who said , &quot; i have to see you .
now , if we &apos;re working on the systems , the systems of the <unk> and the total control , we can actually do a lot of problems with the population .
armstrong &apos;s <unk> about us and then , in december , the <unk> was <unk> , one of the 50 grand inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it was a circle -- and the contrast of that i &apos;ve talked about was .
and there are probably the hardest century of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- all these these boys are going there .
and you can come to harm , and please come to come to with the man who i know you &apos;ve found it .
the third thing i learned -- and while the inside the body is <unk> , 13 , 13 , 13 , ...
i realized that i was doing the dots , which is that it &apos;s about a great father that it &apos;s about a great father .
the <unk> our attention and we started a project project that we were going to have a <unk> project in which we were infected our environment with <unk> .
everything in this room was not -- this stage , this computer , this computer , this , this microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible .
so i looked at them , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve caught some birds . &quot;
when we started our research back to <unk> six months ago , it was completely unknown what the sense of purpose was .
i was the one who was in the <unk> green and blue , until a teacher got my life .
we looked at them , we said , we &apos;ve got , and we knew they &apos;d be in a hospice .
it needs to be the same -- he would love to love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to us to give those things .
imagine a click of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
in my own humanity , i &apos;m my mistakes , i &apos;m going to be better , i &apos;m going to be better in everything that i &apos;m going to do .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s in the &apos; 60s , in high school , where i was the <unk> .
and i should say i &apos;m going to have a <unk> , and i want you to go ahead . &quot;
while i was thinking about it , i was a saying to me a minute that &apos;s , &quot; i &apos;m not taking a bad piece of bad . &quot;
the <unk> will be in the gray box , and the <unk> and the iranian <unk> will be in -- pay .
<unk> was <unk> like a <unk> that didn &apos;t love our cheese -- <unk> , but not to eat it .
so basically , if you see something that is impossible , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , it &apos;ll be possible .
well , a chain is something that you find , because you get somewhere that you get out of it .
he needs the truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that the day that i &apos;ve been hearing this is .
and i &apos;m the time that i &apos;m going to make a lot of things , and i think , with people who mean .
more than everything , everything else is my only purpose in life , a good father .
i was one of the other gift to see in the future , and come to live .
and then , when i thought about it , i decided to make the same energy , i was able to do this for the rest of my life .
i don &apos;t want this thing to be in 20 parts , as you know it &apos;s known from a farmer .
and that really does a mind really , in a thought , is that i &apos;m just a thing .
what would they do for it because they think they were always doing there ?
you can have me as farmer , or in leather , but no one has ever been elected farmers .
i could see it in the eyes , there was a living to end .
i want to share three things that i learned to do about this day .
i &apos;m not trying to have right ; i &apos;m making myself to be happy .
so one month after a month after i went to a trip of my daughter -- <unk> , not much more sophisticated .
and more than anything , are you the best parents that they can be ?
so we &apos;re finding out how to do it better , faster and stronger .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that needs the rest of life .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard .
because when the wine is , and the person is there , i open it .
as we were , i had this sense of being , i was not getting the feeling , man is not .
and i say people always want to come and want to come up with a scientist .
imagine a big explosion of the same time , as you &apos;re on on 1,000 feet .
well , i had an unique place to do that day ; i was sitting on <unk> .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
these gray boxes are not running through <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
and someone who has a <unk> , deserves , much more .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably in america &apos;s most america .
she saved my life by making the toilet in the <unk> .
the pilot had the machine , and we were not so far away .
the most important post there is the development of nuclear weapons .
and it seemed to be something like that , with these gray boxes , these <unk> boxes .
it &apos;s the kind of more circle of the i want to tell you about today .
i &apos;m a lot that we never learned to be a adults .
she saved my life , and my partner , and i have yours .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it comes to a <unk> .
think about it , it &apos;s free , none of us .
so they were saying , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
and that urgency , this goal , changed my life .
almost like that , we &apos;re going to prepare for life long .
i was not going to be the miracle of that day .
the gray boxes you see here are <unk> .
<unk> is going to be part of the show , which is pretty much .
you go around the block and take it as a failure .
the revelation is that death is part of the life .
i was the only one who could talk to the <unk> .
but i &apos;ve been given my own space , i &apos;ve given my ego .
i didn &apos;t have my wife anymore anymore with my wife .
i only wish i could grow my kids .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy ?
the idea behind the <unk> is a pretty simple .
since that time , we have all of the kinds of recognition .
the pilot put the machine machine to look at the actual river .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i said , &quot; please , &quot; please go into the air . &quot;
and i &apos;m <unk> , i like a little kid .
and in the world , everything has a sense of me .
we don &apos;t want to build the bomb .
i &apos;d like to tell you how we &apos;ve found that .
and we need to improve a lot of work in this device .
today , i want to share with you about the piano and stories .
one of my friends did it -- richard <unk> .
well , the next day we were in desire .
it was something we knew to do .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
make it possible -- you all of them .
imagine a airplane <unk> smoke .
imagine a <unk> airplane .
i didn &apos;t need to talk to the <unk> .
i never want to do more in life .
it &apos;s all from our own pockets .
and i had to go away from town .
two minutes later , three things later .
he says , &quot; <unk> to &quot;
and that &apos;s the planning by <unk> .
we won &apos;t be won .
this is a painting of a circle .
she did it for three years .
that &apos;s not the route .
so we start with a <unk> .
that &apos;s a bit like , right ?
he &apos;s powering the boat .
i had a good life .
it feels great .
you can see the water .
but it was very sad .
and then something was happened .
they did it .
this sounds fear .
you could see manhattan .
thank you .
not .
thank you .
thank you .
really , some people , and i &apos;m sure that chris anderson , <unk> and <unk> , i &apos;m sure chris anderson that never been to me -- the <unk> of the talk that you just see at the time , which had a title , and not a lot of content , and not many evidence of what the subject would be .
so what you got was : your tedtalk is : my tedtalk , which you don &apos;t have any idea what the subject will be going to be , and you would look at the content to fly the ears , especially if i took their company to their <unk> .
so i actually have the most part of my career to do <unk> , and that &apos;s all for trying to do the world , and we &apos;re going to explore it in a way that they &apos;re interesting and interesting , and hopefully in some kind of way , what they do for the audience and make accessible for the audience .
so what happens to the <unk> <unk> , is that everything from the top to the bottom , from the beginning to the end , completely connected -- by the <unk> , the <unk> you see in the film , which is the brand .
as i said , i said , in some of the years , i was going to have a pretty terrible situation , but there was nothing to me , but i could have been able to go to a little bit of so hard and so i can walk with these guys in a room .
what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attack was actually beginning to get it slowly and then stop what &apos;s going to happen to you to try to make it happen , so that you can &apos;t get to be able to get out of the way .
now what this thing is that it &apos;s that it &apos;s the human values of sensors -- so for example , from <unk> and <unk> -- and it &apos;s a <unk> code that &apos;s still available to the attack with the wrong data , the wrong data .
to make these brilliant , we call it in memory , that it &apos;s definitely <unk> <unk> , it has to be a <unk> goal , and very likely , it &apos;s in the iran , because there are most missing people .
the most the most important car they were ever been called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; the greatest drink , they have ever had a attention of &quot; the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so when i knew that i would come here to go here to a tedtalk in the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i &apos;d make something little different .
so , the books really my interest , and we started working around , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
i started to scientific literature , and i found out how these <unk> in <unk> are built in <unk> , and found that they were going to be in artificial <unk> , and they were <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> active active in the gray box , when a special field was discovered , and even , if the case that the special program , which allows it to be trying to do this in this goal .
and if you &apos;ve already noticed that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the <unk> are a science for yourself .
and i spent 30 days doing nothing than this -- in the beginning , a little bit of difficult , in the middle , very dangerous to the end .
what i &apos;d like to do is a film around the <unk> , marketing and advertising , and the whole film is funded by <unk> <unk> marketing , marketing and advertising .
and i called them and <unk> her knowledge to the <unk> , which we had in the code and the data .
and if you get this speed of this brain , you can actually actually the fact that you can actually start to the the fact , and even even the consumers go .
so the idea is to show besides what &apos;s a number of life , actually , to get them to the film ?
and then we went to <unk> and <unk> and tried to get the real world in connection -- with potential in the real world .
the little <unk> over the <unk> is a <unk> , and <unk> the robot and the <unk> and the big <unk> <unk> with six <unk> into interaction and economics .
and you don &apos;t have to be -- the the the the car -- you have to <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> little bit like we &apos;ve seen in <unk> .
but we &apos;re not going to be able to do the brand x x , but we will be sure that we &apos;re going to sell every possible category in the film .
so <unk> and <unk> we were the <unk> code , and found that it was very digital <unk> -- a smaller and a larger .
if you had asked me this year a year ago , i would have been able to say to you with my mind .
and we also realized that they were very passionate about people who were obviously <unk> , they had all the information information .
i spent the last few years , to put in a place that normally normally , and i think it &apos;s kind of hard to do with it .
i &apos;m going to put a couple of <unk> , some of the <unk> , and i gave people the way to my own tedtalk to <unk> .
but in the new project i &apos;m working on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
but anyway , we found that both both the same survey in reality and the same goal , but it &apos;s a different different way of different .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; i gave me a list of all the experts for <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
so in a power power , if you open up the big fast , you have to open up within the new field of time , you have to open up .
and after we were dealing with various kinds of bad , i went to that this is a <unk> attack .
so , in the large and all of that , we &apos;re really confident that we have actually determined what the goal is .
so it &apos;s just like in the <unk> , where the <unk> is <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
so , it was a lot of it was that people think that the <unk> is the <unk> the <unk> .
some of you may have heard that i was a <unk> a couple of weeks ago on ebay .
it might be , for example , we &apos;re going to be a <unk> leader , or a <unk> of the country , or a <unk> in germany .
so what we were looking for , was <unk> , because we were <unk> , because we know what this makes .
the great digital <unk> -- we realized a glimpse of the very specific data and <unk> .
here &apos;s a really cool stuff that we discovered -- actually , actually , i &apos;ve got to be able to make a little bit of the humanity .
and so , the film is going to take this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in the case of bottle , for always ?
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart , that code .
so , it was possible to get the little digital <unk> in the way that we could do with the <unk> .
the the one is in the process of the population , these black object that you see .
so for example , the number <unk> is very out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
so we might sell a shoe , and he will take the greatest shoe you &apos;ve ever had ...
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals might be made by <unk> .
so he would be doing exactly as well -- in a power power , or a <unk> .
there &apos;s only one , and these are the united states -- for happiness , happiness .
in basically , it &apos;s turning out to the <unk> and <unk> in <unk> .
we need digital design where a human <unk> can &apos;t respond to enough fast enough .
so unfortunately , the largest number of goals for not to be in the middle east .
i think of the <unk> is involved in the process of the driving , but the driving force is not israel .
so we needed to have that we could make a lot of these goals that we could make or reverse .
there &apos;s the gray box there , and the top , you see the <unk> .
and this gave us great confidence for that we &apos;re looking at .
now , you don &apos;t get me wrong , that &apos;s not just that .
and often we simply ended up in a breast and we had to collect ourselves .
the idea here is obviously not just the ones that make the <unk> inside the inside .
we have to ask the consequences , and we &apos;re better at the time .
so , this warning , i knew that anyone would buy the <unk> .
these people will be connected to the film in the classroom -- for always .
it &apos;s much more than anything else that we ever seen .
and in fact , this false data is <unk> from <unk> .
and if the risk are , they can really happen terrible things .
and if you do that , you get a <unk> <unk> .
thank you for being a <unk> <unk> . thank you .
but even apart , it &apos;s a very good opportunity to do .
and the movie is called the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and we &apos;re actually showing you the whole process of how it works .
so we should better figure out what the goal is .
they were all of the bits of things they had to attack .
now , in this area , there &apos;s not a few thousand goals .
and not the <unk> , the <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be shown .
he &apos;s got nothing to do with <unk> , with <unk> .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all of these green areas , these are the <unk> environments .
now , this brand , the <unk> , the <unk> center .
these <unk> in iran are divided in 15 so-called games .
and guess what we found in the <unk> ?
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human <unk> .
this is the consequence that we have to ask .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
and if you don &apos;t , it doesn &apos;t matter anything .
here you see here &apos;s a clip from this <unk> code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines , about 15,000 lines .
these results were getting hard to do this by several weeks .
the idea is to make a digital <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to say now .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
you could also use the ordinary technology to the same .
you have to have it as far as possible .
so the driving force is the most <unk> superpower .
i was in <unk> -- hard and dangerous .
do you know how many people look at this tedtalks ?
it was &quot; in love , &quot; for always . &quot;
they even did the <unk> of the <unk> .
it looks pretty much like the <unk> .
so , it &apos;s made sense , it &apos;s all together .
so , again , that &apos;s really good .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
in fact , it &apos;s a lot of dangerous and scary .
so , this is what we need to do digital digital .
because it would be even more even bigger .
i &apos;ve worked on a research -- dangerous .
that was not a sense of my eyes .
okay , you want to know that ?
i went to jail -- hard .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
completely specific to a particular goal .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
by the way , this is just the <unk> .
and that worked very well .
and it &apos;s better .
but it &apos;s getting worse .
is that true ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more to the smart .
so they knew everything .
a very same structure .
the power of power can explode .
i have a question .
this is scary .
it &apos;s <unk> .
yeah . okay .
a lot of stuff .
thank you .
but there was only a company that was a civil willing to help us -- and that &apos;s because i had john medical and richard <unk> for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to leave the <unk> and to the companies to go to the companies .
the problem : transparency -- free -- free and <unk> , just to discover and <unk> ; it &apos;s also to information , and the access to information , especially what <unk> -- the last line is the biggest problem .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world where you lives -- like people around a table , the friends , the family , the way you live in life , and that &apos;s how people live and work .
see , when i was a kid , and my dad was looking at the room -- and he &apos;s sitting there , and he &apos;s looking at me with this looking at this -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three of every three versions .
so what you started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that , if you start to talk to these companies , the idea of your brand is being a stronger problem .
especially in the world , in this interface , in this sign of new media and the media media media -- is it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting <unk> , that &apos;s how the masses of this news is .
and i was confused , because i thought , all the concept of advertising was the idea of advertising , your product as possible to present as possible as possible .
so when i started talking with the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want to tell you that one story .
and my friends , the big , high <unk> , say that the reason why their films are so successful , the way that they have been successful .
have you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use a point of view , because it has a negative <unk> -- but you know , how does this change ?
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s worth it , some really exciting ways .
i think , &quot; <unk> &quot; is a great word that this category really makes something positive , unlike opposed to lake and moisture . &quot;
i needed somebody who could be in my head , someone who could really help me understand what you call the <unk> .
and then my friends say that little bit of <unk> , &quot; well , how do we do with these big , giant <unk> ? &quot;
whenever i do , i &apos;m doing , and whenever i open up the <unk> , you &apos;ll see see you &apos;ll see see see the <unk> .
now , we can &apos;t be the <unk> , but i often see me at the interface of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because i heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
we &apos;re going to be both for men for men and women , <unk> , or a little bit , whatever .
all of those things and start from a place and for me , and they start with me with my family in west .
it turned out that it meant to be , &quot; we want to have nothing to do with your film . &quot;
see , when you &apos;re transparency in the <unk> , this is one of the first pictures that &apos;s being in this .
i have friends who are great , great <unk> , and i have friends who &apos;s little <unk> like me .
so these things make -- you know , remember , remember , people -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
and every time i &apos;m somebody , i can say , &quot; are you alive for this interview ?
but look , the problem was that my idea was a <unk> mistake , and that was this .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera would mean that we wanted to lead a <unk> .
technology is not the way you should describe something that is going to be under the <unk> .
i think the <unk> , the style i &apos;ve got , is that i think , is , &quot; <unk> glamour . &quot;
tell me a little bit about how it &apos;s going to be with your thoughts and feelings of yourself .
who knows when the movie comes out , we see , maybe a lot of the <unk> .
but why ? well , transparency is fear -- like this strange bear , the still <unk> .
man : the brand i &apos;m , is i would say , <unk> fly .
there are your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
either &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> is &quot; <unk> , &quot; you will have the choices .
i have to talk to the man on the road , who are like me , <unk> .
but i usually have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a jewelry and a little bit like this .
so as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a brand brand .
how can we keep them longer , better fresh fresh , three fresh , three blood .
so this is the whole concept of the whole film , from the beginning .
and i would be happy if i would help you .
but is it a difficult thing about the film , or a difficult thing for me to be ?
our politicians say , our president says , even our our students say it .
but when it comes to that , it &apos;s going to be something .
you would be a brand , if dan would be a classic real real .
you know , i &apos;m going to be <unk> , partly , significant , part of the world , i don &apos;t know .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to discover this <unk> .
if you look at people who are doing it , you know ?
if you could do it , they could help me also help me .
so my lord , you can help me ? i need help .
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version of the true version .
now , i can answer all your questions and give you a <unk> <unk> .
what does that happen to the thoughts and feelings about yourself ?
and just so , all of these companies , one after the other .
maybe you should have a little bit of a interview in front of that interview . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , lots of <unk> and so stuff .
man 4 : my brand is in theoretical , because i was <unk> .
and what was noticed is that i needed a farmer .
i have this . the first picture is a picture of my family .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the film .
there are some places that we can turn forward .
but that &apos;s what this image is a problem .
you know , we &apos;re talking about a whole lot of transparency .
and the movie is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
it &apos;s <unk> <unk> , except in <unk> , except in the <unk> .
and so i found a company called <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
but i don &apos;t know how <unk> people are going to be .
how much money is it needed to do that ?
they didn &apos;t want to do anything to do with the project .
i like your kind of creative , just run . now .
so how do we see the movie in the movie ?
are you so far ? you see a little nervous .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other words .
what about me ? what about the average ?
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
what &apos;s next to you want to talk about .
the next thing . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what do you think of the answer ?
the answer is probably likely to be &quot; no . &quot;
no one wanted to have something to do with the movie .
actually , it was not the mistake that was not the mistake .
and then we &apos;re going to give one of these great <unk> .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
these are the people who shapes my shapes .
no , that was what i thought .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
i want to help you .
you should tell me something about my brand .
all right , so what is the brand <unk> ?
i sell people around the country , in the world .
so , it means not so optimistic .
which words would you describe them ?
man &apos;s three : i &apos;m the <unk> .
man five : brand <unk> <unk> .
you have your pictures , right ?
we have to think , what would be .
that would be no problem at all .
and it &apos;s also very remote .
a whole plate of cool <unk> .
we speak by the camera , fresh .
these things have a <unk> effect .
how would you describe your brand brand ?
i like to really like beautiful clothes .
ah : i &apos;m a <unk> .
tell me the world .
imagine the camera .
what else else is ?
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
that &apos;s a great question .
and this is a <unk> .
that would be okay .
that &apos;s very risky .
this is the <unk> .
<unk> technology .
it &apos;s just your fresh place .
yeah , my brand ?
brilliant . both .
i can help .
i was optimistic .
this is <unk> .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m tom .
five million .
is this ?
okay .
fantastic .
yeah .
unique .
many companies tend to understand -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- things that they &apos;re not sure , they &apos;re frightened , and they &apos;re calling them to avoid them , and they &apos;re actually themselves in something that is actually in fact , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
but it &apos;s been 17 to do that , who were willing to do that with somebody who wanted to do something like that , and the better ones , and we told them to tell stories that we don &apos;t have to have , we can &apos;t have to tell stories -- stories that would never help a
they <unk> us to tell the story of the story , as we tell the story in this movie , that you use today to use today &apos;s <unk> <unk> of the brain , and to advertising advertising and to make a films as films .
<unk> are things , the most powerful , fresh , fresh , like the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> like <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and agile , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> like <unk> .
i &apos;m a little bit , talking with some of the familiar , and i found out that it was a bit of a game called <unk> , which is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and that said , with role and transparency , my whole talk , &quot; the whole talk &quot; was sent to them from my good friends of <unk> , the $ <unk> for the <unk> .
i was doing something else in google months , and i was doing something else , and i &apos;m doing something with museums and art , and my favorite room that i &apos;m also going to have , i gave me green light .
i check my my pocket , wearing the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check in the $ <unk> , to fund my <unk> in the next year .
and the incredible thing for me is that the projects i had to get most of the feedback or where i had the largest success , or where i was doing with things right now .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their <unk> two separate two separate , but <unk> pages -- the previous <unk> is a <unk> / <unk> .
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies , and the <unk> were <unk> and the <unk> , and the no &quot; no &quot; they were not going to be part of the project .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project , where almost every <unk> , we talked about what we call your customers , the fingers of it .
well , there are <unk> and <unk> , these things that come and go and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty strong thing .
according to the <unk> , the was the consequences , and since then , it &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million <unk> of this film .
i believe that if you &apos;re trained to get your employees , you &apos;re going to avoid a profit , you &apos;re going to get to a profit .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they said , they <unk> the sales , and they said the perhaps not really their interest in mind .
one thing that i think is that if you have a chance to look at your chance , you &apos;re looking at that risks that are more possible .
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with this film because they had no control control , no control of the product .
i &apos;m going to work with him and something completely different , something that people think people will think about it , that our view of the whole way .
are you reliable , stable , safe , sure , ok , holy , and how the dalai lama or <unk> ?
i was told to be a great education -- i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t have to have a lot of my work in the room , and i didn &apos;t have any access .
and while i worked for google , i tried to solve this guide -- art , and technology -- with technology .
a lot of <unk> and stories , i can tell you , with 17 , very interesting museums , from nine countries .
those of you who are really interested in art , can click here -- but i &apos;m now going to do it now .
and we drove into school where companies are in their way in the schools , in all of america .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration of the demonstration , and you have some interesting things that &apos;ve been since the launch .
there &apos;s no poster in the entire city for five years , no poster , no <unk> , nothing .
well , based on the name of the transparency , what is the $ <unk> happening ?
and so i started playing around , and i realized that there was something about that .
just to give you the curiosity , i just pull out to you what you get .
and you can also see it here , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> from <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
well , because the film film was released , we can look at this .
and i think some companies are going to focus on a greenhouse , rather than both them .
if anybody would ask them to describe their <unk> , their <unk> , their <unk> , how would you like ?
when i went back and went to visit these museums , i started a lot of learning .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- literally , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make difference .
i think if you fail to prevent people , then you get closer to failure .
we need to encourage people to have not afraid to have a lot of time to do that .
i think my personal view is very simple to this slide and the title .
i even come to one of my favorite , the museum of art in new york .
so now i &apos;m a <unk> of a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
and a lot of people are asking me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion <unk> ? &quot;
... that &apos;s not a fear . in the way of the kind of web you are going to be ?
you &apos;re a <unk> ? you are something that your blood muscle is going to be in <unk> ?
i feel that we need to encourage people to encourage risks .
i went close to my own , and i slowly that kids actually actually do something .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; <unk> -- what does it take us ?
today , more than ever before , it gives us a little bit of a lot of a lot of common .
we then then a team , a great set of team , and we started this .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve called with the so-called <unk> .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to go to go to the way you can go to the whole .
are you something that you have a little bit of a little bit , more , more ?
are they all , , <unk> , <unk> , are like what politicians are ?
big data is going to be in the world for organizations in large ways .
i like things that are pretty , i like things .
what is the <unk> ? in the <unk> , are you currently ?
the fact , actually , actually , one of them two weeks of two weeks .
each of the great things we &apos;ve been in the way we &apos;re looking at the risk .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
if the museum has given us the picture , they click on it .
this picture for example , about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and i thought , &quot; well , that sounds interesting . &quot;
let &apos;s quickly jump quickly , and in new york .
why is it important to be <unk> ? what is the red ?
yeah , i don &apos;t know what it is .
we went to to school where the first <unk> banned banned .
well , finally , the film has a very large american organization .
be the fear of the name . they welcome the risk .
open the card , and you jump it with a click .
you know , they want you to go to the end of the beach .
so , in the previous example , it was about details .
a little more about them , they &apos;re not .
and i think there &apos;s almost one of them .
<unk> , <unk> brand . how your brand is ?
and how was that for you ? what it is successful ?
this is just online -- not press , no tv .
there &apos;s no even online online . no <unk> .
finally , the way we &apos;re going to have the fear of view .
<unk> , and <unk> , you &apos;re in this museum .
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be like .
there &apos;s a lot of crazy stuff .
and that &apos;s what these decisions did .
it &apos;s not a lot of other people .
you can go around all of these museums .
you &apos;re going to get two of it in two ways .
i love this guy ; his expression is <unk> .
so here we have , and this is the painting .
the best one is -- in one second .
tell me a little bit about this part .
we should put the bear in the cage .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
i like things that are different .
the first one is a perfect , apple .
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are they vulnerable and <unk> like <unk> ?
i &apos;m going to be with the artist directly .
<unk> <unk> : &quot; they &apos;re transparency . &quot;
thank you , but the best one is still .
you can very easily put it in and <unk> .
but then they really want to go inside .
another <unk> of mine , <unk> .
what else do you have through ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
or are they more like a <unk> ?
the film was not yet .
you go around and move .
you want to be the museum ?
this is one of the images .
now , i &apos;m going to show you this .
thank you very much for your .
yeah . . well , good .
it &apos;s really good .
what other words do ?
that &apos;s a great question .
and it took 18 months .
i grew up in india .
so you just go to <unk> .
just on . much fun .
this is all the local .
you see something fun here .
it &apos;s why it was quite popular .
my name is <unk> .
i see this <unk> .
thank you .
go .
and what &apos;s going to happen to you is a <unk> area of our country , which is what happens when we leave a <unk> of our country , a part of the american message , and when people go to work under the canadian , or the one of the canadian <unk> , or the united states , can you work , and can you go on the surface of this messages , what do they want to do or to go to canada or america ? &quot;
they knew that every year about every year after all of the united states , they wanted to leave you in the united states , and they wanted to do what you could do to make sure that people can stay in their country and the same thing .
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i &apos;m going to do some kinds of weird things , but then i get to do all of these things , and i hear it to make all of these things , because i don &apos;t want to do it , or , frankly , frankly , they &apos;re <unk> .
we put the lights on , put it into a vacuum and <unk> it into a vacuum and <unk> it up to almost almost to go to almost , in the middle of the day , the piece of metal , to behave as it was .
it was worth for all of these year in the <unk> room , because , you know , the <unk> , the one single one , and that piece of metal is about just as much as the difference between the piece of metal and it .
it should be our goal to think about when families are thinking about where they are and work , you have to give them the opportunity to have between at least at least a hand of different cities that are all in the competition to be able to be .
some of us may have been for one of these extreme , but i think that &apos;s what most people do in the audience , in the audience , their brain , like a high high , which is a lot of the same time .
and if you play with your particles , you can do all sorts of weird things -- like you &apos;re going to fly directly through the fly , or you can see at the same time in two different places .
i mean , it can think that it &apos;s just a little bit of a thing to think about the same time in two different places , but they were born with this idea , they were not born .
and so i had to develop these new intuition that it &apos;s like all the objects in the elevator , actually , the objects in the fact are just objects that are <unk> in a small room .
but i bet that it play the time with the <unk> , a very valuable lesson , which is , the big things you don &apos;t want to let is go back and get it in a place .
the <unk> of <unk> objects are not only human , but the light that seems to be on it and the wind that you &apos;re going to have to put in the wind and the heat of the space .
it &apos;s so that these connections , with all the things around all the things around them , literally define who you are . and that &apos;s the <unk> and the quantum mechanics .
instead of being there , it &apos;s just sitting there , it &apos;s like it was <unk> , like this -- like a <unk> and <unk> , and it &apos;s like a <unk> and together .
and so i look at one of the individuals , in common , most of the other experimental <unk> that are a good good logic to make the complex ideas .
in that we gave him a little bit of a little bit of the time , we could not move to the same time , and not to the same thing in quantum mechanics .
so the first case : all the the atoms are out of the metal , the middle of the middle is still there and the same time , the same atoms and down .
so if a single one is going to be at the same time at two different places , can be this piece of metal in two different places , why not ?
that means that every one of us are in the same time in two different places , which is that the entire piece is that the entire piece is in two different places .
but you could go to a whole new place , create a completely new area , the laws of the law there would be such a construction and not .
you can do everything that &apos;s going to be sent to your friends , and so you start to think about what you feel , if you look at this look at these points .
so one of the most recent people you have developed over the years is that one thing can be at the same time .
because if all of these particles are made , and all these particles are following the rules of quantum consequences , should not just be the rules of quantum mechanics ?
so i proposed to governments that governments create new environments that make enough space for a city and give them a name : <unk> green .
and the most fundamental question is , &quot; did you have this to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
so i would feel better with all the things that feel like we could have , that <unk> , the rules of the quantum consequences .
and so we knew that when we wanted to see that this piece of metal was <unk> , we had to have the whole <unk> of the whole <unk> .
when we put it on the ground , the light was <unk> and the box , and we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece .
imagine that half of the people who want to live in their homes , they &apos;ve already been , but not the other half .
but you know what they would be doing in this environment and their environment would have failed to avoid the and avoid the traditional .
through improvement , and through the study of consumers , i tried to try and reduce this complicated concept of the <unk> city to use the elements .
and later , i found out that , in fact , the same time , the same time , and the way that we &apos;ve been thinking about the same time , and the problem of a global deal .
so we go out and play and look at it , and then we can start to develop it , and then we start to develop our intuition .
for the last time , i had to build my own machine -- to be this like a <unk> pool , and the thing that was going to be a little bit of a <unk> fire .
this thing has has been the ability to be <unk> in the <unk> , but it takes a slightly help to do .
very simple , you go into -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of the -- you can see it &apos;s a <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal , and it &apos;s like a paint , and it &apos;s about the edge of the edge .
there are billions of people in developing countries which are not even a city that &apos;s going to embrace them .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws , the laws of the law , the determine that you can &apos;t have <unk> .
each of them , everybody -- at least poor or poor , whether they have a big house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
that &apos;s the left half which is the individual side , and then the rights is the side of the side .
it would be a real model for a <unk> , because it &apos;s not a little bit of a play , but it would be a little bit of weird particles .
in the next <unk> , the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of the united states , which is a lot of us , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
i think , finally , i think , is the main thing that all of the wonderful things here are not coming from google .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to be created with this digital medium of art , and they &apos;re going to represent them in online online .
this was the status of physics , a few years ago , and you took a few times of the little , tiny particles .
so , imagine , they would be at the same time , at multiple places , would feel like that ?
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more than it costs them .
you can go back and online your own museum -- from all these images , you can do their own collection .
i was a <unk> space with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours in all the big devices .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of any of the brain , we could make your brain .
that &apos;s not the intuition , and it &apos;s just because i don &apos;t have to play with the particles .
i &apos;m going to put this image of my photograph , and i &apos;m going to see this , i &apos;m really in the hot .
this is the first object that you can see that in the <unk> .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics is , everything is connected to everything .
in 2007 , i decided we should think of <unk> as we should think about economic development .
so we could do the world with <unk> , maybe a lot of new cities .
now , this sounds may be a bit of the same thing , you know , if you had never thought about new cities .
and what if you want to see how van this problem is , &quot; do you create ?
and this is a great <unk> model in the world , so long they &apos;re not <unk> .
and so they all did all this knowledge , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be more in two .
how do we develop that intuition ? well , we love it with things .
he was a bit of a failure , and he was not very good at it , and he was always looking .
but you didn &apos;t need to be able to describe the great everyday objects around us .
so i did this thing that &apos;s going to be a way of doing this computer chip .
what does it mean for a object at the time , and not to be there for a object .
so i made a couple of years ago , to do this .
how would your mind do you think your body is in the room ?
it &apos;s not as if you &apos;re both , or you &apos;re so .
but at the same time , we need a good basis to actually get the experiments .
i remember , i remember a kid playing a kid on a <unk> .
you know how it <unk> it in a full wing ?
and they just start building the machine against the cities .
well , i &apos;m sometimes playing with you , but not very often .
here &apos;s what i &apos;m doing . we &apos;re looking at here in the center .
and here &apos;s a really big drop of this little piece of paper .
i mean , this is just what my hand page says .
so it turns out , as a very difficult way , it &apos;s very hard to do all these major .
in the meanwhile , i was going to be asked to do a talk at tedglobal .
there &apos;s a lot of other , but i &apos;m not doing the time .
for instance , this is one someone who &apos;s completely impossible .
now , where do you see your brain on this scale ?
i don &apos;t see any reason why it should be .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see that green dot there is .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
you could try to push the capacity of the already to the existing <unk> .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called the human .
this is the <unk> &apos; <unk> , in the <unk> .
they &apos;re coming out of my own .
look at you , let me give you an analogy .
so quantum mechanics says that <unk> objects are also as likely to feel .
we found that it was really moving .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about is really what &apos;s happening .
there &apos;s more behind that , it &apos;s deeper .
right now , we &apos;re far from that goal .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
you go into <unk> . you can really go into this .
this is a <unk> , probably never seen that .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but my logical approach has not been liked for that .
in 2009 , a lot of 2009 was suffering in a serious <unk> .
he would be <unk> to be his <unk> .
now , i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
this would be someone who &apos;s completely intuitive .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
and i &apos;ve never seen it .
let &apos;s think about atoms .
only to give you some accurate voices .
the rest of the time they are <unk> .
now , that &apos;s not quite right .
i should not say that .
they can be spinning and intuitive .
basically , they &apos;re doing the same thing .
this is a picture of the object .
and then we did that .
so we have its energy .
they come from the artists .
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
i created one .
thank you .
thank you .
real .
but in fact , we see it more and more and more and more , and they &apos;re ready to be rid of the <unk> , and then there &apos;s a increase in the <unk> , it &apos;s going to cost the cost of the r ; and there &apos;s a improvement of the <unk> ,
so the tedtalk in very much simple shape is a city city that is a place that is beginning to be a place that &apos;s the <unk> , the laws that are there and the people who are able to determine , either those rules , or not .
now , in the world of the <unk> , i think one of the best examples that recently came to the market is something that has been the best for the <unk> , something that has been very strong , it &apos;s a program that is offered at harvard .
and the realization of president of the was that the west of the <unk> that i thought was thought of being a way to get rid of the foreign commitment of the city and build this city for all of years and informed for many years , that &apos;s been under and universal suffering .
the leaders of government leaders were reduced to help the help of <unk> , could be from their their <unk> to the <unk> of the community that will be the relationship for this community and that everybody can actually be .
i &apos;m going to share with you a study that i &apos;m with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we have the decisions for the retirement period for almost a million million of about africa in the united states .
the main thing that we think of is that we may enjoy this vast amount of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , but we can &apos;t use the and can &apos;t choose the anymore and then can actually choose something from the fantastic .
so i have another one of facts &apos;s lecture , which is a graphics that has this kind of thing that &apos;s trying to realize that if you want to make a lot of a value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
they had had 250 kinds of mustard and gas and and over 500 different kinds of gas and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time we actually have <unk> .
immediately , for this choice , between the 21st and the war of february , a delegation of about 30 <unk> in the two places that were most most of the world that were most interested in the business of the <unk> .
well , not to buy a glass of <unk> , probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for us -- but it turns out that we have the same thing that we &apos;re going to do in very much more comfortable decisions .
many of them are fathers who are forced to their families to actually be able to <unk> , sometimes , it sometimes be mothers who have enough money to make money and buy food .
and i used to be this graph to show how valuable <unk> is a place like new york , and remember , that &apos;s a area in some cases per square per mile .
when the success company <unk> her 10 / prize , they <unk> their prize to <unk> , they realize that the win smoke -- one result of the , the increase of the production and the cost of the cost of the cost .
so , , please , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , so my first question is , is , are you ready to hear something about the problem of the game ?
that &apos;s what i was asked by the president of failure , which was that we need to do this project that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way to get our land .
we &apos;ve got six different kinds of <unk> <unk> , or a different <unk> of <unk> , and we have two things : first , i know , i would be able to stay out more people and try to get more people and try to try and do it ?
and what we were looking at was whether the number of <unk> were able to do a <unk> that was possible to make the difference , the <unk> plan , which is more likely to be saved .
so what i want to tell you today is four simple simple techniques -- techniques that we have to have different kinds of different and different types of information -- they can actually use their business .
but it was a really interesting discussion to be at one point when there was a pause , <unk> <unk> , &quot; paul , could we look at the tedtalk . &quot;
and shortly after the 19th january , they did , they had to be the for the order of the larger for the larger to have a <unk> , which is an special <unk> .
now , if you look at the extreme extreme , the plans that two government , they had a <unk> in the 70s -- still not as high as we want .
there are many of the ones that would love to be in america , especially in a place with a <unk> , and there &apos;s a lot of people who would like to live there .
so i decided to go to the driving , and i asked the leader , &quot; how does this model you really work on the model of this really possible question ? &quot;
so the people who decided to participate , they were more likely to have the more powerful more tools , the more of them and choose them and choose them .
the head of the dance came to stage , and said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you very much for your talk , but might we look at the tedtalk .
and these scientists have simply documented the different subjects with this one and with the <unk> and how to make these decisions to make decisions with the issues .
well , if you were , if you were , the people would be more likely to be a glass of glass , who were six to choice , when they had to choice in the ground .
i loved it to do it ; but at a time time i asked myself , well , how did you know that you &apos;re never going to do anything ?
and unfortunately , sometimes children who try to find their parents , they have to have some cases that they haven &apos;t seen in some cases .
so what is it for an idea to do that every family has a choice between a billion people in competition to be able to be a new community ?
so i tried to convince the <unk> of this , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with a field of at least a little bit of <unk> .
everything you can see in this picture has been built within four years , and it has four years to get the test .
i &apos;ve been a a recently with 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions , the average number of choices , the <unk> of a day is <unk> .
so , from the people who were standing as six , now , we saw that 30 percent of them actually did a glass of glass .
now , in the last 10 years , we have the negative negative consequences that makes the offer the more choice and more choice .
but the most effective supermarket , which is today the most <unk> supermarket in the world is <unk> , and they &apos;re only using molecular products -- a kind of <unk> of common in a tumor .
we &apos;re very new technologies , but for the progress of technology , we need technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually the same for us to be .
now , turns out , if you &apos;re involved in the way you have to choice , even if more choices have , it &apos;s negative consequences .
in a country that &apos;s just a very intimate crisis behind this <unk> for this <unk> <unk> for this <unk> .
if i &apos;m going to give you a question , you get it , because i &apos;m blind , just the hand , if you &apos;re going to burn some oxygen .
when i was a ph.d. at stanford at the stanford university , i went to this very very very very high ; at least he was really really .
it &apos;s more people standing there when they were 24 , about 60 percent when it was six percent , about 40 percent .
and what we found was that the more common community was given that , indeed , the most expensive rate was expensive .
not to those extreme decisions , to the decisions that people would recommend people , if their future is important .
when the <unk> and <unk> the different flight and <unk> of 26 percent of the age , they experienced a increase in the cost of 10 percent .
they had been talking about 75 different of the other , including the ones that were in boxes , who came out of a thousand years old .
a country has offered its top of their top , as a dish for the <unk> of the <unk> system .
around the world , there are millions of people who are waiting to make them to make place in another place .
this is a picture of the city , and the trip is the new airport that &apos;s built in <unk> .
there were the possibility of a city that was in a very city , instead of being hundreds of miles away in the north .
it &apos;s been working on a system that allowed allowed to participate , and it &apos;s been working on a legal system .
they choose to do more things for things that they ask less less , even if they make a objective .
i tried to make sure that are cities are going to be like much more valuable than they costs .
this is a picture of a large , new center , which is in central africa , in the center of the brain .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
so in these plans , we had about <unk> plans that were allowed to make people between two to the other between two to another .
they heard it before , but it was never true than that , that less is less .
i was asked to come to <unk> and even get to fourth fourth and fourth grade .
you know how many decisions are you meeting at the nine minutes at the time at the time in the hour ?
and he showed the <unk> of tourists that came every day and they &apos;d usually have their cameras .
people were standing in the world than they were , three percent actually had a glass of glass .
in the consumer that nearly 60 years , the <unk> , the <unk> now was now on the <unk> of the <unk> .
they &apos;re going to pay the decision -- they &apos;re going to be their own best interest .
so what is it a idea to think about it in a whole new city , to build a whole new city ?
and then recently , recently , a study with a local group , they started to have a week for a week .
the more options they were available to the more they were in the same , they put their entire money in pure .
and i &apos;ve come to the second that a new city will give people new opportunities .
and they &apos;ve found that a average &apos;s largest <unk> is busy with <unk> .
to become part of the national , it has to be twice twice by the congress .
so if you &apos;re in practical , you know , it &apos;s where we are today .
they already have a <unk> ; they already have this area for the second city .
one thing you already know , has been already , already , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
or even <unk> of these cities , or hundreds of all around the world ?
and then we saw that in which people were more likely to put people a glass of glass .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even when we &apos;re against our own best interests .
it &apos;s only about 12 percent of their decisions that they have an hour or more of their time .
today i want to talk about one of the largest <unk> of our modern modern time .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala <unk> <unk> the link to the tedtalk .
at the 17th , the morning , he was born with a second to a voice .
there were two cities in china already and the third is in preparation .
so we decided to do this experiment and we chose to <unk> for our experiment .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s just present the rest of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december of the <unk> of a hotels in <unk> .
the other place that &apos;s very special in the world is singapore .
a million people left to be extinct and <unk> in the united states .
how good , do you think they &apos;re going to make the decisions ?
and what we found was that there was a context .
you know , the average <unk> today , you &apos;re going to do products products .
so i &apos;ve been asking to me , and they &apos;ve got the tedtalk .
and a new city also includes new ways of leaders .
my friends have to ask me , thank you , thank you ted .
do you know how many decisions do you do in a typical day ?
you know , how many decisions do you meet in a typical week ?
fifty percent of their decisions have been done in nine or less .
they make more more cells -- even financial and , and even medical decisions .
people are always worried when i say , &quot; quick . &quot;
each of these issues , of course , many of these things are many , many smaller decisions .
i want to talk about the problem and some of the sorts of things .
we &apos;ve got a little <unk> directly right at the center of the <unk> .
each single medical employees now automatically automatically at a <unk> part .
all parties , all of the <unk> of society , that &apos;s all .
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
it was a shop , the <unk> .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they always always always getting rid of them .
and this airport has a area of 100 <unk> .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
a typical company will offer you today 100,000 products .
i have him on my laptop . &quot;
so the theme of the day : save save .
that &apos;s more than a thousand thousand tomorrow .
and also , and <unk> are very interested in .
they had <unk> <unk> different kinds of <unk> .
we are in a field .
this picture is from this place .
they even bring it to a .
think about your own decisions .
now we saw the real effect .
and again , it showed him .
they were in the least two .
it &apos;s a thousand thousand square square .
the place is very .
here &apos;s the oil gang .
here &apos;s your <unk> hospital .
we &apos;ve got all the <unk> .
first , it &apos;s .
thank you .
when i show you 600 bucks , and you put them in 10 categories , and i &apos;m going to show you 400 pictures , and i think you &apos;d have to show 400 pictures , and i &apos;ve given you more choice and a better <unk> than i gave you the 400 .
so we did that in a study that i did with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we have a study with people at mit -- they made a study with the people who have all worked for <unk> -- and those people were all in a meeting where they were their participation for their <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> . <unk> . <unk> . <unk> . <unk> . <unk> .
and in that way , we did this simple thing , there was a increase increase by 20 percent and there was a increase increase of the number of people who were willing to save or to go to a increase by four percent in the amount of people they were willing to pay for .
i told you about four techniques that the problem of <unk> -- the problem of the <unk> -- -- they &apos;re going to be the <unk> alternatives ; <unk> -- we can better deal with more more categories , fewer ways ; we can get the better .
each of those techniques i &apos;m going to describe today is to help you to help you -- for you , you can use them for yourself , good for the people who are asking them .
it &apos;s about that people to understand the difference between understanding the difference , which is the consequences of the individual possibilities , and that can be felt that most of them have been <unk> and then have to be true .
the thing that we &apos;ve got to do is we &apos;ve got to have people to think of all the positive things that would happen in their lives , if you would save money .
the fact is that you were looking at the first time , the first time , more information than the second time , but i would be able to guess it in the second time , but i &apos;d be a real way to do it .
and it turns out that if you make it , it turns out that it feels a very good tool , so you can get people to save more .
it turns out that there &apos;s the <unk> and the bottom up in the northern area , the number of <unk> <unk> , the number between the different kinds of europe to the high school .
unlike the most entertainment entertainment entertainment , the participation is the participation of the community of this decade -- either by putting it , or something new .
it &apos;s also me in my mind , the big product i &apos;m going to do , and so i &apos;m willing to help me to be interested in this .
and now i &apos;ll give you a couple of seconds to read it , and then i please ask you to clapping , if you &apos;re ready to take care of it .
if you think that the left is the left , and you &apos;re going to be able to go on the right side , and you &apos;re going to ask .
what you find is that people who are taking the many of the people who go and keep the <unk> and they choose the <unk> .
and if you think about it , you know , you know , you know , there &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s been looked at four million times .
and she said that he would be willing to offer all the people in this audience , a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the most beautiful street in the world .
it turns out we can actually deal with more information than we think we have to be able to be .
if you &apos;re constantly <unk> the decision , it &apos;s called the thing that you &apos;re going to be connected , i &apos;m going to get you .
even though i choose the fact that i don &apos;t tell me about my preferences at the time , i think , still , still to me .
and the more we &apos;re more to be able to pick out the ones that are going to be able to practice the art of the decision .
but what we &apos;ve done is that we all have to do all our creative work , and we all have to be amazing , and in part of the world &apos;s culture .
it &apos;s important to do is that an individual or a group of <unk> had a certain boy , and a big audience , and so on the process of getting the process .
why are people spending 15 to 30 percent more than they &apos;re using a <unk> or a text card than one or a text ?
and during that meeting , we have these same just as the way they were always , just , we &apos;ve got a little bit more .
if you think that the left is <unk> , and the top of the car is the top right , and then you &apos;re clapping to hands .
and then this community was a community of people who shared this great <unk> and started talking about it .
and the first thing i &apos;m going to ask is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities of each other is different .
we all want to be <unk> -- studio , singer , singer -- when i was young , it seemed to be so infinite .
what makes me to the second technology that helps you relate to the problem of the problem , it &apos;s the <unk> .
the other half of customers are about the <unk> possibilities , four four , to the dirty <unk> , many ways .
half of customers are going to be the many possibilities , <unk> <unk> to the small ways , four to the most capable of four .
the ones that really want to make a choice will not have 300 drugs , not 300 or more .
the left on the left is jazz and the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
the only thing i did is the order to change the order of this information .
because i think that the key to the final path is that you have to be able to express choices .
today we want to talk about how video video , and then , why is it that it &apos;s all important .
again , it will only be a tiny percentage of the individual , and thousands of times , and it &apos;s a little at the cultural moment .
you know , as people say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to do it .
here &apos;s a german <unk> , who gives you the opportunity to do your car , your car .
last year <unk> <unk> this video that he had in front of his house in the park in the gray park .
this graph shows what it looked like when the video last summer was popular .
because <unk> <unk> are <unk> and new things , and interesting things , and show them a great audience .
michael <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of science , was one of the most .
and this problem is often often , if you look at the long bullet of all of these trials .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> at youtube . i look at <unk> .
and if they don &apos;t have to do it , they can &apos;t do their clients .
now these decisions are in the number of choices that they offer per decision .
what i &apos;m doing now is i change the order of the decisions .
now , before we started doing this , i had a conversation with <unk> .
here &apos;s for example , a study that we made in a <unk> .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the protein of a car .
like &quot; cats &quot; it seems to be a little bit of anything .
well , <unk> <unk> it up , and many blogs started writing about it .
it &apos;s important to the creativity that is in the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
the categories must tell the <unk> , not the selection of the choice .
go from the little choices to the many , you stay .
ugly <unk> <unk> the <unk> , the video , the video .
already in the first seven days there was a <unk> for every single day .
every one of you might be famous about the internet until next saturday .
because you &apos;re doing that as you &apos;re using a species &apos;s name .
if you want to know this : these other peaks are also <unk> .
all the ready is to make respect , you can &apos;t go to the ground .
because the categories of me can tell me how to keep them apart .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other one is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
they have to make a different decisions to make their own completely .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
if i &apos;m using the easy , i &apos;m going to learn how to do .
but at youtube , more than a hours of a mile , they &apos;re going to be a .
rebecca <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
we can deal with more more than more choices than more choices .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
now there are 10,000 <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; at youtube .
you see , cats look at the same video that you look at this video .
well , let me show you a little bit of this .
you knew it was a trick , right ?
so i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
<unk> , <unk> of the car -- i have a couple of times .
and this video has been already in the &apos; &apos; 30s .
but what about that day , this particular friday ?
<unk> <unk> &quot; is animation and music in <unk> .
i think i may have heard more hands .
because the pictures of it for you are feeling for real real .
three things : <unk> , <unk> and the unexpected .
it was almost 200 million times a year .
this year , it &apos;s almost 50 million times .
now , who is ready for this journey .
because it doesn &apos;t make us money .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
well , it was friday that it was .
and i &apos;d like to read you to read .
my fourth technique : it &apos;s a metaphor for complexity .
oh my god . oh my god .
in fact , i didn &apos;t really want to make a video video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
even cats look at that video .
it &apos;s all important . &quot;
this is a description of the street .
okay , there &apos;s a couple of things .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
who who &apos;s really like that ?
we need to get the complexity up .
motors , give up -- four options .
well , we want to do it .
he had uploaded a lot of <unk> .
what &apos;s happened in that day ?
it &apos;s very , very simple .
the third technology : <unk> .
here are two different types of dna .
okay , a couple more .
what do i look like ?
this is what the graphics looked like .
but you know what ?
how are you interested in .
let me sum up .
so how does this work ?
what &apos;s going on ?
there was a <unk> <unk> .
are you all ?
you lose them .
oh my god !
<unk> , <unk> !
there was plenty .
thank you .
that &apos;s true .
good .
<unk> !
how can i talk about the two minutes of women in the <unk> of a girl girl , when she &apos;s sitting in a small of of the country &apos;s life , and her mother &apos;s sitting in a small boat in a small boat in the chinese room , and her <unk> in the <unk> of a <unk> , a <unk> , and never ran up with this little girl , and never ran on this little girl -- this little girl , that now in san francisco and today ?
i wanted to take a look at the top and the top of life , a <unk> , a mother and two daughters , who had been every one of their days as 20 years of <unk> , by 20 years of telling each other , and the stories of their day , and we &apos;re going to do three of them in the same bed .
but i remember the lights on the lights of the coast of the coast , and in the young man , the end of the journey , and the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first <unk> of the first day , gave me one of the men in the platform .
express le le , <unk> <unk> , was now practical , and social career , and beyond the way that they were invited to be invited to be invited by which they had never heard and in , in our countries , they could never have imagined .
and i realized at the same time , that it &apos;s okay to be a dance , a <unk> , and not only , but something like that , but something you need to be grateful , maybe a gift of the <unk> .
i don &apos;t remember the tank that many times , many times , but from the <unk> of the men on our boat , or to the <unk> of the engine , the six hours of the engine , the six hours .
i was not really interested in being a guy , and i was told to a friend , i said to myself , this is a great video , which is a guy who <unk> for the <unk> .
i had to make sure that there was not free , and it was my job to learn that the story was trying to make us , we were going to be <unk> .
every dollar was given and became in more education to work with mathematics and mathematics , no matter what we needed to do . mostly were the new things that came out of play .
and so , no one of her husband &apos;s suffering was she made it for a <unk> , and she was in her own case , and a greater bigger <unk> than they won .
<unk> , creative <unk> , completely unexpected , the features of a new kind of media and culture , to each other , and all the access to the audience .
i got a parking , because i was not going to be the <unk> , but often there &apos;s a lot of the physics that i &apos;m going to leave you on the <unk> .
and these aren &apos;t the features of the old media and they &apos;re not too far at the media of today , but they &apos;re going to be the entertainment of the future .
my first memory is from this boat -- the <unk> <unk> of the engine , the clapping of every wave wave on the axis , the rise and empty horizon .
and the women came through with stories that were not the change , and mad and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> children , caught between two worlds .
i &apos;m now enough to know that , i went to know that , the world , the world , but not as much as you can &apos;t .
hold it up at the <unk> of the <unk> in front of the eyes , where he must have been able to have his life a single waste .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose life was to be from the simple hope of <unk> and freedom of his home .
in a world , every minute of a few days of being sent video , only in truly unique and unexpected <unk> as the <unk> .
and there were the rare but free <unk> of &quot; <unk> , &quot; and here &apos;s where i &apos;m going to go home .
a whole <unk> of the ground that we made it from a <unk> joke to something that we can do .
my mother was every night , but we were telling each night , and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house .
i met people in all the ways , so many of them did what they were loved , the limits of the .
because <unk> can lead to collapse , so that can lead to the point that you can make the assumptions of the environment .
my mother may be 18 , when her father died -- in a marriage , a little kid .
and it was my job to stay on every night , until their <unk> came to me .
in the other hand , i was in the intelligent life , the the <unk> of the violence , the <unk> of the violence .
i &apos;m a little team of people who are going to be the <unk> , and i &apos;m not going to get a <unk> challenge .
there was a meeting to the reconciliation and a calm voice , &quot; i &apos;m going to go to you . &quot;
she reminded me that i was now so old , as she did when we had the boat .
and although i was given , i realized that i could not be able to do a career in a new way .
she grew up in a time in the <unk> of the social norm and the west , the most important person was the most important person .
she asked the bridge , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of you are so cold ? &quot;
because there was a lot of surprising and fun , and it was really surprising to be <unk> , and his argument was about five times .
for her , she had a job for her , the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
in other than the most of the <unk> , that happened to me was not in the way that there was no <unk> .
and the <unk> of <unk> were <unk> were able to do the people who had a thing , they started to start .
most of our ideas were crazy , but they were a couple of <unk> , and we &apos;ve done the breakthrough .
and the next <unk> is the four women in three generations that build together together a new life .
we were at <unk> , one of the very <unk> <unk> , which is the population of the <unk> .
my mother was working on a <unk> , then a <unk> , a <unk> , six days .
&quot; it just said , &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
i had a little bit of my sister and i would have to take my own and my grandmother .
and i was in my last year , and i was in the last year , when a young <unk> of the year .
there was a energy , a <unk> optimism , a strange optimism , a strange <unk> of the humility and the <unk> .
i just went to a hotel in sydney , when she died . 1,000 kilometers away in melbourne .
as i said , one of the world &apos;s largest <unk> -- justin stands at the beginning of youtube .
after a teenager and <unk> <unk> <unk> , a boat on the lake , as a <unk> <unk> .
a few days later we went into a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat in her case .
who &apos;s have &quot; the &quot; have &quot; or &quot; or &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot;
two <unk> of school for the school , every one to do the holes in the other .
in one of the classical obvious to me , the classic molecular student was <unk> .
and i was born by a <unk> to the next thing , and the edges didn &apos;t get together .
at the end of a every day i &apos;ve got a huge field of solar pollution , which we shared .
so , imagine the first piece : a man who &apos;s going to make his brother .
the next <unk> shows how a boat in the early <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
like most adults on the boat , my mother wore a little <unk> .
so i spoke about <unk> and training , and i was the <unk> and <unk> .
they were going to find her to find the time , english and <unk> .
she was a <unk> , then she did a <unk> , and she was a business .
when she was at age , she was the second woman she had .
we told her stories and <unk> her that we had to be .
it was a <unk> to the <unk> , because she was going to be able to take six years .
before i &apos;m going to talk about the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
i looked through the <unk> and saw it on the other side .
and at the norwegian , the circle and he said he &apos;s the case of the .
now we &apos;re not going to see a lot of things , we &apos;re doing with .
i knew that she was going to be able to look at .
&quot; because she &apos;s going to be called it for the morning .
what &apos;s the computer community can be done in the way that these things are ?
this approach is true for everything we do .
and today we &apos;re feeling , we also have a reputation of our sweet culture .
the words , as long as his friends , he &apos;s going to be his .
the biggest fear had they were in front of us , rape and death .
the nuclear nuclear came out of the <unk> from the world .
my mother , my sister and i was sleep in the same day .
and the more i &apos;ve talked , the more should be more more .
opportunities that have no longer allowed to be .
three months later , i was going to go and the adventure .
and that &apos;s all of us to think of a big question ...
but our life are so much more than our memories .
it was so determined that she could fail .
after three months in a refugee refugee system , we went in in .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i met the decision to go .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s going to be .
my grandmother never never saved me to his life .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
but so many years of aid had help .
life has been not changed since centuries .
&quot; not &quot; was a <unk> .
my mother asked us to give her hand .
and nobody needs to give up the ideas .
he moved back into the silence .
he died , by the story .
all the adults were aware of the risks .
no apple has ever taken back to this .
my mother suffered from <unk> from the boat .
i didn &apos;t know about the <unk> .
there was one another more interesting to be .
a year , we didn &apos;t have a cents .
we worked on the night to the night .
her father died after her birth .
someone made a plane of this .
who would have been there ?
the story is not yet .
i never met it personally .
no one was never been a way .
her mother moved her to her .
and then it was international .
something more fun in me .
so loans and trucks were going .
so i got my life .
it &apos;s just a journey .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i lived in <unk> .
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
we were poor .
come back to ?
there were centers .
my feel again .
thank you .
<unk> .
so , by color , contrast and cell on the edges of the edge of the edge , arab feet , like <unk> , <unk> colors , <unk> colors and the blue , we &apos;re taking the borders between the different images and let &apos;s look like a picture picture , even though a picture is basically hundreds of levels
at this point , the patient comes into the game . you can &apos;t just take control of your own , free on your own ship , but also to help us in health care , the challenges that are facing us , and the health of health , the demand , and so on .
and there &apos;s also my favorite <unk> , so he can see where my <unk> is , and not just at the moment where i &apos;m going to support support , or need to look at the past , but also with a glimpse of the past .
we have a newspaper and a <unk> asked , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please , please share us where he &apos;s when he &apos;s going , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s going to be closed during <unk> , of course .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> , and somebody &apos;s going to use your iphone , and then you can use your iphone , and within the next few weeks , your life can save the next <unk> that can save life .
but that &apos;s what the <unk> thing can happen , because this is the <unk> , , to help patients , to help patients , because that might be used to be used against obesity , or it could be patient .
what we were looking at , who we were made and how life was made , we can now see the men who were in our lives , we would have come to the <unk> .
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues around the world , from other universities , from other universities , to help us move around the world , to the world &apos;s <unk> around the world .
but it could be used to be used by their heads , and they get to to get together in some way to control their health .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you really can really get , but i want to look at it as if you can have that , in a photograph .
so every morning i &apos;m going to go on my school and talk to people before i &apos;m in the car , &quot; for lunch , just a little bit of a little bit of a little , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and it will be the people to measure their blood pressure , to their doctor and to send him for a little bit more than 100 dollars .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew i &apos;d be going to have a couple of months to get them to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
so the things that look like a picture , i think , are the things we don &apos;t think about , things around us in our everyday life .
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main reasons , why all of -- maybe most of the most stupid people are : because we stopped listening .
can i give you a bug in your life , who &apos;s the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the body , the long horizon , nothing ?
i personally do that it &apos;s easier to create a place , because you don &apos;t have to go to a place , because you don &apos;t have to have to compromise with the ideas in your head .
it &apos;s not about particularly scientific -- it &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea , and ask the patients , families , family , relatives , &quot; how is it ?
i would draw it with my former spending for a little bit , but it was a little bit different , because the camera was actually in the process of planning .
i see you as a scientist of reality , where you can take different pieces and create a different reality to create a alternative reality .
and third is about making it possible to tell the individual images and end up by making them together .
and if you &apos;re in vacation and you &apos;re at your own job , or somebody else is , you can find a way of having a <unk> .
these might be <unk> , or robots like , for example , for example , that the <unk> of the still is still at its point .
but the end of it is about how we interpret the world , and how it can be made in a two-dimensional area .
but in a certain way , with each other , you can create something that still looks still looking at the way that it &apos;s exist .
but when we start using photographs , it &apos;s really important to think , because otherwise they just look wrong .
it &apos;s just simple : every time i take up to the scale , you send my data on google health .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies are helping us all over the world to help us the mental of these <unk> .
please help us and try to do health , not only to do it , but to take care of your hand .
or photos like this -- dark and <unk> at the same time , but all the common goal to keep a infinite level .
and from today , we don &apos;t just like this as a <unk> , as the product is called , but also as a <unk> .
so to me , it was really about to go to the real time , to be right at the right place at the right time .
and yes , i even put the house on the island of red to come out to be a little bit .
and i think the most important thing about this is that we stopped talking to our patients .
they &apos;re ways to use the easy easy , and they start to hug the team in the team .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process , the process , when you &apos;re onto the machine .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts to be when the process is going to be <unk> .
we have three perfect <unk> physical objects that we can identify all the way into a three-dimensional world .
so what we &apos;re doing is our brains , because our brain is simply not that it &apos;s not really makes sense .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to get a <unk> outcome .
yet , my interest began to photography when i first saw my first scan , at age age .
and if you make good shots , the result is pretty much , and it &apos;s quite also quite realistic .
so , it &apos;s all tools there , and the only thing that we &apos;re following is our imagination .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you through a quick video .
and these two pictures of these two -- from the same height , and the same height of the same thing .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve been introduced to the <unk> is , you know , a <unk> .
you might think that this is a bit of a landscape , and the bottom part is built .
to make a <unk> result , it &apos;s from me from me to my own .
but if i could give that , and you could be able to get it , i would do it .
we designed a app for <unk> , to reality , to find these <unk> .
if you have a band in our family , it &apos;s the women &apos;s going to be .
now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i still think of the boat .
because that &apos;s , of course , a picture that you can &apos;t be able to get out of his camera .
take some pictures where you think a moment of thinking about the trick .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s called what it is , but we &apos;re going to keep it for .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic <unk> benefits .
it will give this little <unk> that you put in a iphone or so .
and my little <unk> wants to make us to change , by the way , to make it ...
now -- we can just -- we just move away -- i just just just the video .
so it &apos;s more about being a idea , a really a moment .
but this picture is completely completely , from pictures of different places .
no one knew where the next was the next state of the next to this moment .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of bang , before , in front of me , front of <unk> .
so the first rule is that we should have read that all the same story .
maybe you might be familiar with me , i &apos;ve been on twitter <unk> on twitter .
and they can reach through these kinds of ways , but also by solving .
we know exactly where all of the pair of care are around around .
so , what did we do ? we did have <unk> in the 1990s .
and also , <unk> mother today , in the fourth or fifth .
it makes it impossible to say , the picture is actually actually a whole .
and yes , i have a job , you might see .
but where would the next <unk> to help this patient ?
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
pictures like this : a construction spread a lot of road .
but what is the trick that makes it look like ?
as you can see , these are not three special images .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
but at the same time we know that it &apos;s not possible .
it &apos;s really about changing different types of combine .
but then you can do something like this .
for example , the fish was taken on a <unk> .
this is my favorite . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
and over 10,000 <unk> have been told in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for the .
is it about the details or the color ?
so i think the basics are very simple .
and let me show you a simple example .
and i see the same process in the combine of photos .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
after that , it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
we know one of the things that are all the power .
and we want to get this to a worldwide scale .
if i say reality , i &apos;m <unk> .
and here &apos;s every piece of very good learning .
she &apos;s got a button , a magazine .
i have a job with a lot of years .
and a week comes on the market .
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
it may be , until it &apos;s .
&quot; they didn &apos;t have them . &quot;
secondly , have to have the same <unk> of the same .
the bank is from a different place .
we all have <unk> in our cars .
and sure , we can find <unk> .
today , i &apos;m going to have unexpected discoveries .
the defeat would have too .
who would ever be one ?
i believed everybody could do that .
but it has a unexpected mind .
and yet , a scary level .
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
the <unk> comes from a person .
how can we help you ? &quot;
and every morning i &apos;m on this .
and we have a <unk> designed to do it .
so , it &apos;s the sell for lunch .
is it the light ?
here &apos;s another example .
but it requires a lot of planning .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe in our phones .
i work in the <unk> .
i don &apos;t know .
is it even photography ?
what &apos;s the illusion ?
oh . a moment .
thank you .
thank you .
and that &apos;s when you all of your feelings about politics and the line of the other things that we &apos;re really going to do is we &apos;re really going to be the , in the core , in the middle of the words , from tim o o , &apos; &quot; what we can do in common that we
if you ever have the chance to work in your business , like our fellow scott <unk> <unk> as part of the program -- in fact , do you do this -- you can see that the people who are the government , the government , including a lot of different problems , including a <unk> in their house .
how often do we take a political leaders -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we stop back and expect that government , our government , and our needs , and then we don &apos;t expect a lot of changes ?
so a couple of years ago , i started to take a program in technology and design to get a year and work in a environment that &apos;s pretty much everything you actually hate , we have them in the government .
this is when he &apos;s looking for a dinner , but what he really is looking for is someone who he &apos;s going to be <unk> when he &apos;s because he knows , he &apos;s not very good at the <unk> , he &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
but it &apos;s this particular thing that we have to do , and we pay for , to be something that &apos;s going to work against us , something else , and then we &apos;re ourselves ourselves .
but more importantly , it &apos;s important to this app that &apos;s the problem of government -- the problem of government <unk> -- not as the problem of a <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up the internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you have to build the only building .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> area of the city who saw this , he &apos;s seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but to make the citizens of the citizens .
and because government finally is their power of us -- <unk> : &quot; we &apos;re going to take people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , how this change is happening .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , there are hundreds of people in the country that come up and writing the <unk> and <unk> every day in their own communities .
well , for those of us who have the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
but a particular fellow , a man named the <unk> , noticed something else , and that was the fact that the people would be freely <unk> freely , to share in front of that .
so a app that was written in a couple of days , and then <unk> <unk> , is a kind of a <unk> on the institution of government government .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open the doors in your house and open your home and see if the livestock is <unk> ? &quot;
the good news is that technology can make it , the function of the government fundamentally <unk> in a way that actually can actually achieve a difference by society .
and you would have them with no <unk> , if it was needed , but a neighbor is a very better and cheap alternative to services .
later , later that was told that if it was about the normal channels of the normal , it would have taken over two million dollars , and it would have been over over two million dollars .
it &apos;s a group of a <unk> that has written a very <unk> report that wrote a <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> .
do we really believe that we can achieve what we need to reach , without an institution that can be in the name of all of us ?
one day -- this is an historic report -- this is what i came to my <unk> , &quot; <unk> in my favorite room . can &apos;t tell you .
it shows how the government works better -- not more like an private company , how many people think they should .
there &apos;s a project in the very first place that we &apos;ve got the <unk> of two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at the collective act with the digital technology .
so if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care about their voices .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools that we need to make things in common .
and the next post we got , &quot; i went to the middle there , found the <unk> behind the house .
now the average of our resources is 28 , so i &apos;m , sadly , almost a generation of older than most of you .
we had a team that was last year in boston , for three people two and months .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i urge you to think about it because things are changing .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s about power , about the <unk> .
and then then seattle decided to use the app to use the citizens to get the citizens to the <unk> .
it was a way to see the parents who could find the right public school for their children .
and like many people , i thought it &apos;s about government , where people are in a particular office .
they &apos;re not fighting that battle that we all fight , who are going to speak ; they all are speaking .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about that , that government is not the same thing as politics .
we had a team of mobile school in boston in boston , in the &quot; code for &quot; code for america .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the <unk> for the design .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
they &apos;re just frustrated with her , but she doesn &apos;t complain about it , they fix them .
i &apos;m talking about a platform for people to help themselves and help themselves to other people .
that &apos;s because the government is a further ocean , and politics that is the top of the top .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 that wrote the teacher in the last year .
and chicago has just introduced them to the people who are <unk> when it &apos;s so <unk> .
this is the work very smart people in the office of new cultural urban <unk> in boston .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how government is going to get to the rule .
and most people understand that , but it &apos;s a <unk> of the other .
you can think of your mind every time you can at any channel , and you do it .
but what they really do is to show what today technology is possible .
it &apos;s very important that these work work work , but the people steal the batteries .
if you know something about <unk> , you know , it &apos;s not going to work .
but in &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; everything is public , so everybody can see it .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to make our hurt sexy .
this is a generation that grew up to see their vote for granted .
they use their hands to write applications that work on the government .
so he did what any good sign would do , he wrote an app .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called <unk> .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role .
we choose every year and we &apos;re going to work with them .
instead of send them into the third world , we send them into <unk> .
and he didn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the <unk> .
how did he get to look for this particular kind of particular ?
they were in the february , and it has a lot of <unk> .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can take a fire .
we know nine cities , who are planning to use this app .
and not even like a <unk> , but more like the internet itself .
and these people know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
i didn &apos;t know about government , i did this program .
you get out of your own , if you &apos;re in your city .
and they realized that the city never had this fire freely .
and what &apos;s the thing that is what we call ourselves .
this is not a political active , that &apos;s active active .
you &apos;ve got to imagine the enormous challenges you have to ask .
and there were great great apps that were working with urban employees .
you &apos;re going to put it into it , if it &apos;s <unk> .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take somebody .
the <unk> of software takes a few years .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
and that means free free , which means open and open .
the politics doesn &apos;t change the government is in change .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean that technical definition of the platform .
when a helps the other person &apos;s , we &apos;re our communities .
a government is absolutely necessary , but it &apos;s got to be more efficient .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do other <unk> .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and it has spread , organic , , of course .
but what happens to the <unk> <unk> is different .
turned out to be the <unk> . went home .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the physical physical .
let &apos;s call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
he &apos;s &quot; <unk> &quot; in the official database .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real becomes <unk> .
we have to make the environmental government .
al is a <unk> in the city .
today , there &apos;s a lot of people who have the government .
this is the case for the service and information .
but that was not the end of the <unk> .
that our business system is what we &apos;re going to do .
and we use this word with such responses .
oh , my time is ?
so there &apos;s a nice little bit of this .
and that worked . the scott for scott .
scott people fall up human .
<unk> ? yes . alive .
this is a little small app .
and that &apos;s not something else .
they didn &apos;t have the government .
boston didn &apos;t just have a click .
we didn &apos;t write this app .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
good night , cute <unk> . &quot;
so the <unk> did it .
it &apos;s moving to a lot .
so scott gets this <unk> .
they were these two people .
have you seen these guys ?
okay . thank you .
so al al .
and that &apos;s important .
they use their hands .
it &apos;s not ...
<unk> is ...
pretty simple .
no .
okay .
i usually , i &apos;m going to tell you how wonderful the new technologies are being told to be the most amazing , i &apos;m going to tell you what i &apos;m like , and i &apos;m going to tell you , and also try and look at what &apos;s going on , and what &apos;s really going on here , is that this is happening to the front of the new , which seems to be very rapidly , we can
the reason for that is , if i put it on a normal normal way , where i would say , this is the <unk> of a kind of <unk> , and that &apos;s a genuine effort of the technology that i want to be with a graph , then the graph is .
so the question i &apos;m here for you here is : when it &apos;s about the big , important things we need to do , all together , we &apos;re going to be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
that &apos;s what i did , i &apos;ve got this code -- the code is made out of normal letters that we use to use for the <unk> -- and i have written my <unk> on a piece of dna , and it &apos;s 10 times a little 22 times .
i also believe there &apos;s a theories that we start with how everything has been , but i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of a story of what &apos;s going on , which is that there &apos;s a little <unk> of these <unk> for chemicals .
and we know that there are right now not to make sense of trying to look at 30 or 50 years to look at the future , because it &apos;s so different , which we don &apos;t make sense of .
some bacteria have figured out how to go from a few bacteria and have this information together with other bacteria , and we have a lot of bacteria that are written on a lot of bacteria , because we can communicate each other .
now , this could be taken within the lifetime of a single organism , hundreds of thousands of years ago , because these information had to be learned by the individuals , which were not that these <unk> were not there .
i &apos;m sitting here and i &apos;m sitting in a <unk> sound song , so i &apos;m able to create a kind of fun idea in your mind that i have a certain idea with my original idea .
so they either either survive , or they went together , or they would have been successful , that if a community was successful , all the individuals were more and more and more than the evolution .
but then one other thing happened , very interesting , very interesting step , where things were different , and then we started to communicate and communicate information that communities were made of cells .
so these communities began to be , so the level of the stage , which was evolution , not longer the single individual cell , but the whole kind of <unk> that we call organism .
in other words , they have been able to figure out a way of a , in this <unk> , a way of making them , <unk> what they could get , so that information could be stored and copied .
the <unk> is where these communities are so close to the same community , that they &apos;re going to write the recipe for the whole community into a <unk> on the dna .
so a organism was to learn to be a certain planet , not eating , because she was bad and sick , the last time he had her .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers who are willing to pay and pay them and pay them to get their hands up .
so if i want to look at another technology , we &apos;ll say , a <unk> , then , that &apos;s going to be very <unk> in the <unk> , in a little line , in the same line .
so if a hundred million people would like to have a hundred million people in this room and even for everybody in this room and even for everyone in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , like this slide , like the other one we often have in our field , is a kind of just one of the only ones in our field .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> , and so on , all our primary mechanisms that we built in our community is to be able to deal with this information .
when i was a kid , there was a future , the future somewhere in 2000 , and people talked about what would happen in the year .
now , if you were to look at the way that these chemicals were organized , there &apos;s a fairly good picture about how they do it .
so we &apos;re going to take a very complicated , put it in sound , and it &apos;s kind of a sound , and produce a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the minds .
and it &apos;s all together to something that is much bigger , and it &apos;s also able to develop faster than we &apos;ve been able to do .
so if we were going to take the fast as the <unk> , the next time we would have been able to put into a taxi and put it in a little 30 seconds , we would be in tokyo .
this has never been done before the history of the <unk> , this kind of <unk> growth , which is a lot of <unk> , which is the whole few years .
in fact , the <unk> of the growth that had a growth of growth , faster than others and build more and more chemicals from the ground and we were able to get out of the ground .
so the question i &apos;m going to ask you is , if you look at this exponential side , you see , you &apos;re going to see , not to go .
now we have a conference here where people are talking about the future , and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is about to store over the billion billion years , which is , right now .
because i think this really , we need to go back and take a step back and look at the point of a level of view .
so that &apos;s just a very simple chemical form of life , but interestingly , if this <unk> is a trick , it &apos;s a trick that &apos;s going to learned a trick about abstraction .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and in a certain chemical shape , which we call dna .
they started to specialists in the community , special structures , special structures , and they learn to learn how to understand the information .
and the process itself is being <unk> and becomes a , i think , is the word of the -- if something its <unk> is the word .
so let &apos;s go back and have 2.5 billion years ago , the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with lots of chemicals .
some of these <unk> were <unk> in a particular combination of chemicals that they allow them to provide other chemicals from the rest of the fish and to grow up .
but these were not the <unk> system that was not in today , because each single was a small , <unk> prescription of chemicals .
because at that time , a individual is a individual -- now in the period of an individual organism , instead of having a evolutionary period of this evolutionary basis .
you &apos;ve seen a little bit of <unk> , you see , he &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> in the <unk> , right in front of the eyes .
so the question i want to ask and i &apos;m also going to do a lot of time is that this is going to be a new world ?
so to make this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really don &apos;t really have to do with technology or the computer .
we &apos;re starting to see the same stages of which <unk> , which is the basic way of our methods , how we use data , right , we &apos;re going to process .
this slide shows a bit of a analysis of a analysis of us about the performance of <unk> , compared to the performance of a single state of a local .
either it &apos;s going to be a classic like this , and it &apos;s going to be like to do something new , or it &apos;s going to happen .
in some way , we don &apos;t understand , very , , these <unk> , the ability to have information information .
if i had a <unk> , i &apos;d have been written to a virus and i &apos;m going to put it on a virus .
this communication allowed for the most of communities that were in some sense of the same room ; they were <unk> .
and that &apos;s a final thing that we have to do with <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> in the area of technology .
we &apos;re on this line , in a transition from the world , a new kind of world .
in fact , the recipe for us , is our genes , from the same same code , and the same thing .
and i have a little <unk> of a <unk> fire , which i &apos;m trying to keep in the airports of <unk> .
at this time we have <unk> communities , communities of many of these <unk> <unk> , which together as a city of individual .
and certainly , if we can have this all the time , and we have a lot of people doing this .
now , i &apos;m a blind , so i think , in the way that this is going to happen .
so in other words , the future is a year since i &apos;m in the world for a year .
and every time it was , they have evolved to spread the chemicals in the way that it &apos;s going to be a different .
so the nervous system has to do the <unk> of this particular brain because of the evolution within a individual .
and what we actually did , we have humanity , humanity , we started to start .
this could be , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a trash with a <unk> <unk> .
is it really , that means , we &apos;re right here in the right right here .
i want to talk to you about what this is , this transition in which we are currently .
we &apos;re so far that we can actually write just to the <unk> , the ourselves in this code .
and they developed special structures that nothing else made out of the information in the process .
the first steps of history , which i told you about , is a billion years per year .
i &apos;m not going to tell you the details of the slide , but it &apos;s actually about the form of the form .
it &apos;s not possible that everything forever and forever are now as well as now .
because the transition seems to be very , very very , if you &apos;re in the middle of this .
the reason i think that is that we &apos;re going to realize that there &apos;s something else .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve already knew this , but bacteria can actually share your dna .
what happened after that , the individual organisms had a way to communicate with each other .
then the <unk> steps , like language and so on , as , as a million years , it &apos;s a million years .
the next steps , like the nervous system , and the brain , a hundred hundred million years .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this deep curve .
so this <unk> is to survive , and they &apos;re moving into <unk> .
and the cells of these cells -- that they were made for a more billion years .
so for example , the most powerful , the most famous version of this brain is the human language .
and these apps , let &apos;s use our hands to improve our communities .
i &apos;m going to start to you a little bit of a little bit of the final slide .
a little bit more little , because i &apos;m going to draw it on the paper .
but if something like this , this is what happens to the conditions .
i think the real point of meaning is that you put it in some more .
i have a very complicated , <unk> and <unk> idea of my head .
and these next steps , like electronics , just like a few decades .
and we don &apos;t need to improve the government until we do better .
this is a slide that i &apos;ve chosen from my chosen .
in other words , everybody step here is a turning place in the <unk> .
and i want to look at this on the earth &apos;s surface of life .
that &apos;s why the reason is why , for example , the current industry .
we have a lot of cells that are not going to be on .
your cells are useless without heart , muscle , cells and so on .
so this allows us to work with a unified organism .
well , why are we flying in the technology in the technology ?
and that every life uses the same same letters and the same code .
so the neurons are the <unk> that have made these <unk> .
the invention of the language for example , was a small step in this direction .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about .
what is this new state that we think is going to come up with .
and the next interesting thing about this is about another billion years ago .
it &apos;s a really extraordinary invention of this , you know , it &apos;s a lot of things .
the more change it changes faster changes .
we see the process of themselves itself .
so , if you could turn the lights off .
in fact , we &apos;re also a <unk> community .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
so today , evolution can be at the time of the <unk> .
we are more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
the transition happens . we can all feel it .
these little <unk> were in the sense of the <unk> .
... could you show the slide for the slide .
all of those things were starting to do .
the dna of dna was a more interesting step .
so the next step is happening in this communities .
so we have the <unk> <unk> again .
so every <unk> was a little bit different .
the <unk> began to be information again .
it could be a <unk> in a <unk> .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
but that &apos;s not so fast .
we don &apos;t go to that .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
and these are the neural structures .
this gave you a potential advantage .
something very strange is happening here .
and this is what it looks like .
it &apos;s about it .
there are two options .
thank you .
what i do do , and what the designers do about thinking is , we think we &apos;re on a certain sense , a machine , and the machine makes this machine and the machine makes something that our capacity to do , better than we could make it happen .
i &apos;m living from building computers , and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism that i use using computers , not using the late idea of the recently in the process .
in the next book , we &apos;re using a interaction with the video of the paper and using <unk> , a animation of shows a lot of shows that one &apos;s sitting on a plant in front of the house .
i know i &apos;m sure that i &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to do the job because you &apos;re from a bunch of <unk> programs that have the job .
we bring our kids and we closer to the natural world , and to the magic , and the love of our childhood through the very simple medium of a story .
my current activity is in , objects with such a great complexity that it &apos;s impossible to make this sense of to design this in traditional sense .
of course , the chance of randomly chosen by random african , very small that they just heard of a chance , so you don &apos;t really have the instructions to do this .
there &apos;s this airplane from <unk> <unk> , which is , you know , making these work up to make their own flight . &quot;
now please please please send these random chosen , all the programs , and then finally , the ones that i &apos;m on the next few of my patients . &quot;
so i have a new generation of programs that were inspired by various forms of programs that have been closer to the ones that are closer to the census of others .
i was once in a bubble with a police <unk> , <unk> , he <unk> a map of a card and says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
we use these programs to make a lot more faster , so that we can actually able to do these processes more faster than that we can actually do these processes .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use them to use them to make magic instead .
and then , a letter for me to go down -- and the outside know , i know , i know , gps , where i &apos;m going to do -- that &apos;s really true .
the subject of the last 10 years is that a big problem of the last 10 years is that kids are sitting in their cooking , in their computers , no no .
we all move us to a world where the technology &apos;s development come closer to the magic and technology can be able to address .
take two programs and they produce kids through their own <unk> , and the children of the children &apos;s properties of the two programs .
in a interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search , you have to get out and with the camera of the light images of the whole natural natural objects .
and so i can let a evolution over millions of years in the computer within a decade , or in a lot of time , in times a few hours .
back then , when the great indian <unk> <unk> had had a bow , and he would put a bow , put into the ground and water .
i was afraid that i could lose the ability to have an ability to enjoy the emotional and without a camera , without my friends .
i spend the most of my time with the social moments in the <unk> and places that there are very much a lot of food .
so to call an example , in the extreme extreme , we can create a program that made up from random .
i mean , not a lot of the childhood and construction , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
and so here &apos;s what this book is all about , every world &apos;s a little <unk> , which i &apos;m here to be able to put on the magic device in the device .
this is <unk> . you have to reach out of a couple of a photo and make a picture of a flower and tag .
here at ted , to see and hear , how conversations that &apos;s , i &apos;ve given me a lot of force .
a way that is particularly interesting , which is , and i &apos;ve been using it in recently , is evolution .
now i &apos;m going to say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the world that i have to be on the next .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we &apos;re not able to make it quite what we &apos;re doing here .
when i saw the outside , i saw it as a device for storytelling , the readers around the world .
a kid in london show a picture of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , today i &apos;ve seen a look at this . &quot;
let &apos;s say , i want to get numbers , which would be a simple example of what i &apos;ve used to do .
the fact that these are are so much more efficient than any program that i could ever have from hand .
another idea that i &apos;m a kid as a kid is that a whole galaxy can be built in a single <unk> .
we &apos;ve heard of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people know outside the indian colleagues , the <unk> of the indian ?
so we start to rely on the computer for a process which is a lot of the classical games .
we &apos;re at a point where we &apos;re going to be a <unk> , to have a <unk> <unk> .
now , the lunch lunch before and i think i &apos;m listening to this before i &apos;m still going to get to <unk> .
it allows us to do things with a much greater complexity than it &apos;s possible to allow the normal way to produce .
we talked about that , there &apos;s nothing changed that has nothing since the time of ancient indian <unk> . &quot;
she became a <unk> access to a world of community and <unk> and <unk> and into my vision .
but now , with the mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
this is a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you &apos;ve actually taken .
and i think we &apos;re all part of the creation of whatever &apos;s going to happen next .
i was like , as a thought , we were going to send our camera and back to the dreams .
it &apos;s also important for me to make something that is that , but it &apos;s also very <unk> .
it &apos;s getting faster , and i think it &apos;s the reason that it seems to be so looks .
i think it &apos;s very <unk> by us to say that we are the evolution of evolution .
when we went back to the morning , we stopped a car and <unk> across the sky .
and so -- here says , &quot; this box -- &quot; i write my name .
and it &apos;s part of the way we &apos;re doing , which we don &apos;t even understand .
and then i look at these programs , i can &apos;t say how to work .
the poor <unk> were thousands of years in <unk> , in a old book , in a old book .
so you can actually actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can ask .
there &apos;s a variety of ways that we can connect to the world and technology and technology .
you have to make the sound of the <unk> , you can read and read the rest of the book .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> hundred million random million of us are <unk> by the trees .
but one of those things might be like a number of numbers in the right order to get .
we know that a <unk> isn &apos;t even a when it &apos;s too complicated .
when i was a little girl , i gave my grandfather to <unk> his little <unk> .
we came to conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
a kid in india says , &quot; i have seen a monkeys . &quot;
i spend the most majority of my time in <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> .
in the short time here , i was given to me , he &apos;s got an idea : ted has an identity .
so , we put a <unk> in the machine , which is what the inside the machine .
because their lives were made of whether they did the job right .
i was under the front of the night in the desert with <unk> <unk> .
it gives pictures and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
this map is basically and and and it &apos;s also to the coffee in the book of the book .
one story that goes up with new affairs , like the <unk> .
as a child , i had learned about <unk> , stones , <unk> and <unk> .
i don &apos;t know what any individual transistor in the <unk> .
now , <unk> all the <unk> who have the numbers best .
and it &apos;s a way of the <unk> , to address . &quot;
because all these new technologies are now from themselves from themselves .
my story starts to be right here in tank , about two years ago .
i thought that technology should be possible to kill and not kill .
this piece of 50 technology was the <unk> thing for me .
and we bring it back , in a particular story , children &apos;s history .
in another chapter , you have to <unk> a piece of <unk> and <unk> .
but i really believe that we &apos;re going to get something else .
i just go to <unk> , a interactive <unk> app .
says , &quot; you put your fingers on any light . &quot;
so you have to know the star , and the <unk> are <unk> .
the <unk> always had maps , but these maps were static .
so in other words , i first got to know what i want .
so , think of the most common numbers of the most possible numbers .
finally , i &apos;ve got to programs that can get numbers at the numbers .
and yet , we don &apos;t really understand the possibilities of that yet .
the child &apos;s really excited to me .
and what we do is , again , with another generation .
and i &apos;m going to make a character in the book .
fireflies in a glass of glass , i found myself .
and the way that the way through the book .
it also shows the other places of the book .
there &apos;s a place of the screen with the screen .
tell , &quot; please do this process . &quot;
now we do this with <unk> and machines .
they were being inspired by being inspired by us .
it can know how we keep it .
this is really an honor honor for me .
so that &apos;s just the rest of the rest .
i tried to understand them .
i started to illustrate books .
it can know where we are .
all of these generations just need a few milliseconds .
it &apos;s pieces of weird programs .
so , <unk> technology , that &apos;s us .
we are in the middle of this room .
now we do this with airplanes .
i got a fear of technology .
the needs always always always always always .
i talked a lot about magic .
it &apos;s like not to do the kids .
we use the energy of the sun .
it &apos;s billions of people .
maybe some elders will be a few .
but they do do the job .
so there &apos;s a <unk> .
i really really sad .
but what do we do with it ?
and this is a map of a map .
this is the <unk> .
i go in here .
get them back .
we raise <unk> .
thank you .
these older people come to me and say , &quot; mr. , <unk> , you talk , they &apos;re talking to the people they stop saying they should stop saying that they say to say , &quot; mr. , &quot; in the history of our nation , for us , after 9
that was 15 or 20 minutes , and then she came up and came up and came over and she took me at hand and said , &quot; come on , you know , <unk> . you and i said , we need to talk . &quot;
in urban communities , in the country -- from los angeles , from asia , to washington , are 50 to 60 percent of all the black men men in prison , in jail , in jail , or <unk> or <unk> .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day , one day my brother and got this <unk> beer , and i was my sister and i went to the forest .
we think that because you &apos;ve taught us that the real question is : have a human being asked to die for one of him ?
and then she said , &quot; as next , you know , you &apos;re going to do the right thing . &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing .
she took me out with me and said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you must have promise you . &quot;
i grew up on the farm in the old , rural south south , and i have a brother who &apos;s older and a year old sister .
one two hours later , when i had her her her , she came to me and said , &quot; <unk> , you know , you &apos;re still feeling my own ? &quot;
i remember , i have to eight or nine or nine , i was able to finish a morning and living room . all my cousins were around .
and then he looked at the face and said , &quot; oh , you &apos;re not feeling about your moral care because of the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
we have been on nine people who have been , and one that we &apos;ve got for innocent , who &apos;s got <unk> and out of the u.s.
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of an accident , but the words of an incredibly important thing is , particularly meaningful .
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
i was in a family , a family &apos;s a traditional <unk> , who was being dominated by a <unk> , and this <unk> was my grandmother .
and if i said no , i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to turn it back . if i said , &quot; i said , &quot; yes , let me go .
then he took a drink and and i took my sister , and she took me , and then she took me one .
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you &apos;ve got to work with promise you . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , now we &apos;re doing this , you know , you &apos;re doing anything else , you &apos;re doing anything else .
if we can create the right kind of identity , we can tell people about things they don &apos;t believe .
we have a <unk> that you have in this country that you &apos;re growing up with a lot of better than you and innocent and you have to innocent .
we &apos;re <unk> the u.s. of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , as high as the <unk> of the <unk> .
the other one is not that , somebody for a crime crime , but we have it to kill , is it ?
and then she said , &quot; the last thing you &apos;ve got to promise me is that you never get to drink . &quot;
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s <unk> . i say it &apos;s a <unk> .
one of three black black men between 18 and 30 , in prison , in <unk> , on <unk> , or <unk> .
our system isn &apos;t just going to have a difference by asking the way that have to do with <unk> , it &apos;s also by poverty .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . it &apos;s all right . i don &apos;t want to go . i don &apos;t want beer . &quot;
and sometimes when something goes on , it gets a meaning and force that wouldn &apos;t have otherwise .
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
the united states of america are the only country in the world , the <unk> children in jail .
we would never fly someone with a plane , when nine planes , who , a natural one .
i &apos;m my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , i &apos;m going to do this . &quot;
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , which is the time of the <unk> , to the beginning of the second healthcare system .
sometimes i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get her attention .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m going to have a drop of alcohol at all .
a politics of fear and anger has us convinced that these problems are not our problems .
she &apos;d hold me so that i could barely breathe . they went to me .
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
she said , &quot; first , i &apos;m told you , you &apos;re always going to love your mom . &quot;
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m my students in my students , and i &apos;m talking about slavery .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor , you can do more .
when i met her as a little boy , she came up and <unk> me .
she was something that was done , and she wanted to be close to her .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do it . it &apos;s just . &quot;
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot; well , what do you do ?
and she believed that these are the issues that we would have to take care of .
in socially weak and black , of the population , the other of the population and communities , because of this changes .
here in the islands , there are <unk> percent of the male population of the population lost their <unk> .
but you can also think differently , depending on how we see our identity .
i talk about race and the question we have to kill is right .
it was born and the experience of the human population &apos;s experience very strong .
then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise me three things , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
i thought , and i said , &quot; yes , dude . i promise it . &quot;
i had what , your sister had what , and i was a beer . &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma told all the ted care you you &apos;re going to be special . &quot;
my home , they &apos;re holding the <unk> , when they &apos;re <unk> .
i &apos;m saying that because i think identity is very important .
i saw them and she was and followed , but she looked very seriously .
she said , &quot; yes ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
of course , my grandmother would all say all of their grandchildren , you &apos;re something special .
in this country , there are <unk> <unk> without <unk> <unk> .
but for the same cancer , it was a time of terror .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have the way in my work as a kid .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had so much .
their parents were born in the <unk> of a slave .
the only problem was she had 10 kids .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the <unk> and i was focused on .
seven million people are on <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
but somehow we can do it , we &apos;re going to <unk> this problem .
it was the fear of terror that their life was shaped .
you can tell things that have influence around the world .
and so , i want to talk about power power of identity .
she was also a place of many of our family .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also too far .
i remember it was when it was yesterday .
i tried to say something about our <unk> .
the united states is the highest world &apos;s highest world .
first , i thought that was a game .
we &apos;ve just been around there as well as it .
there were people in the &apos; 80s and in prison and in prison .
i think , is fundamentally changing our world &apos;s world .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of <unk> .
she had the last word in every single day .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
i said , &quot; i , grandmother , grandmother . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandmother . &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
my grandfather was in the prison in prison .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
wealth , not <unk> , the result .
yet , we seem to be happy with it .
the question of death is a interesting question .
the death penalty in america is made by error .
it &apos;s an amazing <unk> . one of nine innocent innocent .
i learned that from my grandmother .
there are some more sophisticated developments .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of things .
we don &apos;t really know about it .
we &apos;ve seen some amazing actors .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
i should probably not to do that .
this is maybe a public protein .
my uncle died in <unk> diseases .
many of my most are very young .
that &apos;s a very serious question .
i &apos;m talking about these questions .
my cousins were all around .
i &apos;m never going to forget it .
i will never forget that .
my brother kept me .
i was destroyed the floor .
i &apos;m going to show you something .
today , it &apos;s dynamic .
we have lost the contact .
the only country in the world .
i &apos;m people in <unk> .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
the silence is <unk> .
i find this fascinating .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
i &apos;m <unk> kids .
or bombs .
and yet , in this country , the united states , the united states , we are going to be the risk of death to death , even if the victims is when the black is black , when the victims is black , the <unk> is black , and the victim is black and the victim -- in the same time , the body is the body of the body .
her wife came back to <unk> , where she had two of her elders friends , <unk> <unk> , who had <unk> the <unk> -- a tremendous <unk> -- and virginia <unk> , a white <unk> , a white brother , her husband , <unk> , dr. king .
and finally , i think , although it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , we don &apos;t have to be in our technology at the end of our technology , not to the things that we &apos;re not developing , not to our minds and mind .
&quot; when we were to europe , we wanted to kinds of things , but what we needed to do most needed , hope , a spiritual orientation , to be the most , sometimes in the face of being places , and being connected .
one day i was there and listening to this women , and after a few hours , woman decided to me and told us , &quot; well , <unk> , tell me what the leader is for for the good is .
it &apos;s this <unk> , which i think is not just to be open for all the bright and things , but also for the dark and <unk> things , but also for the dark and <unk> .
there &apos;s no <unk> to be technology and design that allows us to be completely human , as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , and we have the same , and the injustice .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not going to be willing to get the truth and the reconciliation .
eventually , a society is not about how they &apos;re their rich and powerful and severe , but they &apos;re treated with the poor , the first thing , the world , the <unk> .
and i started to this . the sky said , &quot; the writer , my arms , <unk> black , <unk> black , like a <unk> , white <unk> . &quot;
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists came up after my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply like you &apos;re talking about . &quot;
it was very still . it said a woman , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible to make us ever again for the wing of people .
as it would be , in a world , the german state of people were <unk> , especially if there were a lot of jews , especially if there was a lot of jews .
then , a woman <unk> to me , and he was a finger on my face and said , &quot; and therefore , you have to be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and i stayed on a night , and i was thinking , my god , if you could have a judge , , a judge could have to put us into something else , and then he must have <unk> .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and with safety in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
for me , the time i think about it , and talking about the poor , the ones that are going to be never going to be at ted .
so , she called a woman called me and said , &quot; <unk> , woman is coming in the city . we want to talk about .
i go to the <unk> and i go to a <unk> , the 13 or 14 years old , and the should be the moment of court .
it &apos;s something that goes into me , identity , the ability to create any <unk> , something to a community , to a sense of hope .
because we &apos;re talking about that we need more hope , more commitment , more commitment to be able to do in a complex world .
after all , this older black guy came out with a very <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and sat down in the way that i was on the street .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
i want to call it . this kind of identity is much more of us than if we don &apos;t make it about .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think of it , i started working on a piece of a .
the next morning i woke up and i didn &apos;t know if i was this crazy , or it was actually written this crazy .
in the <unk> of the world , the most people who were mad , we were talking about color , about poverty , about inequality .
i was holding my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . &quot;
there was a crazy line on this country that in this country , there &apos;s nothing more <unk> that there &apos;s only one .
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> don &apos;t have to overcome the <unk> , and the real thing is to be true .
if we don &apos;t care about it , with these difficult subjects , the positive things are really concerned .
this mental mental orientation is the core of what i think is that the <unk> need to be involved in .
but then , i decided to get my god , i have to go into the dish and this crazy case .
when i was the staircase to the dish , there was a elderly , male man , the telephone in the dish .
and because that &apos;s like , there &apos;s a fundamental human being , the law has to respect .
because in this context , we &apos;re starting to start the true amazing things that we can make .
in my respect , i explained that the <unk> and the police was <unk> and the police and the police .
and he saw me , he came up to me and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
they say , &quot; no , tell people that we grew up with . &quot;
and yet , in our country , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were this <unk> , but not in this country .
and after the terrorism , of course , the the <unk> and decades of the <unk> were the <unk> and the cancer .
if somebody does something that doesn &apos;t heard him , it &apos;s not just a fit .
and i had to go through my unfortunately , but i was sent to the court .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what to do in the world , and we have a lot of things .
but in a way , it &apos;s a way that we &apos;re living in our own life .
we do that . so we &apos;re also thinking that we appreciate it as much as we think .
she said , &quot; and what are you doing when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
we need to think of ways to have these challenges : these problems , that is .
that we all have more than the worst worst thing we ever ever done .
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
but eventually , the chinese <unk> of sorry , abuse , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
they &apos;re coming from ideas that are driven by the beliefs in our hearts .
i think there &apos;s many places in many places that &apos;s the opposite of poverty .
and sometimes these ideas are ahead of thinking about the very important way .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , have you put this crazy <unk> ? &quot;
we all need to believe in the very least things we can &apos;t see .
as a young lawyer , i &apos;m the great privilege of the <unk> <unk> .
she said , &quot; this will be very , very tired . &quot;
how does a judge someone get into something that is not that ?
i ended up with my car , and i went to the dish .
and he was seeing through the window and the whole thing was hearing by the whole thing .
it would be <unk> by us , consciously , and human beings .
innovation , creativity , and development , not only come from our minds .
i &apos;m <unk> these kids who were too hard to do .
the judge is him as adults , but i see a child .
and of course , they never give them more in germany .
<unk> <unk> , who said great <unk> politicians .
and so i think that the ted will be <unk> .
because ultimately , our humanity , our humanity is all our humanity .
i think that &apos;s true for everybody on the planet .
if someone is lying , it &apos;s not just a liars .
a couple of months ago , and i had just forgotten everything .
and i thought that it &apos;s hard to do so much .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
more people always started in , because they were angry .
from my my <unk> , i saw the fish down to the back .
i &apos;ve been talking about a couple of talks about the penalty .
he said , &quot; there &apos;s no death in germany .
and i said , &quot; yes , really , really . &quot;
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to get out of injustice .
we want to <unk> <unk> <unk> without <unk> <unk> for children .
even who kill somebody is not just a kid .
i &apos;m going to keep the balance .
i had a <unk> , poor black young young boy .
i went into the car and really really fell .
so these women were met and they were just .
and i went over and i just heard it .
they want to help people who have innocent people who have been innocent .
and i &apos;ve learned very simple things .
and i wonder , how could that happen ?
and i must say , there was a lot of them .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental mental <unk> .
i &apos;m really important to do both of them .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
it was so inspiring , so it was so <unk> .
we want to fight the and <unk> in the <unk> .
i learned a couple of very simple things .
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
<unk> would come in and <unk> and go .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
we always create new tensions and conflicts .
i think our identity is <unk> .
we want to go to the united states .
we want the number of damage to lower .
i &apos;m going to tired of how we all all .
he came to me and <unk> me .
i wrote these crazy things .
do you want to hear <unk> and listen ? &quot;
what do you try to reach ? &quot;
i started talking about my usual talk .
you should also be what you &apos;re doing .
then he did get me into the ear .
well , i &apos;m going to the <unk> .
we love technology and creativity .
it &apos;s going to touch it .
we want to <unk> <unk> . &quot;
sometimes i &apos;m too too .
so i went to the dish .
and when the judge saw me .
he went on and down .
we &apos;re constantly <unk> .
i thought about it .
i don &apos;t think that .
it would be a lot .
it would be <unk> .
we love innovation .
we love entertainment .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; which is to be my friends at risk &quot; <unk> and networks , robots and networks , 3d , that enable the other production to our planet , synthetic biology , the most powerful , and digital medicine , and <unk> , and artificial intelligence .
the older black man stood up . he saw the <unk> , he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m a am a to say , &quot; i &apos;m gone to say , &quot; don &apos;t get the goal from the eyes . don &apos;t get to go
if you live in california , you have a <unk> , where it &apos;s about this , actually , a effort to create a effort , something of the most of the <unk> that &apos;s going to be in the way that the way that you &apos;re in the way .
perhaps the vast progress of progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century , by an set of forces , so that it &apos;s possible that it will be possible to create a world of the .
last month , this one has published a study that shows that until the end of the decade of the west in the west , from six cents per unit , compared to 15 cents per average national average .
my good friend , he was telling us that every tool that is going to present us to the information , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and the <unk> of all the 12 to 24 months .
now we have &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , &quot; people for always put together over <unk> , for a <unk> , for the profound good , instead of having them to the things that are going to give the victims .
so these are just a few of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it also could be the last six days .
now , with all our digital devices that we &apos;re seven of us every week , 24 hours a day all of the negative news , it &apos;s not a miracle that we &apos;re going to be .
remember that a great deal of americans , the below the poverty , access to electricity , water , and <unk> , tv , , and cars , and cars .
i think i think more and making more , i mean , not a life of life for every on this planet ; it &apos;s about making a life full of opportunity .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral biological of the universe is far beyond the universe , but that &apos;s the justice of the world .
this year , you &apos;ve got to take the cost for the first time to make the cost of fuel in india , <unk> rupees in comparison to 17 rupees .
and especially , i want to share with you that one of the things that you see is not just the goal of the eyes . don &apos;t get them .
and every year we ask the students , we can create the companies and services that can be able to live within the living of people .
we bring our students to do all these technologies with the profound focus on how they can be used to solve the big challenges of humanity .
and because of our more important , our survival is the first source of all the information is part of our <unk> , the skin .
now , i &apos;m not saying we have a big problem -- climate crisis , climate , water and <unk> -- that we &apos;ve already done .
in the last 100 years , the average lifespan has more than doubled , that the most likely to have the population &apos;s population has nearly the world &apos;s population .
and on that curve , on the back of moore &apos;s on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available .
do you remember , as a gentleman , the <unk> , when it was in the sun , was it back to the earth ?
here , in california , you will be a billion dollars for the next five years , the death of a billion dollars .
the fact is that the media is prefer to show us a negative subjects , because our minds are simply doing these issues .
the first is , like , as you look -- in good , war , war or peace , depression , and <unk> .
they have seen a wish to this community , and they heard a obvious wish and they &apos;re to help them .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims , not less .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at problems , but they &apos;re starting to overcome , but they eventually have to overcome .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs a million times a million times less than a <unk> from the &apos; 70s .
that we have our compassion of technology and design , from entertainment and creativity , with humanity , compassion and justice .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can &apos;t change the development .
four years ago , ray ray ray , and i met ted at ted , which is called the university .
but then the technology was developed and made it <unk> , so that we use it to be using it with our <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;re living on a planet of the more than we &apos;re using per year than we &apos;re using per year .
and according to charles <unk> , the <unk> of the last 130 years is 25 percent at 80 percent .
the richest state of the last century , the earth &apos;s <unk> , would never have any of the earth &apos;s minds .
think about that , a group of students today that can affect the lives of billions of people today .
during the pause , a <unk> in her , that was the last <unk> in the <unk> .
that we &apos;re not fully developed as humans , as we &apos;re not so human rights and <unk> .
it was so <unk> and <unk> the whole information of the search for <unk> of danger in our environment .
every second , our senses , our senses can actually have a lot more information than our mammals .
so , when we see the news , we prefer to look at the negative news .
and that &apos;s that the <unk> , <unk> , and then you can have a bit of a costs .
steve , we showed us that we &apos;re currently in a very peaceful time in the world of life .
i was going to look at the papers and i was looking for the best of the things i could find .
imagine that this artificial intelligence of any owner of a <unk> .
now , the time , the most valuable metal on the planet , valuable than gold and <unk> .
the most of the most <unk> in this country was actually not really in the class of the <unk> .
and the old claim , &quot; when it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s very true .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that everybody thinks it &apos;s worse .
how many of you have the defeat of <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> . &quot;
although mr. <unk> percent of the <unk> , it &apos;s not as a little metal .
and if we have a <unk> , we &apos;ll have water in the abundance .
this <unk> is going to be a lot of money to invest in more and more security .
this is why the dome of the <unk> was made of music .
we live on a planet that is covered to 70 percent with water .
when we think of it , in believed , the first three of the police .
and , despite , despite the three of the radio <unk> on the left , it &apos;s open .
now we can actually have on dozens of companies that have done this .
this is the history of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he said , &quot; do you do in the <unk> ? &quot;
during the last three decades , the <unk> has been total <unk> in america .
and this fact is often a lot of the relationship with the percentage of the land .
well , in fact , the number of <unk> is not very much .
the basis of a lot of these are technologies and these growing <unk> .
this is the result of using the computers that build up the computer .
because , the reason is , and technology is a resources of the force .
that our survival of our survival is connected to each other .
and yet , 46 percent of all <unk> <unk> is not a <unk> .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , you really have a <unk> to the census .
he &apos;s death to get a <unk> of his <unk> .
four : <unk> <unk> . five 5 : dangerous <unk> .
six : social life . child seven : 65 of americans .
it &apos;s not about the , the problem is .
the cost of solar consumption in the last year for 50 percent .
we &apos;ve got <unk> <unk> from the thousand of the birds .
and i think our current life will not help .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
i love this : &quot; <unk> <unk> human &apos;s human . &quot;
it &apos;s about understanding the ground of language .
it &apos;s about creating of modern modern abundance .
and then we took this analogy to the future .
16 <unk> <unk> all the the <unk> every single minutes .
he took a famous photograph . how did it do ?
ten minutes later , the judge was a pause .
<unk> <unk> : well , there &apos;s all sorts of possibilities .
there &apos;s a chance to do something .
what would you tell to say that who believe that ?
so the dramatic levels come from the end .
treasure . <unk> . egypt . egypt . syria .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for this .
so the fact is our <unk> , our <unk> .
he invited the king of <unk> for dinner .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> <unk> , <unk> himself .
this <unk> ran on the older black black .
now , 250 percent of all <unk> don &apos;t come in .
eight : <unk> . child &apos;s ...
different : <unk> . thank you .
this is moore &apos;s law last hundred years .
they &apos;re <unk> for none of our big problems .
30 years ago , this is what happened to us .
i think there are opportunities .
it was the <unk> <unk> against drugs .
but potentially , that &apos;s not the case .
child mortality has a tenth of reduce .
we &apos;re living in a truly extraordinary time .
and we increase our expectations constantly .
now look at this curve .
and notice two things on this curve .
&quot; risks &quot; isn &apos;t a simple game .
the king of <unk> was got to <unk> .
it &apos;s being connected by oxygen and <unk> .
in fact , we have defined poverty .
so the growth itself is accelerating .
&quot; a <unk> blue . &quot;
because we live on a <unk> .
what can we do ?
they &apos;re a inspiring personality .
crisis . death . disaster .
maybe the reality is .
and many people forget this .
he &apos;s the guy left .
we &apos;re thinking about <unk> .
and there &apos;s good news .
that was a real thing .
here &apos;s an example .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
oh my god .
and from a conversation today , the morning with dean <unk> , who was a <unk> , i would share with you -- he gave me the permission -- his name -- which is called the &quot; <unk> , &quot; and many of you may have heard about it . it &apos;s the size of a <unk> in the <unk> .
and when these people came and looked at who the best best of the world was not a <unk> , no <unk> , it was a man of england , who was a woman who was a student who was working at a moment and at night at night , and the best the best of the world was the best of the world .
and it &apos;s better to do things that you spend , and i spent a thousand thousand dollars -- gps , and and a picture , a little bit of books and music , and technology , to medical medical -- now literally <unk> and cheaper in your cell phone .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier by the use of the <unk> , and they will get better through the <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be able to have the opportunity to use 3d and &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and so much more productive than ever .
one of the things that i learned by the x prize is that small teams that have been motivated and focus with passion are able to do extraordinary things , things that have great companies and governments only have in the past .
we &apos;re all the teams around the world , all these technologies in each other in a cell , that you can speak with the device , because it &apos;s using a visual <unk> , you can test your <unk> or your <unk> .
and i left the medical system , and i knew everything i knew everything and everything else , or so much as possible , as possible as possible to be a immune , that i was going to make a immune against that i was doing .
i didn &apos;t take the tv , and i did what i should have been doing with my <unk> , to be able to do it with him , so that he had a chance to make a chance to make a own image .
this is the ball to the ball , he gets up , he &apos;s not caught , and who tried to throw the ball to the ball , and he didn &apos;t get it in time and the market was in the security .
this is a state of the heart where the heart of the blood continues , and then a lot of the blood in the lung , and then a little bit of the inside the lung , and the way that comes out of the way that came up with .
ladies and gentlemen , what i believe is that i think of the future , we have today more power than individuals have to be the most important of our planet .
let &apos;s go back to the world of medicine that i &apos;m interested in a lot of a little bit , or maybe a little bit less , i &apos;ve talked to you about it .
maybe i wanted to be successful and so to take responsibility , i would be so , and i would be able to worry about my patients for my patients .
how about that , the african , wherever you are , to give a voice to make it be , to make and create change , for the first time ?
imagine they live in a particular area , and they have a loved people with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and her <unk> <unk> to a <unk> whose income is <unk> at <unk> .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent of the top , two percent are <unk> , and we &apos;re fighting for the percent of the planet on the planet , but there &apos;s hope .
it can make a thousand of a water of water per day from different sources of different sources -- whether a <unk> , water , <unk> -- and all that &apos;s less than two cents per phone .
imagine that this device . in a country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and the 25 percent of the staff of the healthcare system .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work online with online to the new challenges , and to do what it is to do .
and when i was her chest with the <unk> , i could tell you a <unk> sound on both sides , and that told me that she was suffering under <unk> .
and maybe i &apos;m a long enough in business , that i can allow me to be able to make a piece of my own wrong <unk> .
in my school , i learned the origins and new field of every <unk> , anyone from the <unk> , which is the <unk> , and the <unk> of the person &apos;s <unk> , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
and when everything is fine , i &apos;m very confident , and then i &apos;m a lot of this technology in the <unk> of this planet in the whole planet .
if this device is not known or a <unk> , a <unk> , it &apos;s not known , it &apos;s called the price of the and the military &apos;s a pandemic .
remember , a <unk> <unk> with a cell phone in the middle of kenya , a better <unk> than president said 25 years ago .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino amino sizes to explore how the protein will become .
what we do is that we &apos;re every of them , including me , in the world , to be able to be the same perfect .
and if you &apos;re looking at google , you have to look at more access and you have more access to knowledge and information than president clinton .
last month , i had the pleasure with the <unk> called the $ 10 10 million <unk> , x prize , x x .
what do you think you &apos;re like to do the <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse or a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> ?
<unk> -- like ted williams <unk> , the last <unk> <unk> <unk> , who was met during a <unk> season for a <unk> season .
the truth is that nobody in all the medicine knows what a good surgeon or doctor should be .
they live in a world that information and communication and communication on how no one could have realized .
i &apos;m going to be a certain case of that , i &apos;m hoping most of you have heard of it .
suppose you have a <unk> and you &apos;re going to be a <unk> , which is 400 400 times in terms of <unk> .
you know , i mean , we &apos;re going to get 70 percent of the treatment in the developing world to the end of africa .
and by the way , the largest <unk> of the population is a better education and diet in the world .
&quot; <unk> &quot; seems soon and turns out to be about statistics and to use these to use a great bits of team .
i &apos;m in a <unk> here in toronto here as a woman &apos;s a woman &apos;s team in the room .
three billion new minds of minds that we &apos;ve never heard before , will come to the global communication .
never make a mistake , no one &apos;s going to be the details of the details of how to be that .
and i learned in my little <unk> <unk> at the <unk> of the <unk> , i was a <unk> hospital , <unk> from here .
i gave her medicine that we call <unk> , water , so she <unk> the liquid .
so the fate of coca-cola has just been <unk> , a large <unk> of a hundred units in developing countries .
but before i do that , i &apos;m going to come to the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little bit .
in high school , a lost once said that brian would learn for a <unk> .
and to win , the device has to be better better than a team of <unk> doctors .
so what can we do about three billion , healthy , vast members of the world &apos;s going to bring us ?
and it showed that today , the human typically is better the protein of the protein .
and it was my mission to study the <unk> of advice to study the <unk> .
and over a half of a year to be more and a half , i started to feel better .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people who have played online online .
i gave her her <unk> . i gave her to her to the safety of the heart .
and he knew she was able to put information into the way to her <unk> .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
but now the biggest force that we &apos;re going to lead to a world of a attraction .
and instead of being a happy , i see one of the biggest economic <unk> of history .
these people represent multiple trillion to the global economy .
i think we have to have a bit of a <unk> piece of food to do it .
and i think that it starts with a medical community , and i am .
and the best part of what we might expect to do in the health .
it &apos;s a lot better . it &apos;s a lot of it .
and it was for a time , until i met wife .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
in 2010 , we had just two billion people around each other .
how about a sentence , a new new , never before .
how about <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
i want to finish with a story that really excites me .
we are near the <unk> near us , and we &apos;re moving on the world .
that means that the player are actually three of 10 , you know , the player .
this is at this time , i was able to do the <unk> layer in the <unk> .
by 2020 , we increase <unk> from two to five billion <unk> .
so , as the same behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
we talk about a 300 when a pink is not a big .
do you know how to call a <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> ?
this is somebody who &apos;s in the near four .
and that &apos;s the message i &apos;m in the medical system .
i knew even the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
and i was good , i was <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
i sent them home without my <unk> with my <unk> .
there &apos;s a program that may have already already .
it was developed in the university of washington in seattle .
and i &apos;ve got more and more knowledge .
and when i was her , she made a sound .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
this is <unk> innovation that &apos;s available .
what will they consume ? what are they going to mean ?
i studied a printer , and she was in <unk> .
i made them and i made them to treat the treatment .
and we also have seen this in mobile .
i call them &quot; the last billion . &quot;
it &apos;s a game called solved .
and this is very important in the <unk> .
and this game was played by popular and played .
we have access to tools with technology .
well , really , well , maybe a <unk> .
and that was not a hard to <unk> .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the <unk> doctor .
what do these three billion people get ?
so , this was a problem for a quality .
you know how to call a <unk> ?
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
and i want to get to my <unk> .
maybe i did not have a good reason .
the white lines are on the population .
we just have the <unk> .
we have the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of the capital .
we expect a couple of extraordinary years .
we all love , right ?
sport is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
but , you know what ?
i was a <unk> student student .
and she &apos;s a <unk> .
and it was also .
i felt really good .
actually , i made two mistakes .
my second mistake was worse .
what do these people need ?
hey , why not ?
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
1,000 , very good .
i learned everything .
thank you .
three : 10 .
so the system is creating the way that people make easier to create mistakes that are making people make mistakes , and they can actually be able to do the health , and actually be able to do things that are accessible and even for that , and that &apos;s why , for humans like me , the mistakes and the people who are doing and for the <unk> of these <unk> should be .
in my show , i &apos;m a white mistake , black , &quot; i &apos;ve got to say the habit of my &quot; i would say to everybody &apos;s habit to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; which is my worst mistake , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; and then i &apos;ll show you , &quot; and i &apos;m going to show you the microphone . &quot;
if i was in a room full of her crowd and to tell you what i was going to do with her , i would not have to ask you , i &apos;m very much about the end of the second story before you really get them really comfortable , anybody would get a joke to get a joke , you would forget the subject .
you know , you know the healthy friend of the best , if you get a secret of the best friend , and you get a secret and you will get the best friend , and you get a terrible discussion , and you can &apos;t get a good discussion when you get a bad , and you can &apos;t make that kind of mistakes .
in my about 20 years of training , and financial research , i &apos;ve got a personal medical study about medical errors and wrong applications for so everything i wrote for for one of my first articles that i called white , &quot; white <unk> , &quot; white , &quot; <unk> , &quot; to learn .
the next weeks i made myself and i was for the first time , i &apos;ve been living the healthcare system that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself , not the kind of healthy shame that you &apos;re going to be because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues .
about an hour after that she was at home , and i was going to take her home , she was the family , and the family she brought up to the <unk> , and a blood pressure , that was a dangerous <unk> .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t get my mistakes and talk about it , if i &apos;m the quiet voice , telling me what really happened , how can i share my colleagues ?
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who are not doing it . those who are <unk> and who have no without without any , and with the ones that have been with good outcomes .
we work in a system where one of the most <unk> are either a wrong , in which one of 10 <unk> is either wrong , and the <unk> is always getting and and and and and from the way , or dead .
so , the new part of the doctor is a human being , a human being , is not to make it make a mistakes , but everything everything is going to be made of them , so that it can be passed out .
in fact , i was so much about <unk> , i asked the nurse that she was taking the friend of a living , &quot; do you believe it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and at the end of the day , i would like to drive my stuff , and i went to the parking room to drive the car , when i did something that i didn &apos;t make .
and there &apos;s another nurse , and he didn &apos;t have the sister that &apos;s seen for a little bit of three words , and those three words , most of the time i knew .
and in fact , i would know , or my colleagues know that a <unk> that was a little bit of my hospital would have been doing the wrong , and i would have to look at him in the eyes .
and i sent them home , i put it on my home , i was trying to tell me , &quot; don , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
i &apos;m <unk> the x-ray of the gas &apos;s foot , and when that was no <unk> , my colleague at the patient &apos;s computer was called a <unk> on the lower right and called the <unk> .
and it works in a medical culture that is that people are living with life , and if that &apos;s that , people are too mistake at time .
and i would be able to say that my worst mistake was just in the first five years , which was many of my colleagues , which is many of my colleagues , but complete nonsense .
and then on a day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke , and i said , maybe i could feel better .
and i went back to the same of the same media and -- and i felt , and i was going to go back and go back to work until it was back and again .
oh , you &apos;re going to hear a coffee party , and there &apos;s a lot of people , you know , you &apos;re listening to someone else &apos;s own mistakes .
then i take the same patient with <unk> , and i &apos;ll do it <unk> and give it a easy breath and i think , and i suddenly have a story of the <unk> .
and then your head , you &apos;re sitting in front of the head , and you look down , and you &apos;re hard to tell your stories .
and so , you know , i &apos;ve been thinking about , especially if you think about that in a hospital that &apos;s at the time of only 14 patients .
and i was happy with me that if i put my mind to the end of the time , and never again , a mistake that could be the voice .
two years later , i was in the <unk> of a <unk> hospital in a <unk> hospital , and i was <unk> a 25 year-old man with <unk> <unk> .
so if you take the system like me , i &apos;ve been taught to be taught and all the <unk> <unk> , then there &apos;s no more left .
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure he &apos;d be the whole <unk> and certainly to make sure i couldn &apos;t .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we take the mistakes , the mistakes are the idea that we have a system .
and i was able to do this because they went to the <unk> , and i realized that they would be recover .
it &apos;s the one that &apos;s not saying that what you &apos;ve done is it &apos;s not that you &apos;re too bad .
and it shows others , not to be the <unk> , but in a <unk> , , so that all of them are benefit .
and the nurse was thinking about it , and i said , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;s going to be good at doing it . &quot;
you can see that , but it &apos;s not infection , but it &apos;s not the top of the top , and it causes the <unk> of the <unk> .
they want to be able to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t take the same mistakes that i &apos;m going to be <unk> . &quot;
other other other classes , but the other thing that is very much , but the <unk> is particularly particularly because we see the patients so close .
if i go into a room -- like , like now , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re thinking about .
two days later , i came to my next to my next year , and my <unk> , i asked me to go into a conversation in their office .
in a <unk> view , the medical system all of us have three to three years , we can &apos;t get rid of it .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t put it home , and there was also no <unk> in their treatment .
and he did and he , and he was a <unk> in the right lower sector , called the <unk> .
we have a cognitive error , so we have a perfect <unk> for a patient to take care of a patient &apos;s day .
on the day of the day , she &apos;s going to go -- woman printer , a woman , a woman and grandmother .
they &apos;re both <unk> because we should not look at the problem as we should .
i &apos;m <unk> , but i &apos;m going to try and get the way out there to learn it .
the unique species i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you do in the face .
when did you last time you heard about the last one about <unk> about <unk> <unk> ?
and my patients are not cars ; they &apos;re not telling me their symptoms in the same way .
so i went to the <unk> and a conference and a half and a half , and she brought home .
i <unk> at the time and i was going to put him on my colleagues , and i asked him to be able to get it .
and do you know the <unk> of people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
and after two , three days , it was clear that they would never have back .
and over the course of the eight or nine days , they were <unk> the <unk> .
and then in my worst moments , how did i make a stupid mistake ?
the rest of the day i had this <unk> feeling in my stomach .
&quot; remember the patient you &apos;re going to be home ? &quot;
why do i have the <unk> question ? why do i ask you to home ?
and when he went from the door , he showed him to his his <unk> .
how can i teach my errors , so that you don &apos;t have the same same ?
it &apos;s almost a very complex reaction to antibodies that people don &apos;t take a man .
what they need is a environment that you can get in .
&quot; so she she said , &quot; she &apos;s in this particular kind of <unk> .
and it wasn &apos;t until my <unk> , he was very well .
in the united states , the institute of medicine is the number of 100,000 .
you say that you don &apos;t name the names of the <unk> .
i looked in the <unk> , and it was a little pink pink .
and i gave him a recipe for a prescription and sent him down .
&quot; do you remember the patients with the <unk> ? &quot;
and that was the first time that i learned this myself .
he got <unk> <unk> and a half days later .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely <unk> .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
they want to share their stories . they want to share their stories .
i went home with the <unk> of my home .
if you do <unk> and the mistakes never never done .
and she told the three words : do you get ?
i &apos;m in a <unk> , i &apos;m a <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> and it was really good .
in this state , there &apos;s been about today &apos;s birthday for the <unk> .
i remember it was yesterday .
both of these cases were <unk> me .
i had some of my favorite students in the last five years .
and i went back to work .
the three words : remember , you ?
i was shocked to the inner <unk> .
and that was what i felt .
it was a lot of and i was in a hurry .
it turns out that he was a <unk> .
he had a potentially <unk> disease called <unk> .
that &apos;s the system where we live .
what you need is a new medical culture .
it &apos;s when you talk about their mistakes .
i am a human . i make mistakes .
she was barely able to be blue <unk> .
they put them on the <unk> .
she had not had a <unk> <unk> .
this is the kind of <unk> shame .
but i asked myself to ask these questions .
why did i go to medicine ?
i was thinking , in a while , i was able to have .
it &apos;s a totally different way of mistakes .
she was back and dying .
but it turns out it &apos;s got to be .
i started feeling better .
it &apos;s a lot of money , and no support .
but there are two problems .
i don &apos;t take the same footprint .
all of those are errors .
and it starts with a doctor .
she &apos;s taking their experiences with others .
i am the new jewish doctor .
the <unk> blew all of strands .
and then it happened .
he was always shown here .
and luckily , he died .
the other had strong diarrhea .
and it &apos;s the <unk> .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
my name is brian <unk> .
but i worked on .
so , the nurse goes .
so she was back .
they gave her her <unk> .
her family would be too .
and she did .
and i worked on .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
these people have gone online , but they did have illegal , to put them out of our own <unk> , while we &apos;ve got our <unk> , or also <unk> our <unk> , or <unk> , which our <unk> <unk> on the keyboard , while we have a computer online online online online online
but if you &apos;re going to buy a new <unk> of the world 2011 , a new <unk> , it has a page , it has a page , yellow <unk> on every page , in a pattern that &apos;s going on on them and put your printer on it .
you know , for example , the anecdote that the report of a <unk> <unk> , which is that this area of <unk> was not used , or by <unk> , or not , it &apos;s normally not <unk> , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so that &apos;s the three of these three <unk> : criminals that are doing it for money , like <unk> , which is to use that to be , but the last group are nations , governments who are driving the attacks .
you might think that the problem is people who are certainly , when they lived in <unk> societies , and they were killing , and they were just looking at some generations of what they did .
if you think of &quot; what if you think about &quot; brains &quot; when you think about why people were being touched by the way , from the <unk> , why were they so touched by the ?
the u.s. intelligence <unk> , two months ago this was the swiss director of mr. sam sam , and here we have this talk , and this was a million million dollars in the than it was .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in societies , although we don &apos;t have the sources of the past .
you will confirm it , because the evidence you &apos;re in a earlier form , aren &apos;t like the same thing as you might have to do .
so my worry , the only thing i &apos;m going to give you to respect is to speak , &quot; is &quot; physical ii , &quot; under water .
what about the people who are not possible because they don &apos;t have access to any of the people in the middle of the country ?
and because of that idea , i can explain to you , in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories about the time .
in fact , this is the mountain of all the time , from all of the time , when you drive in areas where they were never been there .
we have the past time that people can &apos;t understand , because the <unk> changes changes , and very low .
and i &apos;m going to argue that today is that we &apos;re victims of a <unk> world , as a machine in the real world .
so , people can see a little and a little bit of the insight that enables it to be their <unk> .
in the &apos; 80s , in the 1930s , in the <unk> , you had to do a little bit of the web , you had to get the government .
and we couldn &apos;t understand the west , and we could do something like this , and how much that would be expected to do .
on the other hand , there are a couple of good things : biodiversity , number of the land , the green one , the green one , the <unk> .
every generation looks at the pictures that you &apos;re looking at at the beginning of their life , as standard and everything that &apos;s made of that .
groups like <unk> are over the last 12 months , and they have become a <unk> of the <unk> on the field of the field .
and this was an example of what our own governments were against the technology , the citizens , the citizens .
this story has a lot of times , from the cell , or other places , is not very much .
<unk> <unk> : the other of this very small , the industrial fishing of this fairly cold ship called <unk> .
the reason is that it &apos;s going to change . it &apos;s a hard reason or coral coral or coral coral .
and it changes changing . it changes because of the people , obviously , their own .
we want things to be , who are gone or things that are not more like they were .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really on the world : we can put these attacks into categories .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> , and the fishermen were good at the time and doing it in ghana .
the most significant part of the fish , the little dots there on the right , the <unk> , were <unk> .
because obviously a animal &apos;s going to be very often , it &apos;s very often rarely , before it &apos;s <unk> .
i went to this , and we went around with the whole southern <unk> ocean and especially in the <unk> .
we fit our new level of the new level and we don &apos;t call ourselves in what was there .
so , we &apos;re looking at the big animals and the sea , and we &apos;re looking at the big fish .
here , i think , the art and the film , maybe the will fill the wall , and my name .
and i got a terrible and i was convinced that i didn &apos;t really know about this .
when i was driving for years later , the fish was going to be the fish of his size .
there are several cases of the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> who have earned their money .
they &apos;re also something else -- something like , a matter of something , or through your audience .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work in africa .
90 percent of our <unk> were in the same way , or other animals that are connected to the cause .
you can see , the <unk> was <unk> and <unk> a few <unk> .
my third little story about my <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
within a year , you can get a pandemic , and then start with the <unk> .
we &apos;re left with the time little fish and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
they found a paper with <unk> <unk> , they could come up with the creator of this thought .
the second <unk> we &apos;re watching today is not through money .
i don &apos;t know what they &apos;re going to do , but i can live .
because i got it out of a chicken in a hospital in a <unk> study .
there was <unk> from about 20 to 20 , <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> .
in the &apos; 70s -- more , the 1960s -- <unk> europe , and many <unk> .
they didn &apos;t eat , they were <unk> away , because they were dead .
of course , many people , scientists , who &apos;s really different .
for example , this is mr. <unk> <unk> from <unk> in the <unk> .
they use <unk> to earn a lot of money , a huge bunch of money .
let me talk with three of my own words : i remember .
you might think that he &apos;s going to be <unk> , but that &apos;s not true .
by the way , in the &apos; 80s , it was very <unk> in the way .
the second story is another concept that &apos;s <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> .
so nothing changed , and yet it changed .
so , the reason was the tail of the deck , and then it was <unk> .
and the reason that the government was able to do , the government could do an animal .
these are brilliant anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so on .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to be worse .
it shows you what governments are , when governments have become their own citizens .
and the fish also was also lucky to be there .
then they wanted to kill them , because they could eat it well .
now , because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
this shows the enormous big role that can play a fish .
and the <unk> and <unk> may remember &quot; &quot; &quot; .
because it &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of that it &apos;s lost in a way .
and this is one of the three <unk> of the existing existing data .
mr. europe itself is on your feet , which is unknown .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started .
now , i know that &apos;s the reason that the cause of the center was .
these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition goes very quickly .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
because through the spaces , we basically do the past .
there was a long time ago -- 500 years ago .
they also had to be a sheet of <unk> from this .
and at the end of the time , they want to get the <unk> .
in our own countries , we would never do something like that .
and the motives of <unk> are very easily .
in the future , most of the world are online online .
there are cases of us who are in the way of <unk> .
i &apos;m going to talk about a little bit , small idea .
you know , he was going to be <unk> .
he described one of them as a very .
now he &apos;s now on the red list of species .
and so it &apos;s not going to be a big loss .
the question is , why are people accept this .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> in the hospital .
but still we still get the president .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the <unk> of the form of the game is still .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
they &apos;re rare because we start them .
i thought i could use it .
if you put it , it happens .
the difference is when loss is .
it can be a order of changes .
that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re going to do .
so you lose no often , you don &apos;t lose .
this is the simulation of the landscape .
people were still happy .
and this is no one that &apos;s <unk> .
it &apos;s about <unk> .
it was my first thing .
two times , they &apos;re five inches .
they were been <unk> .
they were still fish .
this is a dead home .
so , we started a little bit .
she was not <unk> .
it &apos;s not going to be .
you always lose rare animals .
he actually ate fish .
it was a <unk> .
what &apos;s going on here ?
now , that &apos;s what happens .
we have three <unk> .
these people deserve money .
this is the <unk> <unk> .
there are <unk> .
thank you .
stephen &apos;s divide .
<unk> <unk> .
now we &apos;re all using , or a lot of us , or many of us , or one of their classrooms , are particularly common in <unk> states like the state of how to use foreign policy , because they know that they can trust more trust than a local <unk> and they can talk about <unk> , so the local government can &apos;t <unk> the local government
and in this case , in the case of a city of germany , the egyptian government company had sold a pair of programs to have with them -- in very large framework -- any communication of the egyptian citizens .
so , if we think about this , if we think about things , the obvious response of people : &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a citizen citizen .
a few weeks ago , we took <unk> and we gave them some designers that had no kind of -- -- just using wood , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; power , &quot; what .
they use tools like the <unk> to <unk> their computers with a <unk> to <unk> , which allows them to monitor their whole communication communication , their <unk> their <unk> .
and last week , with the signed with the dutch <unk> , i asked one of the senior scientists that he was going to be able to do it because of the people of the people .
for example , in germany , a couple of weeks ago , the so-called <unk> found was a <unk> that was used by german <unk> to their own citizens .
eight years ago , i was working at mit lab , and i started this idea of how to do the power of engineers into the hand of artists and designers .
we want to be the world of the world , the inventor , the world &apos;s most , because the world where we live , this interactive world , we &apos;re all heard .
the transistor was a small <unk> that was us from us from a world of the static , <unk> building building to a world that was all interactive .
and as we today , in 2011 , in 2011 , our governments like this , is that every right we &apos;re going to be able to get forever forever .
they put us in the way that we were getting , buildings , and we have , like , the ones , bridges , a stone after others .
the most beautiful thing is , you start to the electronics that you &apos;re in the everyday , and you don &apos;t learn to learn .
i &apos;m not personally saying that the year of our time is the <unk> , and i decided to change that .
so everything you have to do is to create a blue and a green one and you can connect to a very larger way of building .
so , to slow up the light , or slow , just just just this button , it &apos;s just to slow down the power of faster or slow .
well , in egypt , the interest in april 2011 , the <unk> of the egyptian <unk> , and they found a lot of a lot of music .
and trust we trust , trust of a future , a government , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
well , a certificate , you need a website with <unk> , with <unk> , with <unk> , for example .
take the switch off the switch , and that &apos;s what &apos;s called , and you &apos;ve made a little <unk> .
like a <unk> , a <unk> , or why the doors of the <unk> , or like a <unk> on touch .
so we had , for example , with no medical designer in electronic things that started to play with <unk> material .
the first <unk> were made of <unk> and <unk> a simple idea : <unk> from north america , which would keep all of the time .
it &apos;s been told that over 400 billion stones , or 75 stones for each person on this planet .
now , a little bit of the world &apos;s <unk> , the one in the world , and it &apos;s made a building for our imagination .
like the <unk> , allows us to build a lot of greater , more sustainable more , , a rock after the others .
instead of making them , <unk> or <unk> , to code , allows you to use them with simple , intuitive gestures .
so what about the arab spring and the things that are happened in egypt ?
in the meanwhile , at the same year , the bell was the next revolution , the next building .
so western governments governments governments with governments to deal with their own citizens , to their own citizens .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges , or beautiful building .
if you &apos;re going to be a <unk> , then you &apos;re going to get to a lot of your phone .
for this <unk> , <unk> was another material , electronics , it was another material .
these are the questions that we need to do with the next 50 years .
green is a , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange is cable .
add them up to a extra effect of extra effect , and you have a <unk> .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
you can put a switch in between , and you put a little <unk> .
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a <unk> .
you can go to the website , all the <unk> <unk> and you make them themselves .
it had to be happened in the last fall , because <unk> was been been there .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , sound , and it &apos;s like to be .
and the best part is that they connect to magnet .
they give a blue on a green green , and they can do light .
we want to bring every single interaction in this world to put it in a <unk> stone .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and <unk> , like <unk> ...
it &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> , fear in darkness .
<unk> is a <unk> from the engineers -- or it was this .
they had sold this program for <unk> dollars to the egyptian government .
almost a hundred years later , in the kingdom , was a little bit of a little .
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was only for experts .
the idea behind the idea is that it &apos;s a growing library .
lights , sound , <unk> , motors -- everything should be available .
in this sort of records , a was a <unk> called <unk> .
and within less years , pop homes in every household room .
so the simple thing about it is actually , actually , <unk> .
we have spread in children in the way that they &apos;re looking at .
so , go ahead and catch it .
well , how people die in a consequence of the orange ?
can you turn , if you go to a foreign union .
<unk> , very quickly , the <unk> <unk> in the world .
essentially , the <unk> was become the <unk> of our time .
<unk> are electronic creatures that have a specific function .
but wait , this is really my <unk> .
someone was the shepherd and had the system .
and that &apos;s what happens in the case of <unk> .
it was called the &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
i started developing a couple of years ago .
let me show you how you work .
and we want to make this material for all available .
it &apos;s not decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control .
they can &apos;t be around them .
and his answer was , &quot; yes . &quot;
but western governments also help themselves .
but today we &apos;re very beyond the rest of it .
we &apos;ve got <unk> <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
i don &apos;t have to worry about it .
i don &apos;t hide anything . &quot;
and that makes no sense of meaning .
now , he made all of the time .
and it was an incredible experience .
what do you do with <unk> ?
the <unk> is right here .
they do their own .
privacy is not a debate .
so <unk> is open open .
<unk> is a <unk> .
privacy has to be given .
the stones are <unk> .
i will stop this .
they sell <unk> .
thank you .
