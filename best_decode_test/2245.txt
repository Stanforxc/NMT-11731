you know , one of the great <unk> of travel and one of the pleasure of the research is common to with people who are still to the old days , and the the still still in the the , they &apos;re <unk> out of the .
just the time , that <unk> , or the , or the of the the of of the of the of the inuit of the or the , the the still the still the the still the the to to the , , , in a sense of the , , in a sense of reality , in the , , in a sense of reality , in the , , in a sense of reality , in the , , in a sense of reality , in the , , in a sense of reality , in the , ,
and of course , we all share the same <unk> .
we &apos;re born . we will bring children children .
we go through <unk> .
we have to be through the <unk> of death , and and so , not surprise that we &apos;re all singing , dancing and art .
but interesting , the unique unique tone of the <unk> , the rhythm of dance in everybody culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> of the -- or the the <unk> in haiti , or the warrior in the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , or a <unk> in the the of the , , or , or , in the the of the the .
all of these people teach us that it else else , other other different ways of thinking other ways of ways to use to get to the .
and this is an idea that you think about it , you can only meet hope . hope .
together together , the thousands thousands of cultures of the world of <unk> and <unk> and life that that earth earth is the earth is important as important as the biological <unk> that that you know , as the biological <unk> that you know .
you can imagine this cultural <unk> as a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the the of of thoughts and dreams , of myths , and , ideas and that that people people humans have been driven by the beginning of consciousness .
the <unk> is is great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we are doing as amazing powerful species .
and just as the biosphere was was over , this was the <unk> -- just at the speed of the .
and a biologist , for example , to say that 50 percent or more of all species are just just before the you just not right , and yet , this -- the <unk> <unk> in the the of the of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity .
and the key indicator for this is the of languages .
as any of you were born in this room , been talked been 6,000 languages on the world .
now , a language is not just the of of the or a series of <unk> .
a language is a language of expression of the human spirit .
it &apos;s a means to the the of a a culture of the the world &apos;s the .
any language is like a <unk> forest of mind , a <unk> , a a thought , an an as an ecosystem .
and by those 6,000 languages today , we are now in monterey , , you &apos;re not in the the of the children .
they &apos;re not taught them to be more , that means if nothing &apos;s done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be lonely than being a <unk> be <unk> , one of the be the last of the people who talk to your language , no way to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or expect the hope to expect the children ?
and yet , this awful fate of actually actually someone somewhere on earth , about two two weeks , , because all two weeks , , because all two weeks , die , one man die , and the the last the last of of an <unk> language .
and i know some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; would the world not a better place , if we all just talk a a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be a language . .
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
and then you would see how it would be if you could &apos;t speak own own language .
so i want to to take you in a a journey through the <unk> , a short journey through the <unk> , to try to make them understand what actually lost lost .
now there &apos;s some of us , in a , that , that i i say , &quot; different ways of his , &quot; really different ways of being .
take take take this child , for example , this child in the northwest of the amazon , the people who the people who the the the the the the east the from the eastern journal of sacred .
this is a people who not cognitively between the colors and green , , because the the <unk> the forest is to be on the people .
they have a curious language and a a <unk> that was called the linguistic linguistic <unk> , , you have to marry somebody who &apos;s a different language .
all all all the its roots in the <unk> past . and it &apos;s to to to the <unk> , in the <unk> six or six or seven languages , but that you never hear someone hear someone &apos;s a language .
they &apos;re just to and start talking to .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived in the northeast forests in the northeast ocean , an amazing people , the first the first day in 1958 was first .
in year , , five <unk> <unk> were to to and made a <unk> mistake .
they threw the <unk> photos from from the air , what we would be as an as an as . , forgot that these people have been seen from the rainforest in your life , never had a .
they lifted these photographs from the forest forest , trying to see the face or the the figure , and and <unk> , that that that that that be the business and and killing the <unk> of the .
but the <unk> didn &apos;t kill just outside the heaven .
they &apos;re each other .
<unk> percent of deaths had happened through <unk> .
we &apos;ve been eight eight generations eight generations and found two cases of two cases of death and and when we do people with a a little bit about it , they gave them that one of the people who had so old , and we killed him with <unk> .
but at the same time , they had a of of the forest was amazing .
their their , the the of of a animal &apos;s of , smell , and , and , to what kind of was that guy .
in the early years , i got a really amazing job , i was my professor at harvard , i i interested interested in going to go to to to to to the to the to the the the of <unk> and <unk> and and the poison to be used to make the to use the <unk>
to give a sense of this , , i , i , of course , something about this remarkable belief of the amazing belief and the <unk> is not a &apos;s of the .
in the contrary , it &apos;s a complex kind of a worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i ask you to ask the big religions , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , <unk> , or whatever .
a continent is become out out , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , no religious faith in africa , of course , there &apos;s one and <unk> , is simply the remains of this very deep religious thoughts during the tragic diaspora of the <unk> .
but what &apos;s interesting interesting interesting is this is is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living giving the minds giving the spirits .
the spirits can be <unk> by the great water , , the the on the rhythm of dance to grow up to the the soul , so the the <unk> for a a moment , the god is going to be a for a .
<unk> <unk> the <unk> to say , &quot; white white is going to the church and watch about god .
we dance in the temple and will to god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with that mind , you turn it into the . how can you have harm harm ?
you look at these amazing demonstrations : <unk> in in a <unk> , , the coal coal , which is <unk> , , an amazing graph of the ability to mind the body so that it &apos;s to to the the that it &apos;s <unk> in a state of
well , all of people i met , the <unk> of the sierra <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the most extraordinary .
offspring of the civilization that the the heart of the the , and the the of the the to to the the to to a a <unk> <unk> community , a a <unk> <unk> to to the the <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people the only the only who were never had been by the .
until the day , they will be taken by a ritual priesthood , and the of a priesthood , though , very extraordinary extraordinary .
the young <unk> young will be separated from from three and four years from their families and in a a world of darkness , in <unk> , in <unk> <unk> of the , years of two years of the , , to the the of the pregnancy &apos; <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> in the world of the .
and during that time , they will culturally culturally into the values of their society , values that their claim that their prayers , their prayers , their prayers , the the , , or we might say that the -- balance .
at the end of this amazing , , , you &apos;ll take out one day out , and first time in your life , in the age 18 , you see see a <unk> , and in this <unk> moment of the first light , the the , the the , the the , the the , the the , the the , the the , the the , the the , the the , the the , you know , the the the the <unk> , and the the , you know , the the
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call yourself the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , the the of the world are responsible for the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think about about and and landscape , we &apos;re either <unk> and the old <unk> of the the side of the the end , up , which is a <unk> <unk> thought or <unk> and and , these people are connected to nature than we .
so , native are neither <unk> , , they are not even from the <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t stay much in in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or the cold winds of tibet , but yet , , , , , a <unk> <unk> of the earth which is not not to be , , because of the , , because of the , , because of the , because of the , because of the , because of the , because of the , because of the , because of the , because of the , because of the , because of the , because of the , because of
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid from the <unk> , which in that that the in the that the mountain is a <unk> , or your destiny , your destiny will be a a person , and a a a a of of that , that a a a a that that that you can in a .
whether it &apos;s a a of a mind or a a of a <unk> is is irrelevant .
the the interesting thing is the metaphor that is the relationship between individual individual and the nature .
i grew up in the forests of <unk> colombia and believed that these forests are there to be <unk> .
and i was to to another people as a , as my friends who who believe that these forests of the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the the <unk> minds , the the the the world , the minds to bring spirits out their <unk> .
now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can be able to make different of , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph that i took just last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is <unk> , you &apos;ve heard many of you have , the most powerful <unk> preparation of the repertoire of the <unk> .
so , <unk> <unk> that is not just the potential potential of this <unk> , but it &apos;s it &apos;s actually getting two two various sources . it &apos;s on one hand , there &apos;s this this wooden <unk> , , , , , , and , <unk> , , , and , and , a a of of <unk> , , and it &apos;s a a <unk> of a <unk> , , and it &apos;s a <unk> of a <unk> , , and it &apos;s a <unk> of a <unk>
and this plant has some very strong <unk> that that the serotonin , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> , , you you this stuff stuff , this substance that are also creating different kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds .
this powder is more about about a <unk> in a <unk> , , <unk> <unk> <unk> paintings , and the land on a a of electricity .
it &apos;s not <unk> of reality , it &apos;s the the of reality .
i even actually , with my professor , richard evan <unk> , who who who the the <unk> <unk> with the the to the the to the the the the the <unk> years , and i argued that that i think that you can &apos;t be a <unk> , , because you can &apos;t see the effects of the .
but the thing about the is that they can &apos;t be taken by by , because they , in the human gut , of , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , name .
you can only take to with some other chemicals in the <unk> of mao <unk> .
now , the fascinating thing is that the <unk> that contain the in the <unk> , , of the of the way that are necessary to be the to <unk> the <unk> . ask yourself .
how can these people from a of of 80,000 miles of two two <unk> these two two <unk> these two <unk> these two things that , if , if it &apos;s combined , kind of a version of the , so that the whole whole of of the the sum of your parts is ?
we use this great greed , attempt and mistakes what what was happening to meaningless meaningless .
but you ask the indian , they say , &quot; the plant is talking to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , 17 have 17 million of them in the forest that which is to our eyes as a way .
and then you ask them how to launch her <unk> , and they say , &quot; i thought you know something about plants .
i mean , you know nothing at all ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that you take each of the 17 to <unk> and and you sing one in a different <unk> .
now , that doesn &apos;t give a a at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than count .
now , the the problem is that the the that even those of us who have the for for the difficult capacity of native , , and , but they somehow look at the past , , , the world , , , the world , , .
so , in the , , you &apos;re not going to the the the the the years , or not for the or or technical innovation , but rather than a era of we were present , and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity , the the , or not the the problem is not the change .
all cultures have have involved in the dance with new new .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> don &apos;t heard less to sioux , when they and and and and and to be american americans didn &apos;t stopped being american , they horse and <unk> .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of the <unk> , . it &apos;s . it &apos;s the ugly face of the .
and wherever you have in the world , you will discover that these cultures are not not the extinction , , these are dynamic living peoples that are <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the the of the the the <unk> , , or the the the the the the the <unk> , or the the the the the <unk> , or the the the the <unk> , or the the the the <unk> , or the the the the <unk> , or the the the the the <unk> , or the the the the the <unk> , or the the the the the <unk> , or the the the the the <unk> , or the the the the the <unk> , or the the the the the <unk> , or the the the the the <unk> , or the the the the the <unk> of the <unk> , or the the the the the the <unk> , or the the of the <unk> , , or the the the the the the
or if we go into the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m a lot of a , you will see the ugly face of the of the . .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> of people &apos;s <unk> of people &apos;s <unk> , but the <unk> of the people of people , not not not &apos;t not &apos;t not , but they were <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand the don &apos;t understand it , if you have seen it on <unk> level .
i &apos;d been a with a young colleagues at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and and when i walked down , and i came to the , the the the of the the , and , and , and <unk> <unk> , , 1.2 million people during the cultural revolution during the cultural revolution .
the father of this young <unk> was identified as a <unk> lama .
that meant that that he was killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle bug with its holiness to the diaspora to take people .
his mother was locked in as as as as as as the crime .
he was been in the age of the in in the prison to hide underneath her <unk> , because it couldn &apos;t live him .
the sister who did this brave did became became a <unk> .
one day she stepped on on a <unk> <unk> and and for these <unk> , , for this <unk> , to to a a .
the suffering is <unk> , , , but the <unk> spirit of people is a little bit more . .
and at the end , we are really a choice . we want to do in a a world world of the , or in a a world world of diversity ?
margaret <unk> , the great anthropologist told that it was that it &apos;s their greatest fear that while we &apos;re in a sequence , <unk> , , , , , , not just all the the of the the of the , , but we &apos;d never seen a a of of a , and , but we &apos;d have to to a a of a a , and
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species might have been since years .
the <unk> revolution that brought us us us , and in this moment , in this moment of the <unk> of the <unk> , the poetry of the priesthood of palestinians and and and and and -- -- -- just 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this suggestion story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we &apos;re in the the millennia .
if we think these these thousands of <unk> questions about the human questions , they &apos;re to each other to each other .
and in this song , we will going to be the possibility to be that we are , people are the with no conscious consciousness , are the importance of the importance of the to to to be able to be able to be able to be a a , and , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took the the northern <unk> of the , when i went to <unk> <unk> , and this man , <unk> , , i told me a wonderful story of his grandfather &apos;s grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very well with the inuit , and during the <unk> of the the of of our our , , were forced to to to hit in settlements .
the grandfather &apos;s about the <unk> refused to be .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the weapons and all the tools .
now you you know that the inuit have no afraid of the cold , they they they use them to their advantage .
the <unk> of their <unk> , originally originally originally , that was in in <unk> , made .
the man &apos;s grandfather didn &apos;t frightened until the the of the the , or the the storm .
he <unk> out out , his pants off down <unk> down down his hand , and when the because when they &apos;re to <unk> , they started to the the the shape of a <unk> .
he <unk> on on the pages of the and and it was fully frozen , he was a a dog .
he <unk> the dog and and the <unk> a a , , the the dog , and <unk> a <unk> , <unk> a another , and <unk> <unk> on the <unk> on the the with the <unk> .
so you can do something like anything .
and this is in many ways of the the of the inuit of the inuit and all around the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in april april 1999 , the complete control of an area , which is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new home home and called <unk> .
it &apos;s an international field . it &apos;s all the <unk> .
an amazing example , like one nation , one nation , a state , who are <unk> for people and and .
and ultimately , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who &apos;ve been to those distant goals of the the the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not gone all .
they are the <unk> of of someone .
they represent part of the human imagination that <unk> in times , and all of us , the dreams are going to be the dreams of the kids are the of of the of of the .
what we eventually , in national geographic , is that we think that politicians never get something .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not convincing , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and we &apos;re probably the best best in in the world , our our website is 35 million <unk> million of . month .
<unk> nations send our <unk> .
our magazines are read by by millions .
and we &apos;re a a series of travel in the <unk> , which we our our our audience to be these many of such cultural signals that you &apos;ve <unk> by the the the the the central to the central women of the , that that that world , that that that that that that that that the wisdom of all of us , that that that that that that that the wisdom of all of us to have a a a really multicultural <unk> world that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that
thank you .
what i first can you first is as quickly as possible , show is the basic work , a new technology that we microsoft is a a of a a a a year , we &apos;ve got to , and it &apos;s an environment , and it &apos;s an environment , and it &apos;s an environment , you can get huge numbers of visual or away .
we see a lot of lot of digital digital of digital photographs that you and and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at how big these these these these these collections , or big the images are images .
most of you are the photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan of the <unk> , and it &apos;s in a <unk> of of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t matter difference , because the only thing that can be the the of the world as is is the the of on on screen on a screen , it &apos;s a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house of dickens . every column is a chapter .
and to prove that it &apos;s really really about a a and not an image , we can do something that do to really show that that this real representation of the and and no picture is .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a <unk> . .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that is what you really really have the pleasure and the good experience of reading a a a a magazine a newspaper , a newspaper newspaper , which is a kind of medium in
we also have something at the corner of this particular issue of the guardian .
we &apos;ve designed a wrong with with very high resolution that are much higher than a normal ad , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see here .
or other models , or even , , , , .
and this really really these ideas to be these constraints for the place in the screen .
we hope that that &apos;s not a <unk> and other nonsense means that that it should not be necessary .
and of course , that that that the of really obvious applications for technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time , except for that we will going to be going to this this area .
but these are all the streets in the u.s.
<unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the nasa &apos;s painting .
let &apos;s take something else .
now , this is actually live on the internet . they can <unk> it .
this is a project called <unk> , which is really two different different of technologies .
one is <unk> , and the other is a very good research on <unk> <unk> , who from noah <unk> , a university university of washington , at the <unk> of steve <unk> .
and rick <unk> was done to research , a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by <unk> .
you can see that , if we can create these kinds of views where we can go through images and and this experience of the .
but the spatial way of is is actually , of meaning .
and the <unk> have these these these these these to the the real space , where these these footage that they were all near the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the canadian <unk> , , you &apos;re seeing here from <unk> slides , or <unk> , and these things are all all in the in .
i don &apos;t know if i have time to show you other environments .
there are are that are much more <unk> .
i &apos;d like to to put one of the most <unk> prize prize , and this is from a early prototype of <unk> that we first worked in the summer , to show you that , what i think is that really , the the of this technology , which is not necessarily as much as you see the the environments that we &apos;re at the the .
we had to worry about the lawyers of so so .
this is a <unk> of the cathedral , , which was just in computer computer at the computer , and you just the dame lady in flickr at a , and you &apos;ll going to take images of men in t-shirts and on the . .
so this is all <unk> , and they all all in in in in in the way .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
you know , i never never believed that i end up working in microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception reception here .
and i guess you can see that this is a lot of different types of cameras : all the things that is , in the , , a a a number of of them , which are all of them in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the curious .
many of them are them from them them .
somewhere here are a number of photographs -- here are are .
this is actually a poster about 103 lady , was recorded .
we can move from poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment , it &apos;s now collected data from all of the -- from all the collective store of how , visual the earth looks like , , and everything will connected to each other .
all these pictures are connected to each other and and it something that bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes from all earth earth .
look at this as the sequel of the work of from on virtual earth earth .
and that is something that that that that that people use it , and it &apos;s use it for the users use the application of the application .
their own photos are get <unk> <unk> , which has a other person .
if someone did it her her and and all of the holy and and tells who you all all , my photo will be <unk> , <unk> , all of this data , and i can use it as a place to use to use , and use to use the other of of <unk> , and use use of other people , to use use of other people , and use
and of course , byproduct of all its very rich models of the rich models of each of the earth that not only not only by <unk> or or or or or or so on , but through collective memory .
thank you .
do i understand it right ? her software is that at a point , within the next years , all images , in in in the world in in the world is be connected to each other ?
yeah . it &apos;s nothing else .
if you want to make it up between the images .
and it does this because of the content in the .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the abundance of the information that are have many of these images .
as if you do a <unk> of for pictures , where they do and and the the text of the website , a of information that is the picture .
but how about this picture , if you &apos;re to to touch with all their pictures ?
then the amount of <unk> <unk> and the the of that is that makes it really , it &apos;s really a classic <unk> .
blaise , this is incredible . <unk> congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;ll tell you some things about my book , i hope , in in with other things you &apos;ve heard about , and i &apos;m going to try to try some connections , if you don &apos;t noticed these .
i want to start what i call &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all the western western societies .
the official <unk> works like this : if our goal is to maximize the common of of our citizens , it &apos;s through the most of of the .
the reason for this is that freedom is good in yourself , valuable , make sense , a a premise for human human .
if people have freedom , then each of us are about to do things for the to do our good our good and and no one to decide .
the path to maximize is to maximize .
the more choices people , the more freedom , and the more freedom , and the more freedom you have , the more good you have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply , that it would be no to to question .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
i &apos;ll give you some examples of what &apos;s modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say briefly about about <unk> .
there are <unk> <unk> in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t have the 10 extra <unk> <unk> , and 12 <unk> and you could buy buy a number of <unk> <unk> <unk> in the unlikely case that no one has ever in the place for you .
so this is how the supermarket is .
and then they go to the <unk> business store to a a for a car stereo , speaker , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , , , and in this one that there &apos;s so many <unk> facilities .
we can have <unk> million different <unk> of of <unk> of the the components that are being offered in this one business .
you have to admit that that &apos;s a big choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , you could have got every phone , you wanted to get he he he he &apos;d been he &apos;d been he was he was he was
they rented her phone . you didn &apos;t bought it .
and a result of that was that the phone never broken broken .
those days are over .
now we we have an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile mobile phones .
my favorite is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and if you &apos;ve never seen that until you can &apos;t have in their business , you can be sure that they &apos;ll be soon .
and what it does is it it &apos;s people to walk into business and put this question .
now you know what the answer is this question ?
the answer is no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cell that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life , that are much more <unk> than buy the things are are for , but the same explosion of choices choices .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states they go to the doctor and the doctor tells tell you what to do .
instead , instead of the doctor , and the doctor tells you , we could do a a , or we could do b .
a has has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do they want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what am i going to do ? &quot;
the doctor says a a has has this benefits and risks and and and the benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not not them . &quot;
the the result is -- we call it autonomy , &quot; this is like a good thing , but in reality is a is a is a responsibility for the of of the of of something knows anything that &apos;s a a and and absolutely sick , and the patient &apos;s the patient &apos;s
there &apos;s a tremendous marketing for for for people for people like you and me , that , if you think about it , you don &apos;t think of it , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they do us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is they expect to to the the next to the next morning and to to to to a a change .
so something as a as our identity is now a question of choice , how this slide is supposed to show .
we don &apos;t <unk> identity ; we invent them .
and we invent so often as we want to .
that means that every every day , wake up tomorrow , you you to decide what to be a kind of person .
it &apos;s about marriage and family , it was a time when the <unk> was that almost everybody had had one and and they could do it as well as they could , and then kids could do as they could .
the only one was , &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did .
now , &apos;s just to have .
i teach teaching beautiful intelligent students , and i give you 20 percent less work than i used to .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , you wonder , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry ? ?
should i marry ? ? should i have to kids , or not &apos;t do a career ? &quot;
they &apos;re all <unk> questions .
and you &apos;re going to be whether those questions are whether that means that that means that you the tasks i i you to get a good note in my course .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to <unk> questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed how carl think think that technology technology has to make us to every minute of each place on the planet -- until the <unk> hotel hotel .
and by the way , there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m not going to tell you that the the .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice choice we have in work in work , and again and again again , again , we should work work or not work .
we can watch our children in football football , and we have our mobile phone on a hip , and our through through other other , and our our laptop on our our lap .
and even if you &apos;re all off , every minute in the , in the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> , we we ask , &quot; should we call call call call this call ?
should i learn this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even though the answer to the question , &quot; no , it &apos;s certainly going to be your experience of the experience of their child &apos;s experience very different than it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and small things things things , and lifestyle lifestyle , life is a matter of choice .
and the world in we lived in this .
i want to say , there are some choice , but not all was a question of choice .
and the world that we &apos;re in now life like this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to about what is bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
an effect , a <unk> way that he &apos;s <unk> .
so many options you can vote , it &apos;s people to to to to to .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of of a study in a made a in volunteers .
one colleague of mine had access access to <unk> <unk> , <unk> , the giant <unk> of about a million staff and two million countries .
and what she found was 10 <unk> of the company company took the two percent .
they provide 50 <unk> -- -- 10 percent less staff -- if you five five or , why ?
because it &apos;s 50 <unk> that are are the choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide what to decide what you to keep it in tomorrow .
and tomorrow tomorrow and tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow , tomorrow .
you know , that &apos;s not only that that &apos;s food food food if you need to go into retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go to his , , it also means that they &apos;re also the the that they &apos;re miss the the of their their
by not , , to 5,000 to 5,000 $ a year on the <unk> , , had happy to be .
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices .
and i think it makes what the world looks like .
you want to make the really really when it &apos;s for all the , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the false investment , or it &apos;s wrong with the wrong .
so this is an effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end up with the result of the , , we we the the we had the the we had the the we had less opportunity to
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is based upon the big choice of different from a , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and that &apos;s a perfect process of perfect , , it &apos;s just to imagine that they have a different decision , and what &apos;s going to be the time that they have made the decision , and what &apos;s going to be the time that you have made the decision , and what &apos;s going to be the time that you have made the decision , and what &apos;s going to be
the more possibilities there , the more easier is it &apos;s not at that time , it &apos;s so so that you .
secondly , what economists call <unk> <unk> .
dan gilbert has made a big point in by doing how how much the way we can these things , on what it depends on what we &apos;re .
well , if there are lots of alternatives to think about it , it &apos;s kind of attractive properties of alternatives that you you , , makes you less content with the alternatives that you chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those who are not new york , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what they should have been .
here &apos;s a a of the the .
very expensive real real .
beautiful beautiful . nice . . you have it all for themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she thinks it &apos;s august . &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could park in front of my house . &quot;
and he spends 2 weeks from the idea that he could be able to touch the day day day , day , a a a lot of a .
<unk> <unk> the that we can get through our choice , even if we &apos;ve chosen to do .
and the more possibilities there are choices , the more attractive properties of this choice will into into the <unk> .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon some some some of the story .
he &apos;s a a statement about living now and perhaps to to things slowly .
but one important thing that he is : always who is to decide to decide to decide not to decide to do other things .
and these other things like many attractive properties , and it &apos;s going to do what they &apos;re going to do less .
three : <unk> of expectations .
this was me met when i wanted to exchange . jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which was was in a kind of way , and they bought them , and they &apos;ve them bad , they were incredibly <unk> , and when they had enough enough and and enough , they &apos;d have had , &quot; &quot; ,
so , to to new jeans , for many years of the <unk> of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the <unk> said , &quot; you want to <unk> , easy to <unk> or good ?
do you want to buttons buttons or <unk> ? rock or acid ?
do you want to jeans jeans ?
you &apos;re to cut , , blah blah blah blah blah ... &quot; and he he told .
my pine tree , and after i , i , i said , &quot; i would the the way that was the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what this was , so i spent an hour for all this damn jeans , and the the business -- and i say the truth -- and i the best best best right i had ever had
i had better . all of that choices that it me it it better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain myself .
the reason that i felt bad bad , with all of these all of these -- , my expectations for what a good for a good , , up .
i had very low expectations . i had had particular expectations when it was just in in a way .
when you came to 100 species , , , , , a of them would be perfect .
and what i was well , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared to what i had to do what i was expected to and what was was was was than what i was expected .
add the in the lives of people , inevitably inevitably the expectations of people people think about how well they are are .
and this is too less happiness with results , even when the results are good .
no one in the world of the <unk> knows this because because if you would , you wouldn &apos;t know what you &apos;re all about here .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that used to be better than worse than bad was worse than it was bad for people to make experience experience experience of the experience .
today , in the world we live in -- we &apos;re wealthy , industrialized , with perfection as expectation , the best thing you can hope is the is as good as you are it it .
you never never really yourself because because because your expectations , my expectations , <unk> .
the secret to the <unk> -- that &apos;s what they &apos;ve come to -- the secret to the are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short moment moment -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have better better . i didn &apos;t have .
but <unk> is not always a bad thing .
ultimately , a a of of a a a a bad tune when if there &apos;s only one way to buy that if you &apos;re been , and you ask yourself why why is is that is , the the is responsible . what would you do ?
if you &apos;re hundreds of different kinds of jeans , and you buy one a disappointing , and you ask why why is is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is the question : it &apos;s .
they could better better better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so when people make decisions , and even when the outcomes are good , you feel feel disappointed about it , they &apos;re themselves .
clinical depression was the in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a <unk> -- not the only , but a <unk> <unk> of of the depression , depression , and , also finding that people have been their because because they have have their standards , and then if you have to explain your own , , think of you .
and so the is that that it &apos;s to us to do it , generally , and we feel worse .
so let me remember you .
this is the official <unk> that we all of that , right , is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no a question , which is a little better than no , but it &apos;s not , , &apos;s more choice than something .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we finally missed this point for our good our good our good our good .
now , as a a question -- i &apos;m almost done -- a a question question , is the thing about about the thing that is about the the , which is what this is going to the developed in the developed system is the the of wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard many of many of them whose problem is not the to the big choice .
your problem is that they have too little .
so things things i &apos;m talking about is a curious problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating , and &apos;s is , steve <unk> has told them about about how this expensive and expensive and hard to do it , it &apos;s a a of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that this expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that that you &apos;t do .
they even hurts .
they &apos;re concerned for that there .
if something of what we allow for people to make our society to our society to those societies have to have a to a little choice , not only that lives of people , but it would also be improved .
economists call this a an application application .
<unk> is going to be that it &apos;s better -- not just the poor -- -- because all of these are the big choice .
finally , you , you , this cartoon , and , a tradition , says , &quot; ah ! what does this know ?
you know nothing to happen in this <unk> . &quot;
<unk> imagination , a <unk> of of the world -- and that is the way i read read it first .
and the more i thought about it , the more i i to the that that &apos;s a little bit .
because the truth is that if you break the <unk> , so that everything is possible , they don &apos;t have freedom . they have paralysis .
if you break the <unk> , so that everything is possible , she it it .
you increase paralysis and lower it . happiness .
everyone needs a <unk> . .
this is almost almost with with , as well as the fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> is his <unk> of a metaphor is a recipe for misery , and i guess , i , i , .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects projects before , talking about the human genome and what that mean , and about the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we have digitized biology , and now we try to to the digital code into a new phase of biology , by creating new new .
we &apos;ve always tried to to questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something i think that many biologists to to understand and to understand and at different kinds of different .
we have to to to to to to the different components .
we &apos;ve digitized nearly 20 years . when we sequenced the <unk> , made the shift from the analog world of biology to the digital world of the .
now , we try to ask whether we can we can your life , or do we create life new life , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a little organism , <unk> <unk> , which is the smallest genome of a species that can replicate themselves in the lab , and we tried to do that to do that with one still .
we &apos;ve managed to rid of the hundred genes about the of the 500 or so that are .
but if we look at these deep map , which is very simple , compared to our , trust me , that &apos;s simple , but if we &apos;re looking at these genes we we &apos;re looking at this one of the , it &apos;s very unlikely that that would lead to a living
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to the front of this chromosome , actually what we allows us to vary the individual components and and to ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , we we a a ?
do it really going to do these really big molecules , and it was never done before ?
and if we can we can we can start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of <unk> chemical chemical material .
our steps in <unk> of the &apos;s of .
our ability to be our genetic code , very slowly , but still increased , and our final point now on this this .
we started started with 15 years ago .
it took took a few years with a <unk> review before we made the first experiments .
and it turns out that &apos;s very difficult to be .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world can make the little pieces of dna , and 30 to 50 letters , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you you do a piece , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to make a new method of which we could put these little pieces and and the mistakes .
this was our first attempt to start with the digital with the digital x x x , .
it &apos;s a little virus of bacteria .
we made little pieces , made a <unk> and and a dna molecule , and a a of of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting stage , we came to this piece of <unk> chemical , and put into a bacteria , and it was the bacteria that started read the genetic code and made the viral particles .
the you have the viral particles from they released released and and , and made e. e. . .
and i &apos;ve talked to the oil industry , and they said that this is exactly what this kind of understand .
they laughed more than you do it here .
so &apos;s how we think that &apos;s a situation in the software is actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go a lot more , we wanted to build an an <unk> chromosome . it has more than <unk> letters genetic code . so we we we we &apos;re building it in the size of the <unk> , to understand what the the of the <unk> can can can the the the of the the .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in computers computers , you have to really be really accurate .
when we sequenced the genome first first first , , the the <unk> in a a .
we found the the <unk> , and we we used the the original sequence , it would never be possible .
part part of the design is to make pieces of the 50 letters are and and have to have to have to have to to building smaller <unk> to build smaller .
we have unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built into the .
think about it : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t. and
these letters -- these letters -- these these -- these -- these -- 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s one single destiny for every of these amino acids .
so we use use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
at first , we only signed .
some people were disappointed that there was no poetry .
we have the so we that we could just them them ; they are enzymes enzymes these these repair and and together and meet together .
and we &apos;ve starting to start starting with pieces , starting with pieces of five to <unk> letters in <unk> , these these each other in these together to make these <unk> together , to <unk> .
in each step , we have these pieces of the ; we could actually sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process to what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get the to the the .
so , this looks like a <unk> . .
if we &apos;re to to see this really big pieces -- with over 100,000 base -- -- then they don &apos;t grow in in e. coli . it <unk> all the the modern modern molecular biology , and we went our other mechanisms
we knew about about a mechanism mechanism in the <unk> that the biology uses biology to fix the dna that that that pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s an organism called <unk> <unk> <unk> three three three .
you see in the top field that his chromosome falls apart apart .
12 to 24 hours 24 hours later , it was all the way it was .
we have got thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be perfectly <unk> , they can even in in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life in space exist in space and moving to to looking for <unk> conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there are a lot out there .
here &apos;s a <unk> of of the molecule that we &apos;ve created by using these these processes -- actually , we only used to use <unk> with the the right design of the pieces , we put it
this is not a <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the <unk> .
these are footage about about a long time .
this is the publication that we &apos;ve only been finished .
these are over <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> code . it &apos;s the biggest molecule with <unk> structure that ever created by humans .
it &apos;s got a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we could it with a <unk> of 10 and without <unk> -- <unk> , , just just just just just just just just to start this genetic code .
now , how do we going to start chromosome ? how do we activate ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s a a virus , it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier than you &apos;re in in <unk> , , it &apos;s , you just take out the nucleus , and there &apos;s one other in , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve heard about
in <unk> , the chromosome in the cell , but we recently , we shown that you &apos;ve shown you a complete a of of a chromosome of one cell to the other and can these activate .
we <unk> the chromosome of a <unk> . roughly , , are these two two from another two plants , and we gave a few of <unk> to to this chromosome . we we to break it down to the , and it was very amazing to destroy all the the , and it was very amazing to destroy it in a cell , and it was very amazing to
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we tried to to get the process to further .
this is the <unk> of evolution here .
we find all kinds species species here have a a chromosome or a third of <unk> , each times , , each one of the characteristics in one second , a species .
so people who imagine imagine imagine a gene is a a point of a a time , by by . .
there are enzymes called the <unk> called the <unk> , actually digest .
the chromosome in the cell was has no ; the chromosomes we &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve
it was in the cell , and the other chromosome as a alien material , and so we had at the end of the end , a new chromosome .
it &apos;s <unk> that we &apos;ve had in the .
and after a very short time , it had all been all of the species and and completely completely to a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve the in the cell .
all the proteins , the the material changed -- -- we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve .
it may sound like &#93; &#93; , but we can move by by the the <unk> , things quite dramatic dramatic dramatic .
now i i argued that this is not the <unk> -- it &apos;s based on a billion years evolution .
and i argued that that we might possibly make a new form of the cambrian explosion explosion that has a massive new of of of the to to this digital .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re the about six billion billion people in the next 40 years .
in in my my , i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet for in in in , , within 40 years , it &apos;s four . four .
we have the with food , fresh and water , medicine , fuel fuel , <unk> billion people .
it will going to offer that for nine .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion calories of oil . this are hundreds hundred million people a day .
if we think about biological processes or any process , replace it , it will be a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all of this material ends up in the atmosphere .
we &apos;ve now , from our discoveries from all over the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that that the the of the future .
the the had a dozen components and look at the diversity of it &apos;s out of this .
and we &apos;re taking the first of the biological of biological and and of our notion of our . .
we have now technologies technologies today because of this fast <unk> to do what we call <unk> genetics .
now we have a possibility to build a large robot that will build a a of of the .
if you imagine imagine , 20 million different different genes , or to these these processes to make a new vaccines , , new vaccines , we can make a little more molecular biology than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> production , <unk> <unk> , or <unk> and so on .
this is a of of real <unk> of we work on that you actually actually sit down and and new new species of the computer are smart smart .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it will look like . we know exactly what the genetic code is going to look like .
we &apos;re now on to the the fourth generation .
you saw saw a a of of a a , and you have seen a a bad experiment .
we have a of of <unk> and third generation , the is become the bigger world are are going to be a lot higher <unk> , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but , as we think , the only way of biology can do a big impact without more increase in the cost of food , the the is being able to see the as material material , and we &apos;re working on the material , and we work work
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first first to the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a way of
but in our discovery of the world , we all all sorts of different different ways .
this is an organism that we &apos;ve been in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , <unk> <unk> .
it co2 co2 co2 co2 co2 carbon dioxide using hydrogen as a source source energy .
we we &apos;re going to use carbon co2 co2 , which could just be to <unk> , , that can go co2 into fuel , to drive this process .
within a short period of time , we we we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really really -- <unk> goals , like the <unk> of the the <unk> of the the <unk> . . . right . if you don &apos;t do that at ted ted , you can &apos;t get any of the energy .
but the same way we &apos;re working on now is to use the the the the to the .
you &apos;ve seen it this year with flu , we &apos;ve always been a year and and a a a a a little when it &apos;s about the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by creating <unk> vaccines in the <unk> .
this is what the future might be like with changes can be the the can be <unk> with synthetic bacteria , <unk> bacteria , and , and perhaps <unk> .
we &apos;re very to better people . and our goal is to to be that we have a have a have a have a a have a to do that . thank you .
at the last ted conference , i was a introduction to a lhc .
and i promised to come to to them how how the machine works .
so it &apos;s , so , for all of those who were &apos;t there , the the who the lhc has ever found the biggest scientific experiment ever found -- 27 kilometers in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that was less than a <unk> of the the -- -- and to 600 to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine below the geneva .
we take pictures of these <unk> in detectors .
this is what i work is . it &apos;s called atlas called the -- 44 meters in the , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of atlas atlas basically the to you the scale .
last year , the last year , the machine for the first time .
and this image was taken taken taken of atlas atlas .
it &apos;s got huge <unk> in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> that entire entire entire entire the the the lhc , then with a part of the lhc <unk> to to an rain to the to the
in other words , when we saw this image 10 10 , we knew that the machine is works , what &apos;s a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this was the the largest <unk> <unk> , or this , when the google page , and the front page .
it means that we reached a cultural influence next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with this this , to this this , this this golden wires here .
these wires <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine &apos;s on on <unk> .
now , the engineers who are them , and say , &quot; no , &quot; no don &apos;t do that . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you cool down very far , they &apos;ll called the <unk> .
so at minus <unk> degrees , colder than the space between the stars , these these wires can use tension tension .
in one of the connections , between <unk> magnet , the lhc , there was a <unk> . .
and it heat up and and and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
now , all of you &apos;re <unk> when you you imagine that that that that that up over tons tons tons tons and moving around about 30 centimeters .
so we damaged million of 50 50 the magnet .
and they had to take them , what we did .
we <unk> them , they <unk> them .
they &apos;re all back back to her way .
by the end march march is going to be <unk> .
and we &apos;ll turn it on , and we &apos;ll find it the first data in june , or july , and we have our journey , to find out what the blocks of the the the universe .
now , of course , in a sort of <unk> like this <unk> , the the debate about science and <unk> of science and it &apos;s easy to it . it &apos;s just to to .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to reach our our to our boundaries , it &apos;s worth of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to have my <unk> words about a english scientist . <unk> <unk> , who , who i guess when he was the the of his <unk> was his his , his his , was michael <unk> , and this is a <unk> that that that that &apos;s a <unk> that that that that we have a <unk> that that that that &apos;s not a that that that we have a <unk> that that that &apos;s going to be that that &apos;s not
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
and &apos;s my job , but it &apos;s more of course , more than that .
it &apos;s also my great , life love and fascination .
and i expect that that ever will ever change .
but recent recent a little weird in my life and my career has been me to to think about that work .
this strange clue that this strange event , a a a a a called a a called <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love love -- -- , love , but , but , in the previous books , went out of the world and find a big <unk> , international international health . .
and the result is that i i , i i , i , i will be to the extinction .
seriously -- the end .
for example , they come to to me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you think that they never never ?
have you not afraid that they &apos;re having your whole life and never created a book , and will be to someone in the world ? ? ?
okay , that really makes the courage .
but it would be , if i &apos;m not remember that i was about about 20 years ago when i first told that i was a writer , i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of <unk> reaction .
people said , &quot; <unk> , you don &apos;t afraid to have never succeed ?
did you not afraid that you killing the humiliation of a <unk> ?
you don &apos;t think you &apos;re not afraid that you have a for for your life and and you will never going to be a a <unk> dreams , you will be to be a <unk> <unk> of the failure ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer is all these questions : <unk> <unk> .
yeah , i was afraid of all of these things .
and i had always had .
and i have a lot more of a lot of things that no one would be a .
like algae -- and other things things .
but if it &apos;s about about about , i think thinking about about , and i &apos;m thinking , why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it logical that that someone supposed to be expected that he was afraid to do the work to do work ?
and what is exactly the creative other , we we &apos;ll make really insecure about the the of of health -- in a way that other other don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , , chemist , i can remember remember in his for me as a chemist , he he he was afraid to be . .
with your <unk> , john john -- how about it ?
it just wasn &apos;t just , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists didn &apos;t have the the of the <unk> of <unk> .
we we seem to have , but we have to have a of of reputation , but not just the writers , but the creative all of the <unk> have to have been highly immensely unstable unstable .
all you have to do is to be <unk> <unk> <unk> really <unk> <unk> of the 20th century , the 20th , young and often died of their own .
and even those who don &apos;t actually <unk> <unk> , , , from from the to to become neglected .
norman <unk> said before he said , his death last last : <unk> every of my books , a little bit more .
a extraordinary statement that you can do about your life .
but we don &apos;t even get to say if we hear someone something because because we &apos;ve heard this kind of story since so long , , we kind of have the the , and collective accepted that creativity and and that , that art -- and that art -- -- the -- -- the -- -- the
the question i want to do is is to you here is this is this idea for you ?
you you feel that ? because with one centimeter in the ... i feel like i &apos;m not at this notion of this .
i think they they are .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how they put the the next century .
i think it better when we &apos;re our to to our great creative of our .
and i definitely definitely that it for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , start to start this dark path of <unk> , , in the fact that i &apos;m in my my career in my career .
that &apos;s -- i &apos;m -- i &apos;m quite a young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i have still more <unk> <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s probably that everything i &apos;m going to be about about the world as the world as the the world is the the the of my my last book , , right ?
i say it <unk> , because we &apos;re now sort of of friends in some of friends -- it &apos;s probably very likely that my biggest biggest is my biggest success is me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thought that can start to start at 9 a.m. the the the the , , , and i don &apos;t want to .
i would continue to continue to work that i love love .
so the question is : how ?
after a long time of the , , i , i to to to write to write a kind of <unk> build build a kind of <unk> build build .
somehow , i to to find a way to write a way to write a a a , between me and and i my very natural <unk> about how the response is going to be the .
and i &apos;ve been for for for for for for for , i &apos;ve been looking for the past , and i tried to find other societies to see whether you might be better or more <unk> ideas about how to create the emotional risks that we as we could help to create the emotional risks with the emotional risks that we are to to with the emotional
this search led to to patient greece and the ancient rome .
please , me , because the circle will close .
but in the ancient greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity is coming , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> , who had a from a distant , unknown source of people -- from <unk> , , , unknown reasons .
the greeks called this <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> <unk> .
from socrates , known that he believed he had a <unk> that he had a <unk> <unk> .
the the said the same idea , called this kind of <unk> creative creative creative , so a genius genius .
this is great . the the said that a a genius had a particularly good good .
they believed that a genius of the kind of magical magical , that that that it was literally in the walls of a <unk> <unk> -- -- like <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the work that would be a invisible <unk> and and artists of work work .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s &apos;s this , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construction that protect you from your work .
and everybody knew that it was that , right ?
and artist artist was was protected , some of things , like , for example , , , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at anything for you . . everyone knew that you had this <unk> genius , that has helped you .
if your work is <unk> -- not completely your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew , your genius was a little bit .
so , people really have the west for creativity for creativity .
and then the renaissance came and and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s go to the human individual in the center of the universe -- -- about all the gods and mysteries and the , and the <unk> of of divine creatures .
it &apos;s the beginning of the rational gin and people started to believe that creativity had completely from from your own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people to this or or a genius -- -- instead of it it &apos;s a genius .
i have to tell you , i think this was a big mistake .
you know ? i think , a &apos;s is allow that he thinks he thinks or it &apos;s like the <unk> , the the , the the the of all the the , of the , , , , , a little bit too much responsibility to a a lot of responsibility to a a lot of responsibility to a a lot of
it &apos;s like to ask to try to eat the sun .
the cancer and and all of whole , and it &apos;s all these these expectations expectations of success .
i think that this <unk> that this <unk> of the last 500 years of the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is &apos;s the question .
can we change it ?
maybe a ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just have rational <unk> of of 500 years of , not just <unk> in a <unk> talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience , really really really <unk> really <unk> about the idea of the idea of -- basically -- -- -- <unk> , people people and and on their projects .
i &apos;m probably not going to be able to take you on this journey .
but the question i i is is is : why not ?
why not think that that ?
because it &apos;s much much much of sense of everything else that i heard heard about when it was about , the absolutely crazy <unk> of the creative process of the process .
a process that -- -- like anyone knows that ever tried to do something -- in other words -- actually , in in other words , no , is not always everything .
in fact , he can really feel <unk> .
i had a encounter that an encounter , i met stone american poet poet <unk> stone who &apos;s now over 90 , but she was to me , she told me that she was a in the the the the the the landscape , she said she would feel like a you and hear she said , and she said , &quot; you can feel like a you can feel like you and
she she said it would be like a <unk> train out of air .
the the country would be on it .
she felt when it came , because it would take the earth under their feet .
she knew that could do one in a moment of a , and that was -- in her -- -- -- -- <unk> race -- like the devil <unk> .
they ran like the devil house as her , and it was the image , it was the only that you had to get enough enough to a sheet and you can get it , it it through through it , and capture it through it , and capture it off . it .
in other others , she didn &apos;t get enough fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t come the the , she she she she her and she she her , she she she her , and she she said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot;
and then there was these moments -- the part , i never forget -- she said that there were moments in which they did it .
so , she runs to the house , and after after after paper paper and the poem goes through through it and it it it down , you &apos;re a pen by <unk> it and and -- she said -- she was like it was as as to do it .
she caught the poem in his tail , and it moved back into her body and and took it on the sheet .
and these those opportunities that <unk> <unk> , intact , on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word the the .
when i was that i heard this , i was really <unk> -- this is just how my creative process is is like .
this is not at all of my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel .
i &apos;m a <unk> . . to work work to work on every day , and and , and <unk> , <unk> me and really uncomfortable uncomfortable .
but even i i in my <unk> , sometimes this thing .
and i guess that many of you have done that too .
and i had work , or , or ideas that from a source of me , i can &apos;t identify to .
what &apos;s that thing for a thing ?
and how do we enter to relationship with this without our minds , but we even to the even at the at poor mental health ?
for me , the best living is is the the way that can can can the the musicians , i i got to interview it a a few years ago .
we talked about this subject . and you know what ? the most of his life was tom , the embodiment of the <unk> artist who was trying to get these <unk> creative impulses that lived in to to and to them .
but then he got older and my , and he told me that he one one a <unk> in a <unk> , and and there changed everything for him .
he was at high high speed when he suddenly a a little bit of a melody , which is it &apos;s often hard for making it it &apos;s kind of hard . it &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s <unk> . he
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper ; he has no pen , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
so , he starts to to up this old <unk> of up to him , like , i &apos;m going to lose this thing and will lose this this this song , and i &apos;m going to go to forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
but instead of getting out , it just listened to .
he ended all the train and and did something completely new .
he just looked in the sky and said , &quot; sorry , you can &apos;t see that i &apos;m going car ? ?
<unk> , i look at this as i could do a song ?
if you really want exist on , come to a second , , when i can take you .
if not , , <unk> , somebody else today .
go and <unk> leonard cohen .
his whole <unk> has changed .
not the work itself . it was still been dark dark as as ever ever .
but the <unk> <unk> , and the heavy <unk> that , , he was like , it &apos;s , it &apos;s , it &apos;s , it &apos;s , and it &apos;s , he he &apos;s , he he had a <unk> , he realized that it had to be a <unk> , .
it could be a <unk> , , , , , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , , , , , not was tom tom .
and i &apos;ve heard this story , it also a little bit of how i worked and and it was already .
and this this idea saved me by the middle of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , love <unk> , love , and i fell in one of these <unk> of the , we all all , if we &apos;re going to work , and it &apos;s going to be a that &apos;s the worst book , that &apos;s the the book .
not only bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just just the project .
but then i remembered as tom as as i was speaking to the the sky and i tried to .
so i raised my view of the manuscript , and i was to my comment on a a a of of space .
i spoke to the <unk> , , you , you know , you know , if you &apos;re both , if this book doesn not brilliant , that &apos;s not completely to to you , right ?
because you see , i &apos;m all i &apos;ve , i i &apos;m going to . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you &apos;ve got to show up and you &apos;re going to <unk> the deal .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that ... you know what , then the hell .
i &apos;m still write , because this is my job .
and i want to to to record that , i i was for my part of the jobs here .
because ... ... at the end , it &apos;s , , centuries , centuries ago , in <unk> <unk> to <unk> people to <unk> and and and and music that were for hours for hours -- up to to , .
these strong , , the was very , because the dancers were professional , and they were fantastic .
but back , and , very rarely , , special , one of the actors were actually been <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen in in your life in a time .
it was as time , <unk> , and the dancers of a kind of <unk> , he did nothing else else he has done done -- 1,000 nights ago , but everything added together .
and all of a sudden he seemed seemed longer to human .
it was <unk> up by inside the below and and and and and <unk> <unk> fire .
and then happened was happened at that happened , people knew what this was . they called it his name .
they put the hands together and started sing sing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
now interesting historical <unk> : when the <unk> <unk> came into into into the , , they the <unk> , they had the the centuries of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
if you put a actors in spain , impossible to something : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , , , , , it &apos;s a <unk> view .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
but , the tricky part of the next morning , when the dancer alone up and and recognizes that it &apos;s at at tuesday &apos;clock in a tuesday -- and he no longer longer a god god in god .
it &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> knees , and maybe he will never going to up to up to this up on this . .
and maybe someone will will call back , if god &apos;s name , but what do it want to do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most <unk> of of a creative life .
but maybe it &apos;s not not to be so <unk> , if you didn &apos;t believe in the beginning that the extraordinary aspects of their out of you .
if you you you think you &apos;re a from a from a <unk> source of a <unk> source of your life , time , that &apos;s <unk> to anybody else , when they &apos;re done it .
if we start thinking about it , that changes everything .
so i started thinking thinking and think , in the past few of , , i was working on the book , and it &apos;s soon as the dangerous , frightening , <unk> , to to to to to very much for my <unk> success .
what i need to tell myself is if i &apos;m crazy crazy , it &apos;s not a .
don &apos;t <unk> .
just your your job .
be to be in your contribution , whatever it may be .
if your job is dance , dance dance .
if the dumb self of genius is genius , is to to to to the side , to a a a a by by by by your effort , then <unk> <unk> !
and if not , dance dance , dance .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for all of all .
i believe that , i feel like , we should teach teach .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for for all of all , just that you just leave the human love and the the to be to .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i showed these two slides , to illustrate that the arctic arctic arctic that that the for nearly three million years , the she had in the lower states , to 40 percent . .
but this doesn &apos;t <unk> enough of the big of this special problem , because it &apos;s not the thick of ice ice .
in a sense , the arctic is the the <unk> of the the heart of our global <unk> .
it &apos;s growing in the winter and and the in the .
the next slide i show show you is a <unk> of what happened in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is <unk> is red . red .
as you can see , it &apos;s the the <unk> , , this is the annual ice in winter ; and it &apos;s just in in summer .
what so-called <unk> , , five years old , or older , almost almost like blood , which is out of the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone from here here .
this is a problem because warming warming the the near the arctic ocean , which is great amounts of carbon dioxide , which if he &apos;s <unk> , to use microbes from microbes to the microbes .
compared to the entire amount of <unk> materials in the atmosphere , it could double this amount when we cross that critical point .
now , in some <unk> in in a <unk> island of alaska from from the water .
professor <unk> walter walter , in , with a a with another other flat seas in the winter .
wow !
you &apos;re good . the question is , how will it going to be .
and one reason is , this this <unk> is up up through the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume are far larger than than ever .
this is the <unk> river in into into into into into .
if you want to know how to grow up by by by <unk> , , they &apos;re into the ocean .
these rivers are getting a very .
at the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest <unk> on on the planet .
last month , researcher , the whole continent has a negative negative . .
and the <unk> that had a few <unk> to a is particularly strong in melt .
this is to 20 feet feet , , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , , you see new lakes that were few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world have half of the <unk> of this <unk> .
in the <unk> , this glaciers the the of city .
the <unk> have been <unk> .
but if you <unk> , , it will also most most most of the water .
in california , a 40 percent reduction reduction in sierra sierra is .
this is the the .
and the predictions how you read it , are serious .
these <unk> <unk> in the world has a dramatic increase in fire .
and the disasters in the world have has been in a really <unk> and and never unprecedented extent .
four times the last 30 years , like in the <unk> <unk>
this is a totally <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it &apos;s .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve been 70 million tons of co2 by the 24 hours -- 25 million tons of every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific , , american american and and and the indian <unk> , , where there &apos;s a a dramatic decline of oxygen inside the ocean .
the biggest single factor for global warming , next to deforestation , which is 20 percent is the burning fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most dramatic issue .
the united states are one of the largest largest <unk> <unk> , together together . china .
and the suggestion was to build many more <unk> .
but we start to see change .
here are the ones that were taken from the last last years with some green alternatives that were proposed .
<unk> is a political argument in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a <unk> dollars on last <unk> to to clean coal to the , which is already a conflict .
this painting felt me something .
around christmas , , at in in tennessee , a billion tons of <unk> .
they &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is in our country country country country of america &apos;s <unk> .
this happened around christmas .
one of the ads of the <unk> of the was was this .
<unk> is a <unk> , , happy kid .
it &apos;s in the and and and it &apos;s our our economy .
<unk> , the <unk> will clean clean every day .
it &apos;s affordable and <unk> and and , and and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> .
so let me say a a clear . al gore , nancy <unk> , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , you don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the the alliance for protection about about about .
this is one , one of you .
in the <unk> , we &apos;re talking climate change a serious threat for our business .
so we we put it to the supreme <unk> <unk> to to a a <unk> of to to the the to the truth about the truth .
the fact is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s even even fine .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
leave it quiet .
<unk> coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean <unk> .
and yet , the of of the of of the global warming is the the remarkable clean <unk> that you see here , everything everything .
look at it , this is the today , , clean clean . .
finally , the positive process of the the other , our our economic challenge , our our challenge of the national security .
america is in crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that everybody connects all together is our dependence on the fuel of the tall and of oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to make us able to get this this this <unk> of this .
<unk> america is 100 percent clean electricity in the next 10 years .
a plan to get america back to work , make us safer and help to stop global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america new . find more . .
this is the last .
it &apos;s a <unk> of of america .
one of the fastest ways , our our , dirty fuels that <unk> our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investment to create making well for making jobs .
<unk> america new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quickly , go alone .
if you want to come to go . . &quot;
we need to come far , and it &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i want to start by asking you to time time time time time time , when they were playing with <unk> .
as you saw , how to reach out out of the and <unk> , the <unk> , and , and actually , , actually learned to think about and and problems and to solve the change and change change .
the spatial thinking is closely to to understand how we understand most of our environment .
as a scientist scientist -- inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- together with my <unk> <unk> and my colleagues <unk> , and i started to wonder , what if we would use computers , what if we could use the , and the data , and , and we can do it how to do it , and if we can do it and make it as much if we could use it and make it as much if we
this question was so emotional that we we to the the answer to the answer to the answer .
in short short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can move to hand hand , you can see each other , they can them them them and they can have a and and a a .
more importantly , physically , why you &apos;re why you &apos;re just able to reach out of the and access .
and the <unk> is an example of a new generation of <unk> digital digital digital digital digital digital digital data .
and if these are are physical physical and create awareness of their movements , to each other and the the of of our <unk> with them , we can can with with exploration of new and and .
i &apos;ll start with a few examples .
this <unk> is is <unk> for the <unk> , and when i put it in a direction , the video is going forward , the video , when i pay it back to the other direction , it &apos;s backwards .
and these interactive portraits are true .
so if i put them together side side , you you to to .
if you &apos;re surrounded by the , you &apos;ll notice that and you &apos;ll be something nervous .
and she feel feel your movements and and .
so an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to recognize , we we we have a common gestures in data , as as as to as as as as it does it with that
in this case , we &apos;ve three <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to put paint color in the middle , where they &apos;ll be together .
if we keep it , we can a little bit of <unk> .
there are also some some some some some of the own , languages , languages , or <unk> , where we give people to the the of of fast error and and the results immediately .
here i am here -- this is a fibonacci that i &apos;m using a very simple <unk> . .
this is a game with words that a a of a of of <unk> and <unk> .
basically , you get every every single <unk> to <unk> every single , and and you try to to do words , they &apos;re a a a a .
then after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s more mixed again and you &apos;ve got a new new and new ways .
thank you .
these are some of kids who come on a place to be a to to to get them to try and try and put a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting thing about this kind of is is that you don &apos;t have to give people people to instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; well , &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s some people people people that test it .
this is our recent <unk> to down there on the bottom .
it turns out that he wanted to stack up up .
so for him , they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> system for <unk> .
that &apos;s <unk> .
he can put new characters in the scene by put the the the the the the table of the the the .
here he &apos;s the the sun .
the sun goes on on .
now he he a a a .
the orange angel .
good work ! yes !
by <unk> the <unk> shake and and it can put them together , and can can interact with the characters .
... his own history .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open end , and it can decide how to .
flying flying .
the last example i i have time time now is to show it is a <unk> of <unk> that we evolved and and in the as as as as as <unk> , <unk> and and and <unk> .
every has four different variations on ; you can choose to choose what you want to use .
and you can can the notes into the sequence that you can can again in any pattern .
and you &apos;re you you by just by a a <unk> a <unk> .
there are effects that you can live live , like hall and filters .
you connect it with a certain tone and it tends to be it .
and then <unk> of like pace and volume volume that you &apos;re on the the whole sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we start where we start the the the in in two <unk> <unk> and and in a a number , you extend and a little bit more of the voice .
now i add a a .
now i &apos;m going to do a little paper on .
and now i just going the the the the the and to live live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence , by the speed up the one or another other direction .
and now i just going to divide the filter with the , , for a bit more expression .
i can change the sequence as it &apos;s it .
and i don &apos;t need to plan it on the , , but can improvise ; they them to , or more <unk> .
and finally , i can use the whole sequence , by running the the .
thank you .
so as you can see , my excited is to develop new <unk> of , which better to to the how our brains work and bodies .
and today i had time to show you a part of this new <unk> and and some of the ways that we work in our lab .
the idea that i want to to to with you is that we &apos;re on the the at this new generation of <unk> to interaction with the digital media , to the information that the information into our world .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to see with you all .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;m excited i &apos;m &apos;m &apos;m here .
yeah , so what should you be ? ?
i have to step back and step back , and the modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been for a few years now with the <unk> , and i started started because i just wanted to know , and it was to even even what i was doing in the school .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter of matter , so .
i think that in in in general , now , , , , , , , , everything that you count , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important is now extremely important , now , far , far more important will be more important in the future .
there &apos;s been so <unk> things like these things that were made to the plants .
now now craig venter in the <unk> , which is trying to make <unk> , so so out of algae .
now there &apos;s also things that are in the in the life , what people are &apos;t actually , for , for example , for example , <unk> that allow us to wash the to laundry , are also genetically genetically <unk> .
and the list can go on on and on .
and so in the interest in this this technology , i &apos;m going to go on to the .
so why are ? ?
most most most most people know know this from the <unk> .
the computers , , and then it &apos;s always be in the media , yes , the hackers break somewhere somewhere and and data and and and and so on .
and that &apos;s a very of for the <unk> , , because that &apos;s not what it actually actually what it actually actually wrong and what &apos;s actually behind .
and , the the <unk> , , the &apos; 70s , <unk> with <unk> and and it &apos;s also the the the the .
and it &apos;s about a play with a play , creative , , as a problem , a problem .
and problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can just be a <unk> , which simplify how things simplify , so you can do a question , , , how how do you do it better , how how do you do it better .
and it &apos;s been to to the software , but there &apos;s also in the <unk> , , there &apos;s also a whole <unk> that that are doing all kinds of <unk> things .
and now , in in biology , and i want to take this metaphor that comes out of synthetic synthetic biology , you know , biology is actually a a , because , because the &apos;s a more , because it &apos;s a more , because it &apos;s a more , because it &apos;s a real , because it &apos;s a real , because it &apos;s a real
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also code and and you can also be , , , and that , and that found that i found incredibly fascinating , and i wanted to do it a lot of , and i wanted to get a lot more deeper with it .
it actually really , really , , , , , , these these networks .
there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , which is originally , which is with europe and with cooperation in india , but a new in india , but africa has a members of people all over the world .
that &apos;s &apos;s a more artistic direction , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and philosophers and in working with scientists scientists scientists , to and and and and and and and , and , and , and , and it &apos;s all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s actually always about to to such a such a <unk> access to have a <unk> of so that they &apos;re so .
and then there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
this is from the <unk> network , which is actually more such a kind of forum where where where you &apos;re to and and and online .
they &apos;re a little more technical and also a little bit of the way , then , , , , , .
and from these networks that made the whole popular thing , have evolved a that that i want to to a a .
here in the the left is you see <unk> , , this is a <unk> , , so basically a a school , a private school , a private school , , where everyone can be .
children , old , old , all kinds of people go to , and through through it , you , you &apos;re put in lab lab and see what you can do when these <unk> <unk> .
here &apos;s a group in the bottom is a group in indonesia , which is , but it &apos;s a long time .
well longer than these other two networks .
and the are also in as an artistic aspect of biological materials , and , yes , and , and , and they &apos;re actually kind of <unk> .
and a group of from from that i &apos;ve ever met before a while , which is a <unk> that &apos;s a to to to the to the public to what they learn in school , and they made to to the <unk> and and to try to explain what &apos;s <unk> .
and i have up in the other slide in the other at the other in copenhagen in talk in the medical museum in a a exhibition .
and that is , yes , that &apos;s most of the young people , but the only thing that what what &apos;s actually all all united , is this fascination with this .
and what you can do with it , and also actually target the society society and ask , , , , okay , what you you to to , what you want to do you to do you ?
so , <unk> , to <unk> now , , you need kind of material .
you need course , of biological materials , and you need tools , and also , and that &apos;s a lab .
or , what you can do quickly , in a lab , which is kind of <unk> machines , <unk> , expensive , extremely , , , , , , , academic , , and and so on .
and our approach was to say , say , , , you you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because every every every every every has has been more evolved more more technology than most of the , that &apos;s really like .
and now with this premise with this premise , this premise , example brian <unk> in trying to try a <unk> <unk> , , a <unk> <unk> , , and , and , , , and , and , and it , and it it works .
so everyone , one one has a soup that is that it &apos;s too long , too long .
i i just trying to go back to my lab , and i just go to and and then bought out of any <unk> on ebay and and a a bit of analysis , trying to do a a , , , so , just <unk> home .
it &apos;s not really not a joke , but it &apos;s not .
here &apos;s a picture here in the picture here is the lab , in <unk> , so , is such a <unk> garage with so that , all kinds of <unk> that has a group in paris , which is what &apos;s doing is a very quite interesting things , and i really want to do pretty interesting stuff , and i &apos;m going to do pretty quite interesting stuff , and i &apos;m going to do pretty
and this is <unk> , , who also mentioned <unk> , , this , , this , such a kind of <unk> in basically for molecular biology .
and yes , you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively <unk> , so that &apos;s &apos;s a of people who are their to their own , to the big , to big organizations , which are also the more <unk> in in the form .
but always the the approach that it &apos;s just to be it and it &apos;s be accessible to be .
the first project that we &apos;ve done as a international group , when we were aware of our self , <unk> , , there &apos;s us here as real , and we &apos;re in , and we know know , and we know the people who are always and and and and know , and we know the people who are always and and and .
and then came from the <unk> <unk> of the founder , and said , , we also need to meet , also , also , and then two two events , in london , and , and in the in the <unk> , in the <unk> , in in the <unk> .
and , it was , that , , , yes , who are we , what do we want what do we want to say , what do we want to say ?
and what are our values and what are our our , our our ?
and then we &apos;ve out a <unk> out of a .
this was was quite intuitive , so everybody just just have his wishes , his , his and what it moves , words , it , .
and came came to , i think , a very good code .
and the one is not <unk> it , but that &apos;s , i think , , , you know , , you &apos;re pretty well , people people are right there .
and we even have tried to , that the world world , , , , , but it &apos;s not not that there .
so i think we &apos;re in the the of the , even even further , the the world world .
yeah , what do we do for projects now now ?
a project i did with the <unk> in switzerland , which was that we wanted to make an optical optical <unk> or optical <unk> .
this is when you &apos;re focused a beam , you can put a in in the space , you can capture little particles in the air or in the liquid , and then in this focus , so that &apos;s what &apos;s like like a like a <unk> of like a <unk> .
this works really works in the academic <unk> , , and we thought , , <unk> , we might be , , we may have a , , the the , the the lens , , , , , , you , you , a microscope , <unk> .
this is what you see .
and then we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> and and the laser laser and and then it &apos;s trying to focus on this camera .
and that didn &apos;t work out , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of things .
so another project that from from from the french group of paris , which has work , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and it &apos;s a , , , one , such a <unk> , so such a <unk> , so , so , he &apos;s busy <unk> , his <unk> his his <unk> is sam <unk> .
and he was set up this this helmet and and it was cooperation with the museum museum .
then there were the to go in the in in the in the in this chair , put these these helmet .
then their brain measured their brain , and depending on what they thought thought or they they were , , are all the different lights in the room .
a pretty pretty <unk> project .
another thing thing about the united states that also has to do with this <unk> of this , is the the <unk> , , this is the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying , now genes , to grow , , grow fragments , to engage them to make it .
so if i do this this the the the the scene crime , there , then there &apos;s any <unk> , , and then they do these , then then they can say that way , and then you can say , , , this hair , this hair .
and the machines that do this this , are quite expensive expensive that are quite expensive that you could get commercial , the the to go out so .
and that &apos;s not in the <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also a lot .
so this is just an application of many of you can do it .
and they have two two two two two two <unk> <unk> and said , <unk> , that we make make make and cheaper and cheaper , and then it &apos;s source , so they &apos;re , and , and this this is the the of of these these are are now .
i think it &apos;s so six hundred dollars or something .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s not cheap , but it &apos;s in a frame where it &apos;s been clear .
so i think it &apos;s a very <unk> hack .
a project i started recently started building a <unk> .
<unk> is , , like like kind of <unk> , , , the , , , two or two or or way .
you <unk> <unk> <unk> and and the the <unk> into these <unk> , and then i put it on to and and i have them up to the , then then that then .
so the device you see that you can &apos;t work .
but this is so my prototype that which is quite quite <unk> , but it was a a a branch that this thing , put on on this , and put put on the , and it was to , and that was the pressure , but it was the
and then i took a <unk> , and i put it in it .
a <unk> , if you get the full of water with the , , so i think so , so i think , 40 to a bar .
and so , you can go to the particles , and then they go into the .
and the commercial commercial has costs about <unk> euros or something like this , <unk> .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s it &apos;s it &apos;s it &apos;s
so , this is the moment moment , the the the the the the scene , increase this availability of technology , and also the information and the to to to more , that more people can get them .
because , as the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have have different of of of it , and even even to form a chance to make yourself .
because if you read about it , from <unk> , , this is not the same thing as if you &apos;ve seen it himself .
and i think , technology will always important in our modern societies .
and if you want to be a more meaningful choices in the trouble in society , and can make a difference in society , and you need to have to have access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it , and you understand understand it and understand it .
and then the <unk> the open open and the and and citizen science .
so you you you &apos;re being <unk> to the scientific of through this .
and this is the <unk> of from the <unk> .
these are the people who at least officially at the website , <unk> website .
this is already a relatively remarkable number of people world .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re also in southeast asia .
that &apos;s i think that &apos;s there are less people put in people than actually exist .
so i know some of who don &apos;t have .
and these are just the <unk> , , the individual people .
in also , with these <unk> , , that &apos;s put in there .
and this is the beginning .
as i said , , it &apos;s only .
and <unk> , , the <unk> , , because the the the was the first , the first , <unk> .
and this is now a a gigantic network of very good , yes , <unk> that are the the the world .
and we hope , of course , we &apos;ll save more , and then , so much much , so much , so much more people can be involved involved .
and i would invite every once to keep it and and what what try try .
now , it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not impossible if you have enough enough curiosity , and enough energy , you get there .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hi .
how do we work people ?
this is a question that &apos;s a lot of <unk> , but also , but in the in the the in the <unk> , and in the in the in the user .
and it &apos;s about how to walk into interactive media , so they can use these interactive media and they can make it a a very a way of the experience .
because i think that the interactive media is in us , cognitive models , so that paradigm that that in our biological memory , very , very long time , and that we can have been <unk> through interactive media .
and this is very amazing because because you believe believe that these <unk> that you see that you &apos;ve in the the future , but actually it &apos;s actually that the future is exactly the the future is , in our <unk> roots .
now , what are actually models ?
i &apos;ve been to down to four and and i &apos;d like to explain to a little bit quickly .
and the cognitive models models , and that &apos;s the models that we have have us in the call us .
and that &apos;s that that that we &apos;ve that we &apos;ve had a natural natural . .
now , it &apos;s basically an for one .
but i &apos;m going to go into this , and i &apos;ll going to you you to you you , you you you have a natural relationship between . .
the second thing is that we &apos;re absolutely been for because of these <unk> models , are very able to speak very , very , , even though we &apos;re using a <unk> language language .
and the third area , which explains is actually by itself .
we know all of the that the media media has been definition by definition , which is the denial of the human , and what of course tells us that we &apos;re the intellectual today .
the fourth point is that the story is a place of the <unk> .
now , what about about that is that the most most thing thing the world &apos;s the .
i want to to you to prove this .
how many doors got the house that they live ?
and we won &apos;t going to to answer that , , but it &apos;s going to happen , but it &apos;s going to happen in the moment .
they go through the spirit through the spirit , in <unk> , , and , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
they &apos;re the reality , and it &apos;s a computer .
fantastic fantastic , right ?
and then , at the the , for for , for , to show the virtual reality in our <unk> , , we can actually the whole time .
and this is that wealth that the virtual to reality is to the the , the people have had to have the in the times , , because they had nothing .
they didn &apos;t have books books .
or not not a a <unk> .
they didn &apos;t have mass .
the only thing that had had her head .
and in that mind was playing memory .
in this head , <unk> and and and using these virtual images , the imagination , recorded as well as well .
and so it &apos;s also so much in us that we can deal with pisa .
the interesting thing about it is if i can make a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s .
the the interesting thing about this is that time , the time , <unk> and and medium was .
now , you you think of a bit of you .
what are the ?
then you &apos;ll notice that it &apos;s given change .
but i &apos;ll going to talk about the .
the is the world &apos;s biggest tool has been always stories .
<unk> , priests , <unk> , <unk> , they were to to to to to all know stories .
and we &apos;re still going to be very , very , very .
the author of the book , the <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , we still still <unk> across hours of hours with the <unk> of stories .
this means for a child that that to achieve that the most of the most of his life life is most of his life .
now we think of our love to stories depends on that we sat as a kid on our parents .
no , no , it &apos;s missing missing .
it &apos;s a lot of back to the , in the <unk> times .
but for me , in the area of interactive media as particularly amazing , that we we have to in our in our biological memory , the ability to think about .
i brought you back of the of the north american <unk> .
and the lived in the <unk> of of british columbia .
and as you can see , it &apos;s a very <unk> area , and you had to be able to navigate from island to island to get food .
and they &apos;ve done this with what &apos;s called <unk> .
you may know , if you &apos;re a little bit about it , by the australian <unk> .
they have similar principles .
they have no <unk> , , but they have the <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
and what what interesting interesting about this is that the navigation and the the of of the have been photographed . songs .
the that the language of <unk> was <unk> .
that means you &apos;re <unk> sound and and on rhythm .
and these sounds and these rhythm , the geology , the the of of region , and that also course , that could be able to use this songs and and and to the left , and to back to the , and again , again to the to the
why are we not sing to come from from up to a b from up to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s happened happening ?
it &apos;s what &apos;s happening is the machine machine .
we &apos;ve been around before called <unk> .
it &apos;s the age machine , is the the , and is the is the the book is the .
and that &apos;s what happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories and which is our of of their their experiences , in external media .
on the book and and the image .
so , we have god &apos;s a piece of <unk> <unk> .
bma has become alien to to from us , and with reality ,
bruce brown , a famous <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> , , that &apos;s been that these mass mass , he says the book , and the image , so , the internet , so on , and so on , that we have have have our memories and and that have have our have our memories of our memories and
let &apos;s make a little little <unk> .
the the age of the age .
what &apos;s creation our our thinking and our our our ?
then , the are are are are the are the .
and they are been over the centuries , the the of the <unk> of the <unk> .
that means , instead of having to to to , we have a , , , , in masses of of of memories that we can build our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more themselves .
we have a abstract abstract language .
we &apos;re not looking at the in these days longer things things that are not longer in images , but we &apos;re them our language .
we &apos;ve used to that things linear .
and we have the moore as law and there are only exceptions exceptions , like like the the .
what remained remained is the is the <unk> .
still , we &apos;re still very , very , very , very
the question is , what &apos;s now ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had the age age , and we are now now called called the <unk> .
it sounds very <unk> , and it sounds like like science fiction like , i know .
but these concepts of the <unk> that that us these possibilities to find ourselves back back to our skills .
there &apos;s about polymers ; it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to explain this a little bit a little bit .
now , there are technical concepts like like , the reality reality reality is called the distributed reality .
so if you look at google google , , you , you know , a concept is such a concept that what the world world is to to the world is to be the to the the virtual , to a thing , is to to natural , , is going to .
another example is what is called the virtual reality .
so , of course , as as as as , , , we &apos;re moved to physically into not , virtual worlds , very , to the model of the model .
and other other example are the <unk> , smart systems .
these are are spaces that can react to a human beings .
all of all needs the ability to make our sense to to between between than a .
i i in the and i hope hope that video works , a very , very , very beautiful project , brought brought back from michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the two are are are here today .
maybe you can get up to you , so you can go to the two about the two .
and this project project i brought brought again , like , again , how again , this <unk> , cognitive models .
all whole thing is a game , i need to say .
now , of course , the <unk> of <unk> , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and if i say playing computer games , you you have very much eyes , you people people people people people of <unk> or or or they play with with any <unk> in the hand .
anyway , it &apos;s they &apos;re doing it .
this is a game for out .
and that is what i thought i was the the world , i i discover the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data the data that we produce , which we produce the real world .
i apologize sorry i have to be so heavy .
you can do that a lot better better , because there &apos;s more more of it .
and it &apos;s about that i discover a city of a city , i look at what places places or negative .
and so i get to the city of a a different picture , and a different impression , i see seeing negative negative and positive zones of a city and and i get to this way , a very different virtual landscape of a very real .
and we can now to watch here now .
ah , what you can see here , there &apos;s a little explanation of what you see in the same .
of course , this virtual world in the walls walls , is , is clear .
and with a kind of a flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds .
so , i &apos;d love to love this up my my my talk and in the sense that the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve been acquired from the <unk> <unk> , and that we &apos;ve been a a of <unk> , , in the machine , , , and , in the future , , , , , and , and , and , and , and , and , and , and , and , and
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very to be very to be able to be .
i &apos;ve been asked asked whether this is a bag of a bag is a a bag and and i &apos;ll talk .
that &apos;s not going to do it .
i &apos;m also able to work in the same thing .
but i &apos;m not going to do it it .
yeah , children are be curious , curious , be curious , be curious , designers .
i &apos;m a designer &apos;s , so i &apos;m in the of of course , and the the of the curiosity and how how you think and why we think , and why we lose curiosity and and , and , and , and , and , and so on .
this is a whole range of things that you are about to to the in a <unk> .
if professors will curious , they &apos;re going to <unk> in this .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last year .
a <unk> of natural user is natural .
now , you &apos;re going to ask why all of the <unk> of of the of natural <unk> , <unk> communication , communication , communication , and and and so on .
and i just think one of these little devices , , because the things are always more intuitive more more , always more , natural , , and , and you have to look at what &apos;s actually , of , , what &apos;s <unk> , , or what &apos;s <unk> or intuitive .
and before the background , i have natural natural interface in the , , the next generation in the , in the the computer is in the human computer in the to show computers , how the the computers , or the computers , how the computers are the computer , or the computers are changing the computer .
so i started busy when what &apos;s of course , or intuitive .
perhaps , again , again , again .
why is that happening ?
so if we look at our society , we look at this , , , , , we &apos;re moving to the third in the fourth <unk> or <unk> .
so from the modern modern <unk> .
every society is shaped by a <unk> . .
the the the the the the the .
that means you found found , you &apos;ve been a a language language , you could communicate with each other , to the the in the the , , cities , cities cities , cities , and it &apos;s <unk> .
the the <unk> was the language , something very natural , something very natural .
you , you , you , you can &apos;t be a , of nature , but we &apos;re learning to do it , and , of course .
this is the way then the way by the the and the the first form of abstraction .
and that was a <unk> , because , of course , because of course , the the in the in the in the form of writing , which is what <unk> and and , i start , and it it it and and it it .
depending on the , i i <unk> and when i <unk> , , of course , it &apos;s a different of coverage , if there &apos;s a a of of , , .
but then , in the , , this as a <unk> , , , .
then the next generation that we we actually live today .
this is just through pressure and <unk> <unk> script and <unk> writing and others .
at that time , it &apos;s a <unk> , where the <unk> , <unk> and other other , are you are , you &apos;re actually , when people people want to to , , the afterwards , and that &apos;s the other , , and that &apos;s is the .
and now we come to the next generation and the exciting , is just a a a few hundred years , and we &apos;re really in in this in this this this this in this this this , that we that we get .
and that , , , , , because we &apos;re looking at one hand , the new media , media media , media media , media media , and so on .
so , total transparency , what what the new think think about the the , , don &apos;t say that in the <unk> <unk> and no more is more or other phenomena , which is i want to to <unk> that , and , and want to to that .
and these two worlds just just together , new and and old .
and the exciting thing is , if you look up , this new society , these <unk> , , very very , very , very kinds of mechanisms and and the paradigm of from the <unk> .
now , not at the local level , but on the global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the subject of ecology is a global .
not if i think of the green and the neighbor thinks less sound , it doesn &apos;t work .
this is , from local village , actually found a global village with the same principles , of course , stories , stories , stories , but also , something something like something total transparency .
as you at the time , in the village , who who who who who , and when , this is what happens to this , of our self , through this mobile network of global <unk> . global .
it it that we have made the global and faster and and and more and .
as it was as the used to the village .
before the background , i was to look at at this , what &apos;s it &apos;s , of course , what is what we have , of course , what we have , , , , well , , well , what makes us make , well , what makes the difference ?
because because often , because , you can &apos;t do it , they can &apos;t do it to so any of any of it .
so you have to deal with it , what does this mean , and not just simply change it , it &apos;s different , it &apos;s it &apos;s it &apos;s be better .
and when course , of course , is something intuitive and how how can i take a and and how to do things things things that are so to be a a , , , as if you &apos;re , , , you &apos;re fun and use it .
you know , , as as a , , , the subject of perception and the .
and that &apos;s of course , what you know , where you start and and and and says , okay , now i just look at inside the inside of the inside .
and what does it look like ?
so how do we work when we do it ?
and what , of course , what , of course , , , how how our channels in perception and how how how how cognitive processing ?
because steve jobs said , you you to <unk> to <unk> to <unk> it it it .
so you really need to look at at the detail , if i want to make something more <unk> or intuitive , , which is what &apos;s &apos;s at the core .
and you you can see that you have a a seven senses , most of think we only have five , , are , you &apos;ve been seven , , because , you &apos;ve come to the next future , the next , , to be , , and , and its material also .
and to how how do we process information how how do we take information ?
what &apos;s to say , , what is information ?
information is a difference that makes difference difference .
many of the use the word , don &apos;t know what it is then .
but i have to understand at the core , in the creature when when will information information , if information will be data information , and from information , again , know , know how to look at things as well as i can tell you how to tell you how to might be some intuitive , or
and of course , how is creation creation . perception .
we see this , if i make things , i can make you <unk> like on the right side , where i don &apos;t know what is salt and pepper , or i can make it new intuitive by by showing things .
so , a lot of natural , , in a vessel , but i see sort of directly , where where is salt and pepper .
and if i say somebody , you give me salt or pepper , , it &apos;s going to be at the right , where it &apos;s what &apos;s inside .
and then , just intuitive intuitive , and then hopefully that that no sugar is in that , the salt you .
but also our perceptions , how how do they feel that .
for example , this perception in context .
the the the the is looks greater than than the little , even though that &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just the same size , and still , our perception , the after what which context of the context .
does anyone know what this is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> should work .
there &apos;s &apos;s going to be on my of my glasses .
so it &apos;s &apos; n .
a second circle is beginning to be to to , or but .
and if i get a <unk> <unk> , , we don &apos;t see more more one more one , , which is circle circle circle circle circle and , but we &apos;re seeing a unit , we &apos;re not going to see three pieces , a circle , a circle , a
this is called called <unk> or or <unk> , that also also the us in in perception .
so , important for the <unk> , which have mostly the first semester , the first semester , the great <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> of the continuity and so on .
so , in the third , again .
but this is an essential essential to if you you to things things that you can also be able to be a .
the next phenomenon , which is very interesting , is seeing this .
sound sound is all simple , but it &apos;s exciting to be you &apos;re getting closer to it .
so we we the eyes and you know , you &apos;re thinking , we &apos;re looking at the back of the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you can see the the back of the back .
and they &apos;re <unk> one assumption in front of the front of you , you see what you can recognize , <unk> circle .
that means we we &apos;re starting to see our we see it , then , again , in the back in our <unk> , to say , okay , okay , ok , ok .
i &apos;ve got that little cognitive <unk> , you have what you want to see .
that &apos;s then , that &apos;s then comes back .
and then it &apos;s back again , because the the back the the back , and , now , look at look at , , , , you , you , whether what you see , is what you want to
and then it goes back back and then it &apos;s actually only .
so a whole , very , process , how certain things things things things things things things things things things happen to happen .
i don &apos;t know who you know about this image .
and &apos;s exactly what &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve said you .
now , everyone tries to recognize this pattern .
i don &apos;t know what what recognizes .
does anybody else something particular ?
a <unk> , , right .
once i saw that that that that that &apos;s a <unk> in , you know .
they will never forget to , because i &apos;ll show you where the is is the .
now you see the <unk> .
and on , now , you see it .
that means , i &apos;ve you now in the world that that not &apos;t recognize any pattern , , but i have it in very short time , again , again , this dog dog in this dog .
and this is this projection of movement , <unk> , , see .
now i know , i now , i i the front of the i see the the .
i see the <unk> . .
so , really exciting processes , in this , yes , , , , , , but , but here in this <unk> mass of the things .
anybody know what three three seconds are ?
long , yeah .
that is our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know , as a designer .
if i know something about three seconds , until i sort of the the present to the the , , i can also bridge a very <unk> bridge that i i in in which i put it in with three seconds .
it has to be it as as a present .
then it goes into the past , and i can bridge that elegant , , for example , the the computer , when i know this phenomenon .
what &apos;s going to milliseconds ?
yeah , milliseconds .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time that you love love with .
that means you may be be you you know , you look at how to look at how long , because i can &apos;t take any <unk> for what you can actually happen to .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the most of of perceptions that we have .
that is , this first impression is happening in fast fast fast fast fast fast .
and how we can see things we look at what we &apos;re looking , and we &apos;re our our our environment , so we can think of our environment .
of course , the are not just about the of perceptions of perceptions and neural <unk> , <unk> , but primarily , of course , the the subject of the .
so , a human with a certain things .
there &apos;s a <unk> of the the practical features so so that &apos;s so <unk> aspects or <unk> aspects .
there are <unk> , where i know where i have to do is to reach .
but there &apos;s also a physical form , why why is a a little <unk> , where where anyway , which is &apos;t <unk> , so <unk> money money , although it &apos;s not so much ?
and we &apos;re more on the <unk> , on the <unk> , , which we are , of course , as as as incredible as yet .
back back to my real , , natural user , , and the topic , which is , of course , is <unk> .
<unk> means , , how can i can a certain certain goal , or how can a be a a a a a a a a particular way , effective and efficient and <unk> and
so &apos;s what the norm is the norm .
how can i make something little bit of a ?
i can i can it directly , or need to <unk> manual , or do i need a more profound training that .
and less <unk> or <unk> or <unk> .
that i &apos;m just making you make a fun of beautiful , that doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that .
and if you &apos;re seeing the software that we saw saw , at this , you you can also understand why you know , , is a little intuitive , or not in a <unk> , , , in a <unk> , , , , even more more , , even more known than a
but this is intuitive by not not only a a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , if i just wanted to to to people &apos;s how to use .
why ?
because in the , we we through this new kind of <unk> , , the natural user , , , for example , times times times on average on our goal .
you have to imagine that if you do something that if you do something the classical <unk> , , five hours , and and with this new kind of natural software that only one of the natural software is only one hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re probably going to go to four hours to go , but your employers or anyone anyone you or someone someone to the four hours to them .
but i want to say that it &apos;s a of of of , of course , is also a a of of things .
if we go into again in the software of the software , this is the first <unk> line of interfaces that were very comfortable , where you took months to deal with these systems .
then the the next that the the that have already have a or a of or mental model like the software <unk> , , , you &apos;ve been able to have a idea of something that &apos;s metaphor metaphor , a a a desktop , to make the the the computer .
so not &apos;t &apos;t see zeros and zeros or <unk> or , but a a metaphor .
so this is what &apos;s all of the way of , but it &apos;s still much better .
the next generation of <unk> works is working a lot more with behavior .
so there &apos;s a lot of a lot of a lot more to a a of behavior than that .
this is also a paradigm shift .
that once that look that look this look like this , <unk> , the success , the <unk> is a application .
and if i take a step into these natural user interfaces , where i , by , , , by , , by <unk> , , , , and no longer mouse and and the the , , i &apos;m still , and and .
and that leads me to again , again , when will things happen when are actually more to be more ?
if you &apos;re more intuitive , and then i have to be my my little little of here and look at , and look at , , what &apos;s the most of the , , , , is , is really something really intuitive ?
and that &apos;s always for us humans is always intuitive if i have to think about it very little bit about it .
so it seems to seem to think he don &apos;t like to think , but it just just do it .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive is more intuitive .
and what does that mean for designers ?
that means if we look at that we can use existing from a different of of another , for example , the metaphor , then , i can use this to a .
that means , i can can just a an intuitive through a new human <unk> human <unk> to software software and to the software to the software .
so , of course , what is the the of of of us , and now , i &apos;ve already telling us .
this is what called the <unk> .
this uses each other and <unk> is an acronym and it &apos;s is the , , , , , , , , , , , .
that &apos;s all of you all all the time , but it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> , , and , , , , , , .
so the model is already <unk> in the womb and the is <unk> , so it works in young and old , and it &apos;s used by by all the time , but the most most of the most of the is that this is .
<unk> <unk> <unk> to about 50 to 40 to the time of us , the , , , in the sleep , you know , it &apos;s less than than than than than the day .
i can now able to do this mental <unk> , , <unk> , , , , , <unk> , <unk> .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the metaphor , now , now , a a metaphor of a physical object , but a a of a <unk> , a <unk> .
and this is on a higher grail of the <unk> than the transmission of the classical , , which is the <unk> of the .
and if i i that , , for example , i i to to as a <unk> , , , , , in the case , it &apos;s big up , i can see it in the , and i can tell you , and , and , and , and , and .
and then i can use it all the .
i &apos;m trying to try this through a <unk> .
now , every least saw saw pies .
the picture now , i interact interact with the object , again , again , <unk> .
i &apos;ll get the whole of of , now can can filter this and say , show me just show me all of you .
and once in a interface , what &apos;s more more unexpected and more natural is a lot natural natural .
because that can reach the things like the piece , <unk> can go and and they come to me , is a natural natural organized on the <unk> organized websites , or some of of understanding of things things that are available to
imagination is more powerful <unk> <unk> <unk> , and with this sentence , i &apos;d like to close close to a a and again , to give you a bit , even need to think to to come to new solutions , and , and i &apos;m you very good attention to your attention and ask .
i want to give you a a specific aspect of curiosity .
the first thing when you become child as a child , baby , is that they care of what what are they do like , , , and the , whether parents have allowed their parents to play more or less in the , , , the more , , , , , , , , , , going to be a <unk> of
and curiosity does not learn .
so , all of those are are are are are curious , in fact , people who are a feature that can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m &apos;m talking about it , it &apos;s all of this whole <unk> , <unk> , 40 years to get into in .
and there &apos;s a central point .
and it depends on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a a chance .
every day , they will give you a , about two gram of phosphorus every every one every day , you have to start two gram of phosphorus .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could only be as <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
if we don &apos;t get phosphorus and and .
and amazingly , it &apos;s that we &apos;re ourselves with something something that would actually be <unk> , , but it &apos;s not that way .
because all of talking about energy , but nobody talks about the <unk> .
the <unk> is a lot more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we just have the phosphorus for two years , now , by the the the the the world &apos;s much more uranium in the world &apos;s environment as in all the the .
in the last 20 years , <unk> tons of uranium on our fields in our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s let &apos;s take it . .
it makes leukemia in kids .
and we think we we would protect the environment , if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , <unk> the environment , gets less car .
<unk> the environment , make less waste .
<unk> the environment , <unk> energy .
this is not an protection .
this is how if i would say , <unk> your child , just just a times than times times .
this is just a little bit less destruction .
if we think about the <unk> to the the , , our whole will be our whole , or even a a .
so , about thinking about the <unk> of the .
and the most important thing is , look at the ground , first thing .
in the ground over percent percent of the <unk> &apos;s stored .
now , we &apos;re going to have corn and between and and 30 30 million capita acres or the the foot of <unk> .
that &apos;s , we lose about five times more five times more than <unk> .
and we can look at the <unk> of of .
and everything is ok , ok , ok .
in <unk> , for example , the <unk> <unk> percent of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and because we &apos;re older , that are <unk> .
that &apos;s they &apos;re all of the <unk> .
yeah ?
a baby &apos;s a a .
we could be that of course , 10 percent , but what do it do ?
this is in in a a in in a second .
that &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we do with these ? ?
so , one of the evidence that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to be the the paper pigs in the .
people people the the urine .
yeah .
so , you can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s it &apos;s it , right ?
traditionally , we think we &apos;re in the <unk> , , we &apos;re too many of the world .
and if you people people that if you &apos;re to to the people that if you say , that would be better , you &apos;re &apos;t even , you &apos;re <unk> and hostile .
and so says says like , like al gore , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing <unk> to stabilize the human population .
in israel , you you &apos;re a an human <unk> , you you the earth .
here &apos;s says , you you , the more you , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too too ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then , the ants would weigh more times more than we people .
i could use termites and use it in the united states , one of , only one , , even far , even though they &apos;re .
that that , ants weigh more than we .
and because they are a lot harder harder than we and because because they &apos;re only three to six months , , you &apos;re in your weight , you &apos;re going to billion billion people in energy energy consumption .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re stupid , yes ?
and where you see how far we are , we really wanted to reach out and and how , and how sad we are , and how sad we are , we can see on the earth , you can see that for example , you can a a program , you , to you ,
you can only be <unk> if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
have you seen a tree tree ?
yeah ?
one ?
that means , our whole intelligence means that we could be <unk> as a trees , yes ?
yeah ?
no &apos;s not a tree .
not , right ?
there &apos;s no <unk> of trees .
there are still six hundred billion trees in the .
do you have heard of of trees from trees ?
that means , all of our intelligence means that we could be a to be a trees .
and where you see , even at something like <unk> , who &apos;s <unk> , which which is not allowed to be our own <unk> .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really have to go back in the economy .
and we we with lots of . .
it alone .
so , we feel feel guilty about the earth we say we say , there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , , and how they all the that allow our own <unk> to go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we we too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful be harmful to be <unk> .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to try to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , it &apos;s the highest , not be there , right ?
<unk> , yeah ?
you can only have <unk> if you &apos;re there .
even if you shoot you now , you would have seen emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can give our nutrients .
we do in agriculture in agriculture where we give the nutrients .
now , we can in this way , and in in agriculture .
we do this in china china , for example , where we take to take the look at the way .
in china , a a <unk> <unk> , , , , , , , right ?
and in our western world , we were too stupid , our nutrients .
this is , the the western <unk> <unk> is all the the city only has only been , but the farmers never ever returned to .
and it had to grow the cities , because the farmers were going to come into cities and the cities had to keep away their nutrients .
and so all the western western &apos;ve been expanding , and they &apos;re not getting the infrastructure , and then they they &apos;re <unk> .
yeah ?
in china , it &apos;s different .
you &apos;ve been <unk> civilization about five thousand thousand years , because you always had to be able to give the nutrients .
even today , if you invited to eat in china , you expect to eat the way that they &apos;re as long as they &apos;re to the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> <unk> , and the nutrients give .
you &apos;ve got them them to eat her , not to the .
that means you can see the the internet , you can can can the nutrients .
and what &apos;s really beautiful about is , if you do that , so agriculture is producing producing , , on a acres of thousand thousand people in the , , in the farmer can make a a of of and and and and and and and and and and and and and fish and fish and
and the great thing about this is that the <unk> in the to the percent of the to percent .
so we don &apos;t need to control people to be very little .
we can support them to be good .
this is of course , , , but the have have the . .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by design design , that &apos;s a farmer can &apos;t .
that &apos;s , so that the the <unk> back .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve now built over <unk> in the last twenty years , no of these plants have ever been . .
you could just be just a <unk> of <unk> <unk> and then it would be be the in this be .
it &apos;s not not .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people to be very good .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to phosphorus phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , in , in , in best of all the treatment in the , in the
unfortunately , unfortunately , not in <unk> , but maybe you can help the the the of a little bit .
because the <unk> facility could be the phosphorus .
and that &apos;s back .
we &apos;re going to see that that is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s well .
we &apos;ve used in holland in the three years .
the dutch government has explains , they will be the first country country in the country .
but we need to have this .
you know , there are two countries that are nearly 70 percent of the world &apos;s <unk> .
there is an a a of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries , the 40 percent of the <unk> control .
and the oil is going to replace them by other energy energy .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace .
that &apos;s not about making the existing a existing a little less bad , but it &apos;s about doing it .
and it &apos;s to to ask , , what is the right thing .
that means it &apos;s efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , you understand that , of , because in holland , the the country is the .
yeah ?
imagine if for example , if your woman is sad , if you you have them , you you &apos;re you &apos;re coming to 50
completely inefficient .
but effectively , right ?
or take a <unk> . .
a woman in germany , six three <unk> three of of lives .
it &apos;s .
this is not not precisely not right because because we don &apos;t know how much more <unk> will going to .
but a <unk> , , even in that lighting , i can tell you , very inefficient , but all effective , right ?
a everything that &apos;s beautiful , is not efficient .
that &apos;s not efficiency efficiency , but efficiency .
ask , what is the right thing ?
not to burn the <unk> a little bit better and and it it to and and in the the the of materials materials , but to the , but , but let &apos;s first
imagine being efficient at mozart .
yeah ?
if i go to the dinner and say , say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with <unk> and and a glass of water .
wonderful , &quot; ?
this is efficient .
all that &apos;s beautiful , is not efficient .
if you fall in love with each love ?
yeah ?
that means everything that matters is it &apos;s not to save to save , to reduce .
the whole <unk> . .
we say the people , oh yeah , you don &apos;t have green in in the south .
no , just throw out is right right thing , right ?
every every place where you can , , , , yes , you can do it again .
but the wrong things .
if you &apos;re the wrong things , you have a <unk> . .
in how we think of north north .
there &apos;s every footprint there .
if you walk , yes , if you take the footprint .
because the the ground will die die of the mosses are dying and the wind and the water is the the
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means that the water that the water will longer in the meadow
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that will be a .
not <unk> .
we say in germany .
yeah ?
but if i ask you , how do you do this with your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , <unk> <unk> , yes ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s right now .
so , not save , avoid , avoid .
everyone waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a simple thing when you see in italy , as people in the the high of of the the <unk> that you
because you know , this is a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a sounds of <unk> , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
we &apos;ve developed a a <unk> example , which is is a in temperature and is now .
they can go to the where they go and stand .
in two hours , it it all over .
and it contains seeds seeds of rare plants so they throw away by throw away biodiversity biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not not harmful harmful .
so it &apos;s two two two pollution .
not all supposed to be <unk> .
a tv or a machine machine that they use use they use they use .
just the things that <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , , that have to be like that they go into biological systems .
the things that are only used , in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about biological systems .
yeah ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
and the not for not , not for the company by <unk> , but they they help this this this businesses to make these products .
because we don &apos;t do the things things .
yeah ?
so , if i go to food and say say , it &apos;s free , <unk> , then you doesn &apos;t help you .
no , we what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like <unk> .
not toxic in .
it &apos;s all in is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can can the the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , , , ?
all of them is <unk> .
and if we can do it , it &apos;s of course , for <unk> , for nike , for <unk> and and and the the textile textile .
and that &apos;s half of all the the worldwide worldwide that are caused by the textile textile .
so , you help them , ask ask for people .
hey , <unk> , do you really really , really really ?
because they &apos;ve been the the the <unk> .
and i &apos;m not sure that it really really .
so , you me a little bit of this .
but it &apos;s .
yeah .
what &apos;s just been shown .
that &apos;s going .
we can do things now that that if you if you <unk> if you <unk> , you can go into biological numbers .
china &apos;s the art .
there &apos;s a direct direct <unk> .
this is the first ecological backpack , actually , which is made to go back to the cycle .
so , in any store , you can get things .
if you come to that , yeah ?
do you remember the <unk> that the ?
if you &apos;re the the .
these are <unk> around , , these <unk> .
in the where people come come from money .
you go on the <unk> , but too , in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastics , so that can go into biological systems , if we change the <unk> , , , , you can go back to <unk> , , you can go to a baby in israel or in in the <unk> in miles in in miles .
yeah ?
when you take these <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , and they and the powder to to plants .
so is the baby &apos;s for the whole life , already from the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s sort of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yeah , so , you .
yeah ?
we can do that .
we can invent everything .
i &apos;ve created a research center .
now now now , a lot of people people and they can get them .
there &apos;s extra times a group , <unk> where everyone can .
so no more save , avoid , avoid avoid , reduce , not , , , , but intelligent waste .
does you sell that curious ?
thank you .
the work of the work .
music language language .
in the description of my speech , wrote that i as a <unk> , , as a <unk> , , , as i &apos;m in english , , .
<unk> &apos;s without from the <unk> of music .
that you don &apos;t just word a a word for the text to a text in a different language , but also the deeper sense of the words and <unk> to understand it is a second translation that everybody who knows it with <unk> .
you can to translate into the english , , you can require more able to feel it if it when it &apos;s about poetry poetry or all about poetry .
it &apos;s really strange to <unk> , what we do with our <unk> .
as a <unk> , i i the first first of the first first .
you think that the the in the the notes is everything everything he had imagined .
in fact , the notes are very <unk> and <unk> .
these notes are about exactly the same , or <unk> like a verbal mind , if if you seem very seemingly accurate , , a landscape .
because in this <unk> <unk> , the the of the flowers not &apos;t smell the the of the only one of the <unk> , not to hear the <unk> , not to not to .
that means that the the of the , the the of data to the <unk> to another , which is <unk> , concrete , , concrete .
today i want to to you what i can do to do is otherwise , , , , again , to a language language .
so basically a translation translation of translation .
so i i it to do it , because because if i had to translate it in the because if i had to translate it to english , it would be to me to translation of the translation translation of the translation .
so , the music works for me to like like the language language .
the <unk> notes have the function of the letter of writing .
so it &apos;s not going to be to learn to learn to read and to the the to the the or the the to the the to a a .
and that &apos;s just the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the the the of the letter you can &apos;t do when you can the language .
and so you need to the learning the music of music for the music as as as as for the spoken .
then , there &apos;s <unk> , , if you can it for the <unk> , , only can &apos;t you , , you can also have to the the musical native speaker .
the work of the <unk> starts beginning to the a <unk> .
after you &apos;ve picked a piece of a play , play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you you &apos;re <unk> , you , you , of the of of the composition .
you get information about the the piece of the .
you read in the letters , <unk> , notes , or or , or whether words , thoughts of the composers .
you study the works that he said and and written .
you compare comparing . .
the <unk> , writing it .
how did he felt it ?
how were its circumstances of the , how the society and politics ?
this is all interested in .
you think in in this time by making contemporary pictures or a literature .
but time , you have got an an of an an in an an of the the that you play a more than than it goes a and it &apos;s easier to feel it to go into him and feel .
the composer is going to be more to to to to be living .
his cause to to the piece , is going to be more and more and more and more my personal cause to play it .
now , the notes are everything else as a integrated record of the kind of composers , but a framework , i &apos;m going to take this framework to take again to make it meaning again .
i &apos;m saying to say my my own words , what could be on this framework .
i &apos;m <unk> <unk> what these have to have .
now for me , for the , and for the , and what you could mean today .
every sound , every phrase gets get a sense of this , because i feel it because it because it &apos;s out of my , now , now .
it &apos;s to to me in here and now now , i can &apos;t be my audience , i can &apos;t convince my audience is that that &apos;s my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy happy , , if i can have the experience , that piece that i &apos;ve been so long as long as it new .
how to tell a happy new day , even though , with the same rituals rituals with life , stand up , , , , , , , so i , as as as i have the same piece of the .
i became a day day , , , , my pulse , my my morning , in the morning , it takes longer , that the sound comes back back to the .
i &apos;ll take it to the , , , or <unk> .
all of that , and all of that , and all of this is also the composition .
very wonderful , if i &apos;m with a <unk> on on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then it happens happens in a good , , <unk> conversation .
you &apos;ll make a new idea in and and , will happen to a reaction to a response .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we don &apos;t have , and what you don &apos;t have and whatever you don &apos;t have samples .
it &apos;s great fun to make music , , and they as the audience , then , how the music is communicating .
so every &apos;s just a different concert .
i will never going to play more like this , like that moment .
i can &apos;t play this like like 20 years in 20 years .
there &apos;s more more than than today , and i &apos;ll going to have more <unk> on my skin of my my <unk> , still a lot more <unk> , emotions emotions and emotions as today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have a <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s new <unk> .
i did a nice thing thing .
it was on a <unk> of for my teacher &apos;s teacher , <unk> <unk> <unk> , a famous <unk> , <unk> , and a long professor of <unk> , in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so he had already <unk> when i finally started studying .
but i had the great lucky enough , it very early , with 13 , and to get back to my school , and i was going to school .
i was 17 , when i was on one one of his class back and played the last the of the <unk> by by the .
he asked me what the introduction of this <unk> for me to be .
this is such a <unk> part .
and in my <unk> , i said , expectation .
and he he said , , like , , like that ?
this must be the <unk> .
because for me , me , again .
he was been on 60 .
well , 17 , you have got dreams dreams , but they &apos;re not have a <unk> memories .
i &apos;m going to play this over the years , and it &apos;s gone to me , even though there &apos;s a single grade .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because time , i &apos;ve got to tell something new .
an example from a whole different , , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but it &apos;s different different , , in <unk> light .
he &apos;s translated the <unk> <unk> , translated as he saw it , as they look at it , as it &apos;s like it .
his personal <unk> of the .
the <unk> interpretation of a piece is to to .
and now , i &apos;ve been older as a <unk> by <unk> , when he was the piece .
he &apos;s lived just a years years .
and it &apos;s important to look at the , , even if i mean to it .
to keep <unk> , , directly with the composers .
because the notes are the only link to him .
especially if it &apos;s died .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said yes , you need it for the for the as well as the spoken language .
often the most of the , is that you can learn to read the notes .
you &apos;re basically first read it , you only have a word a word .
you learn to find the notes to find on the instrument .
if you go all all on your time , and right as it &apos;s in the notes , then move the notes , come up to sound like music .
if this &apos;s a <unk> , , the students &apos;s the the the <unk> .
it &apos;s not about about interpretation of the .
all right , there &apos;s a <unk> , , that &apos;s a quick piece .
<unk> , slowly .
according and <unk> , the , f , etc .
that &apos;s most most of here .
but even if you give them them , , it still still technical . .
and still still no interpretation on it .
i wonder .
i wonder wonder , you often feel a little more <unk> to forget .
because , to make music on the instrument , do your musical do , and you can feel about it before .
that &apos;s singing .
a child who didn &apos;t learned that because because it &apos;s not have the parents , not &apos;t have it , not &apos;t do it itself .
this is like the <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have his own experiences and idea of the music to make it about another way , so you can to to sound .
people who never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever immediately , as a own body as it is to make a sound .
and again , a line to design your own breath .
because the instrument instrument is the extension of our body .
our vocal vocal to sing to sing , and your and dancing .
so the the are the the the of my finger .
the melody is out of the <unk> and the rhythm of the .
the <unk> <unk> today is music is not <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to make more to music if it &apos;s going to be .
no longer needed to whistle a <unk> or sing .
each own music is <unk> <unk> when you &apos;re always <unk> from the outside of music .
sure , there are some of you who say say yes , yes , but what do if if i can &apos;t sing ?
so , i , i can &apos;t sing , you can &apos;t sing , because you believe you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they don &apos;t learned to sing ?
in both not to to start to to find out if you can &apos;t , whether you can &apos;t , how to learn how to take these little muscles that <unk> the the vocal box , right .
you can train .
or c , because you &apos;ve got it them that they &apos;re <unk> .
now , i question , how <unk> was was that diagnosis ?
have you already got a <unk> or or <unk> , how to do it beautiful ?
or d , you don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t want to do it .
so what i would then is is because music is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can also <unk> them .
well , you know , , all the cases nobody has to be a <unk> candidate .
but don &apos;t you don &apos;t , i don &apos;t understand anything , i don &apos;t understand the classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
i i say , but sure can you tell whether you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says , i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m tastes because i can &apos;t cooking .
so , they light light not not food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so , you don &apos;t have to light it in classical music because because it doesn &apos;t play an instrument .
listen to and tell you , if you &apos;re tastes or not .
whether the music is too too , or too cute .
tell what you feel .
over time you get you , and you want to be something more like more or more or taste or taste , or taste , or like .
why am i asking myself from my audience , that it &apos;s going to listen ? ?
because the music is a language language and language is a language .
a piece of you you never never to to do .
the food that you have a cook a chef or a chef be be eaten , and not only looked at or like .
so , listen to if you &apos;re played .
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> . .
if in an environment , where the adult adult do music , or at least active music , a child grows up , a child , it &apos;s easily to to a <unk> , ask , which color is your
can you play me in in blue ?
and the child plays , after a <unk> , , a red , a red flower .
and this sounds very different from before .
and that was the first first of the very first expression of a musical expression .
so the first step into one interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece of today that originally originally , in a hundred , or or ago , had written ?
now , the instruments have been <unk> .
there was no time that <unk> today , not a a .
it wasn &apos;t pretty much .
i think that the would have been thrilled when he had the <unk> of the modern modern modern <unk> .
i can can the the <unk> that that the the the the on the modern wing , what a <unk> <unk> can &apos;t &apos;t .
now , by beethoven knows that hey , he had more than , as he had been deaf .
today , a modern modern modern is to play everything , which is a a of the the orchestra .
so , composers depend on us that people that the pieces .
they &apos;re to to them , what they &apos;re in in the spirit .
and also what you would think about today is the spirit .
or what i &apos;m thinking about today because what you might have thought .
thank you .
you know what is envy ?
did you have <unk> of it ?
and how did that felt ?
<unk> .
i have a friend who &apos;s driving a <unk> .
when i come to my little v w w and and i next point , this is this feeling .
i was the through the head .
i say , <unk> , what do you need you do about it ?
this is already recently the the of of the of of his value .
and at all , you work , you , much less than i .
why why i have to do this little little car ?
and then immediately immediately , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice is this awkward feeling .
and organism has invented a wonderful method to do these uncomfortable feelings of like rocks out to disappear .
you can also try to try to , , or or or like .
i want to talk to you today about this mechanism today or something see what you &apos;re &apos;re familiar with you &apos;re a familiar with .
the mechanism comes from lie .
but don &apos;t think of the lie in the lie , you may have heard if people say , people who have a a wall .
and then <unk> , so so he can give them the the view .
and if you look at this lie , the liars don &apos;t believe the liars don &apos;t believe what he says .
it &apos;s a a bit of a that it &apos;s a different different of the sense .
he &apos;s just that it &apos;s not , you .
no , the lie that i talk about that that they things things things things .
you need this lie to get a <unk> to get to <unk> .
they can make less easily , yes , <unk> , <unk> .
you need time .
from this time , one anecdote an anecdote that you may know .
the spanish painter <unk> picasso once a woman woman .
this woman did <unk> , the portrait wouldn &apos;t see see .
picasso says , wait for them .
it &apos;s going to be more similar .
and this point , and when you laugh , you realize how important this lie is how how much time you need to learn something that artist can tell us what artists can well .
because artists have a a relationship to lie lie .
and artists will share you with , and especially of this lady , what she doesn &apos;t see if you look at the mirror .
and artists puts you in one of a portrait of what you &apos;re going to be familiar with , when you look at this artwork again .
then this awkward feeling , this awkward feeling , you can &apos;t see see , and it &apos;s going to be more similar .
here you have this mechanism that we can tell the lie as a great invention of our <unk> , to our <unk> .
and not only in the art , in the <unk> , in the the mythology of the , in stories .
you may know this idea of the lady that the the the the morning and looked at the mirror , and asked asked who who the beautiful beautiful in
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> . .
behind the seven mountains , and on .
and you also know how much hostility out of this true tells , the mirror can &apos;t lie out of this true city .
but we should just do to familiar with that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a a <unk> somewhere else .
here it &apos;s necessary that we understand under the <unk> of <unk> , , and and .
we need to this this lie that lie that the the the deception , we can &apos;t survive .
we have not just in the art , in the <unk> , , but in science , it &apos;s great .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman from <unk> .
she heard heard of this book by charles darwin , and the origin of species and the of of people .
that the man should be to the , and , yes , yes , it &apos;s at at least a shared between people and monkeys .
and then she ran them to her husband and said said , &quot; well , that &apos;s not true , that &apos;s charles &apos;s on . .
the man should be <unk> from the monkeys or a a a .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent people of of people know .
why have we have to know that people know about something if it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live without these <unk> .
because we &apos;re this self-deception , this feeling , to be great , from from the highest nature , not by one of these <unk> , , of such a <unk> , , as something like this , is to to the and or what things that is ,
so , we can &apos;t &apos;t have these things .
we have to prevent people know about things things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanism is out and and how the look look like that &apos;s leaving , on this wonderful image of ourselves , , i want to to you another story of you .
one particularly beautiful story , i mean .
my wife told me me .
she came out of school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told about a student .
a student student .
she likes to him because it &apos;s an tendency for it .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and here he says , well , i &apos;m at the factory .
and because i am in the factory department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yeah , you feel it if you &apos;re <unk> at this point . there &apos;s not something .
i said told my wife , whenever a man in a moral <unk> , because because because , because we should to try to replace it through the <unk> .
and you do that once and then you know the sentence .
although i &apos;m in the factory department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
you feel that this is the real truth behind which tells us .
so a little <unk> , which is not interested in <unk> .
that &apos;s interested in <unk> .
but there &apos;s not clubs , we can look around , where you learn how to learn how to do .
there &apos;s only the best thing , the fire fire .
he was signed up .
and <unk> , you also say &apos;t say his teacher is that you wanted to be fires and and when you &apos;re to , if the fire &apos;s <unk> .
no , it just looks much better when we show that we are in to the the of the that the other only , when they put fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
this this <unk> that this <unk> that at the <unk> of the <unk> , , that it &apos;s related to the fire , but that can &apos;t tell that .
here you have this <unk> between the unconscious and the conscious , that immediately , , without you can do something about it , and the things that you know about , and things that you know , it &apos;s a very different way to you and it it .
and then just then just like words that we &apos;re in the the language of political young , and again .
actually , we know that something else is .
but we know if we we that , , the social of the social , very sensitive to the .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible , things like things in a society that &apos;s to to to present .
i want to to tell you what we &apos;ve found in the institute .
after what logic of deception , this self-deception , the willingness , another reality of reality that we actually actually in the unconscious realize that they &apos;re valid to spread out .
i , i want to give you two , maybe three examples of them .
the first example of what many of you know , and some of you appreciate , some of you , just not &apos;t all all .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is a mental , , says , about about .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not stop by stop , physical physical .
and if you have people people who have the the best belief that they have a soul , or you can tell you that that you &apos;ve been brought to the to the , then , that &apos;s like , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , .
and from that soul , you think that somehow , in in this <unk> nature , in this <unk> , , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the , , , mind .
and if this <unk> , then , the people , , it &apos;s filled with , with , with , with nature , with , , , with , , with soul .
and then he can <unk> <unk> .
this is the idea of what the soul is .
so it &apos;s to to go along from outside .
so we should to to what what to be what to be to our life to our life .
and if you have this assumption , you know , the logic , which is to to see that happiness , by a lie through a lie .
because now , can use a <unk> . .
you know , you know , from school .
now this is a a <unk> that &apos;s a a logic that describes a logic .
this is the way of the most difficult part in my talk .
here &apos;s what &apos;s logic , but also the willingness to lie .
because that &apos;s what they can just be wrong wrong .
in this <unk> , three sentences .
the first sentence is , <unk> , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if you &apos;re right , he doesn &apos;t have soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i &apos;ve him in here .
a third sentence that is up to people who have a strong sense of a soul .
they say who don &apos;t have soul , who is dead and and can &apos;t claim anything .
and here &apos;s you you .
here &apos;s this logic in this , yes , in this <unk> talk in the <unk> talk .
you can see it immediately .
the first two sentences that are important accurate .
because i can claim that .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell about about reality .
i can say , the <unk> is a man .
and if i right , , the &apos;s a man .
if i don &apos;t right , the don &apos;t have a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t think about what &apos;s true .
i can claim that .
but the critical is , if i right , it &apos;s it &apos;s .
so if <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he right , he doesn &apos;t have soul .
these things are logical accurate .
and now , our <unk> consciousness is , you can do it .
it depends on a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences and who is the opposite of the first sentence already proven and and already .
because actually , we have to prove whether it &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that just using it , that two sentences are accurate , and one third <unk> that looks like like it would like to do with it , we can save our <unk> our . .
so , we do , it &apos;s actually impossible to can &apos;t be able to live without a soul .
and we are very happy about it .
we can continue these things on various different things .
in the present , we have a very modern modern example , that always <unk> the <unk> .
here , to have to to another <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , , mind .
this has to do it that we we go back to the <unk> century .
there there was an scholars who was the johannes <unk> , after after that is the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> that has a of of .
it doesn &apos;t have the soul .
this is such a <unk> . .
and if you put the exact in the middle between two <unk> <unk> , then he <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a search to to first .
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
so the the <unk> .
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> <unk> to different .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
just if you take another example , so you you make a little a a little makes you , it doesn &apos;t need reason reason , and nothing .
automatically it starts to the right thoughts .
if you have this idea that you &apos;re sort of driven by the , , , , the the bigger pile of the bigger pile that you put in , , you also feel feel like that it &apos;s something like
and if we &apos;re already in the <unk> in the , , i remember in the <unk> of brain .
there &apos;s an scholars who is wolf &apos;s number , and and he says say , he says , wolf &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s no <unk> .
now we can make the second sentence , and say , if wolf has <unk> right , he doesn &apos;t have a .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can do is to read a daily daily daily daily , you find that this third sentence .
it looks like that , who doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , doesn &apos;t have to have their action and claims to responsibility and fall to responsibility and and it &apos;s &apos;s <unk> .
here you again again .
actually , you have to prove to be if there &apos;s something like <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do it as the first sentence of the first hit the first sentence of the , , you &apos;d just like to take the opposite without no evidence .
and now you can just do if you want to do anything if you want to test anything , and , and , , if you want to make people happy , they want to to to lie to lie .
practice for example , if you look at a people , you can say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for <unk> , that prophet prophet .
you can &apos;t do that , that would be a little bit more politically <unk> .
you say , there &apos;s no <unk> . .
immediately , you will be a for of the , of course , there &apos;s no way that you can &apos;t prove .
and you have a problem .
because as you &apos;re busy , you you you you can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no <unk> , , is the man happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s them .
because he got it on a <unk> , he he doesn &apos;t get ourselves .
because it &apos;s not interested in human .
it &apos;s only interested in in the , need to prove to prove to prove that there &apos;s a <unk> .
so , in the kind of shift shift the the of lie .
and if you again , if you have one way to feel that <unk> to other people , you do it , because they &apos;re going to make other happy if you don &apos;t remember that in that way .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good day .
i i asked asked asked to i i it to say it .
she &apos;s one of the most of here from this this this this and asked me if i wanted to have a talk and i my my idea .
i have to say , you have got it , it , i had to to to to about my idea .
and i may imagine that my favorite reason that i &apos;m trying to introduce you .
but it &apos;s of course , the sum very , very many of ideas .
i probably think , are two nice nice girls , i &apos;m probably probably probably to the generation that has been taken to this bad image , , because i &apos;ve been to study engineering to study engineering in <unk> , , , , , , , i think , .
and then i got it in the the years after berlin , because i wanted to make renewable energy , and that didn &apos;t have that in <unk> .
there were the <unk> <unk> .
because of the , , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> was called <unk> .
that &apos;s <unk> today .
because a good engineer is either making great car , or <unk> .
but the <unk> of like like , , from the , of a space out of the square space , which was a toy toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m grateful for the <unk> that he he the the word again again because because you couldn &apos;t have the word to the word , because everything was all left , because everything was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t that in the the in the .
there was a little that that there was <unk> <unk> and and one of them was in in <unk> in the <unk> where you make bad bad .
and the place , the <unk> , but it was was was was and wind and and and was the the <unk> .
and yes , a lot of what was told today , very , because many , many , many , many beautiful expressions of i &apos;ve also lived through .
i &apos;ve been working on the collective , , which was <unk> .
we were 20 people .
if if you said no , it was the <unk> , , has a totally <unk> , i i i &apos;ve been hard to do it , i i really really to to a a <unk> thing , because , because all of my father &apos;s have been <unk> to your own , you have have the money to your my father .
it &apos;s busy with it .
and that was really , very , very , , and you will also in in such an , , , , that one , in a where i asked , after 10 years , a thousand , , , , , , , , , , really , , really , really , really , really , really , .
and i &apos;ve got to <unk> <unk> , and then we &apos;ve had the <unk> of the company , which then the <unk> <unk> of one of the largest <unk> of of the world was the world .
so , a <unk> , , but we , of course , we have the problem of a business company , and we have <unk> , , a small group , that we we start back and and and and , and , and it &apos;s the the , , and it &apos;s the way , it &apos;s the , , and it &apos;s the way to think about what &apos;s the , that , it &apos;s the way to do it , and it &apos;s the way that people think , is
and i &apos;ve me you a project that i want to you now to imagine .
and the title of the talk was , yes , you know , you &apos;ve got to a hundred percent renewable .
and we just just started to a a <unk> story , asking where you you could be in a memory .
this island , this is the island <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
there &apos;s a four and a thousand people .
they have a renewables renewables from 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have any more ?
that &apos;s just not technological technological .
if you &apos;re more more <unk> each other , it starts to fail .
i &apos;m always telling you about the politicians , when you put in in our facility .
and they say say , why ?
we &apos;ve have been 20 percent in germany .
but can &apos;t be any problem .
but , not , we have seven percent , and we have seven percent and our net , the european .
if we had 20 20 percent , we have have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was was , , the the that was the first contacts with the island , just expect to .
how big needs to be a battery , so you could be a battery in 20 , 40 , 40 40 40 , 50 , maybe 50 percent renewable .
and yes , i &apos;m going to take a a .
the conventional system looks looks like the the world .
by the way , a year , about a hundred <unk> at <unk> space <unk> in the world .
this is the to a hundred power power power power power , because it &apos;s especially quickly everywhere .
the the world that &apos;s going to be <unk> with , because because you don &apos;t need any permission .
this is quickly .
you get this is why .
and then it looks like this .
in the , three , three of the <unk> , , two are always waited .
yeah , this is what &apos;s looks at the bottom .
we also have a very accurate data .
and the <unk> or the or or whatever it is , is a a system in the or or a system or or a system , which is just into small small amounts here .
and our goal was to to say , okay , okay .
the the is <unk> and the wind , the the the burden , the burden that you can get the wider of of .
and if you &apos;re over 20 , 30 percent renewables energy , so energy per year , not the power to the moment , you have to turn the the .
that means that you have to make sure that renewables , all of the way to get the entire entire network .
you can only be , you , in any way , it &apos;s managed to be managed .
so , no one &apos;s been doing this .
that &apos;s what &apos;s in the little scale , so you can also go into the car in the a little <unk> .
people always ask me , what are you going to do in in ?
this is already .
but if you want to build up of these <unk> , and that want to build a grid , it &apos;s become complicated complicated .
and our goal was to be , we we to percent to percent of and then there &apos;s still this one , the last last 10 , 20 percent renewable with , , becomes very , very expensive , and it won &apos;t work that you &apos;re going to do that .
that &apos;s going to be a energy energy , , , , hydrogen , methane , power to the gas you can you or <unk> , that &apos;s going to be it .
they have to go to a <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and not just <unk> .
we just wanted to know what what about a normal , <unk> battery battery .
how far do you get ? ?
and then a whole lot of simulations did .
and the wind and the sun and the load and and the end , a very exciting conclusion that you &apos;re going to the the the conventional a , , 20 years , a a a <unk> , of about 50 cents a per <unk> , , about about 50 cents a <unk> . .
these were the very first of in six years ago .
and then we said , okay , ok .
so , is great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the <unk> , when the <unk> five percent per year .
and then we started negotiate with the <unk> .
what would you have to be done ?
having <unk> , i &apos;ve been looking for a new new . .
we were only in the at the time , to build a society in order to build society .
and here &apos;s a representation .
the brown is , the the becomes the conventional system , the green is our system .
that is also a a system that we have a a <unk> , , and we &apos;re even 20 percent of the , and they don &apos;t <unk> the other things .
and the <unk> that that the the the the island , , , that &apos;s what we find .
we we also want to support , but we don &apos;t think you you can solve the problem problem .
and so we decided to build a in berlin in a hall that which which we &apos;re sort of the electrical world of the island of the island in one one .
that means we we &apos;re looking at the greatest battery of the world .
here it is .
it &apos;s naturally <unk> from asia , in the case of japan .
and <unk> is in the 1970s , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , , and , and then <unk> and then the japanese was the japanese .
you you can see it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
it has an dumb megawatts and and can take the power for six hours , and that &apos;s the battery that we have sort of <unk> <unk> .
and then put it up .
we also have one of these <unk> in the same size , it &apos;s there in the the in the the , actually the entire dynamic behavior of this web , so in the the , in the the , is the the , , here is the the of , here , here &apos;s the <unk> .
over here , we &apos;ll simulate the whole <unk> , the the the cable , to sort of the the the the the the the .
and here you can see again , again , you can see it again .
we can also <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the the .
here we see here again again , again , again , the the , , again , the whole , .
and what we &apos;ve done since since then , the the was the the , until now , everything that what &apos;s the between the the the the of the , to the , we &apos;ve done .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , , we &apos;re define define as a company that &apos;s only between battery and the subject of the and and the the issue .
you have to communicate to the battery battery , you can also communicate to the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty is the beauty of the , this is basically the the of the things that can be , in the that we we get to get if we want to increase our our our our own our own our own our own our own our
so this whole discussion , how it &apos;s going back to the moment , and <unk> , , how to to go to the island , , we &apos;re to percent percent percent <unk> , , so we <unk> the the wind , and the sun .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
so <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
we can can on the island of the , to , , , , , can you can can you can you can .
that means if you &apos;re 70 percent renewable , you won &apos;t be able to do that .
you can <unk> by <unk> , you can take through <unk> , yes , you should do it , even though , but you will never going to light , but you never get to light light .
and that &apos;s this is the the .
so lots of people come and look at this , you can see , you can see what they &apos;re .
if we shut the the , , you don &apos;t have more these around more around the more of the in the grid .
and our <unk> <unk> is essentially <unk> <unk> from from from big <unk> , where where the wave wave is all around europe .
we look into this net , we see see the hertz , and when it &apos;s <unk> point nine hertz , we &apos;ll start a a <unk> , , then we &apos;ll get a little <unk> steam steam , then we get up back up .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , this is incredibly <unk> .
if you get it somewhere somewhere , it &apos;s a little bit .
the <unk> reserves has at least 10 seconds to keep the net .
and over time , can react another another .
if you don &apos;t have that more , this around mass , then you have to replace it with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can get with this big battery , two milliseconds .
you you see see , there &apos;s enormous <unk> of there .
and the message is , we have to to to to these rotating masses , if we were our goals , 20 , twenty percent , twenty percent , 40 , 30 , 30 , 40 , , you want to reach
then we have to break our <unk> capacity on the net .
<unk> is simply called the power power to the power to to the frequency .
yeah , that &apos;s a <unk> moment in the moment , <unk> from the <unk> , because because we don &apos;t otherwise , or because because that &apos;s not .
and we just try to ideas that you to create the capacity capacity capacity capacity , can can break into the to <unk> to
now , there are now a lot of studies now .
and to this purpose , people are coming to and look at our <unk> of our <unk> , in the way .
and yes , the discussion is all about the question , how far can you get a a of the future .
and many discussions i had had been in the last six years , was the the discussion i had been over the last 30 years .
not is it , , , <unk> , we we , we &apos;ll never do it .
we have <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk> . germany .
this is <unk> .
and i just go out of that , the next 30 years , we store the same capacity for the same capacity for the world .
so it &apos;s going to come .
there &apos;s going to be a lot of of <unk> and and .
the beauty is that i &apos;ve experienced in the last two years now that the scientists are on on my page .
we &apos;ve now got about 10 million <unk> , also , to <unk> <unk> now to <unk> german net .
that &apos;s going to be happen in april april .
so , you know , you you see that there is a change there and and it &apos;s just about this <unk> , , the idea of the , , a a percent of that &apos;s true .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable renewable , it &apos;s like a a system .
far far , in &apos;ve been tried to , , these <unk> , , which are <unk> , which have a own small network , that has to do with our own . .
and the question is really easy , if you &apos;re all all of any of , or <unk> <unk> , <unk> , somewhere in the world , and you &apos;re going to be <unk> , and you &apos;re
then they only use that , they &apos;re the sun and wind is where they live .
and this is a kind of our our vision of a <unk> energy supply , and i &apos;m grateful for they said , they &apos;ve been the energy .
and that &apos;s what we do , and in this , , in this , , the talk , <unk> <unk> , you can be a collective and the energy , , here &apos;s a little together .
and yeah , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be a little crazy and also can have a vision .
and you really have to stay really pretty <unk> , but i think that &apos;s going to .
thank you .
when steve lopez , <unk> of los angeles times , one day through the street of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came up from a man , an <unk> , , , , , , homeless , on on a violin , which had two strings .
many of you are the story of the story , because from a <unk> article about it later , a book that was a book , which was <unk> by steve <unk> and jamie <unk> and jamie <unk> <unk> <unk> and and his quite a career , very , very quite a , very , very quite a career , very on the early school of
nathaniel left <unk> , , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later he he he had a homeless on on the streets of <unk> row at the center of los angeles .
i suggest to tell you all the <unk> book , or watch the movie , so you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful argument that you have evolved between these two men , but also how music is making this connection , and how they had the instrument , the <unk> , , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 years ago , in walt disney <unk> hall .
he had just heard a a of beethoven &apos;s first and and and she came out the stage and the stage to to me .
he talked in a very <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and clinton clinton about how the dodgers would never going to create the baseball , and all of this , and all the the of the the of of beethoven &apos;s in the last sentence .
we came to talk to the , and a few days later , i got an email , where , had been <unk> for me , was interested in .
i have to mention that nathaniel civil a medical care , because he was already been with electrical electrical and and and and and , , a trauma that has his his his whole life .
now , as a result , it &apos;s a very vulnerable to those schizophrenic stages , and they are so bad , and he would be that , , in the streets of <unk> row , , and the <unk> of its own own mind .
and in one <unk> , nathaniel <unk> , when we first started to our first class in walt disney hall -- he had this <unk> <unk> <unk> in his eyes and and , .
he talked about invisible about invisible and smoke and and how to poison him in sleep .
i was afraid , not <unk> , i &apos;d afraid i could lose him in one of his , and that i could could break his relationship to the violin , when i started to talk about musical and and and and and and more forms of the <unk> forms .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s &apos;s <unk> .
and as i played , i realized that in a total of of a complete change was going to be a .
it was like if it was under the influence of a invisible drug , a chemical reaction , that a a to be .
<unk> <unk> <unk> both transformed into a a quiet curiosity and .
and as a miracle he took his violin , and i started to play some some few clips of <unk> , and asked me to play them to play : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we then started talking about music , about beethoven , , , , , , , and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to to <unk> to <unk> .
and i realized that it &apos;s not just a <unk> knowledge of music , but it it with it , and it &apos;s a very smart personal .
he spoke talking about her with a passion and an understanding that i only ever know about my colleagues in the <unk> of of los angeles .
by playing music and music about music , was about this <unk> , confused man , <unk> , <unk> , , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
nathaniel presents , music a emotional .
because the music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in something real .
and so he <unk> <unk> states .
i understood that that is the the of the art .
and this is why why we do music : so we do something that we &apos;re in all , deep inside of our , our feelings , through our art , through our our creativity , our our creativity .
and the reality of that expression is us all us , and inspired , inspired and it .
it was <unk> , it brought it back to a community of friends .
the power power of music brought brought back into a family of musicians that him understood him that his talent saw and him .
and i &apos;m going to play with nathaniel , , no no to in to disney hall , <unk> hall , because he reminds me why i am a musician .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i &apos;ve stolen the <unk> .
i hope you would forgive me .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish .
i only loved two .
this first first , this was more like a passionate kind of a passionate .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good , , <unk> , <unk> on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he got to be the most <unk> to the the the of sustainability .
so you could feel about it to sell it .
i had a beauty about a about a bunch of a .
one day , the boss of the company , and i asked if i could give you an event about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company that was trying to do this , for our , , we have have a fish for our .
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve made the sea of we were <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s hard to to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the great fish that love that , the , the the , the , the , , , , <unk> , <unk> , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , will be , , , , , , , part of our future .
many arguments are against it . <unk> <unk> the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , and &apos;re going to take tuna . a great disadvantage
he &apos;s got a <unk> of 15 to one .
that means , 15 pounds of <unk> to get you get a pounds of <unk> .
not very sustainable .
tastes aren &apos;t tastes very well .
so here finally , a company finally tried to do it right .
i wanted to supported them .
and day day , i , the boss boss of the <unk> for the company .
we call it don .
&quot; don don &apos;t &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts , you &apos;re famous for that far out as far out out of the ocean , you don &apos;t
&quot; that &apos;s said , &quot; said , &quot; we &apos;re so far out that that the waste is going to be distributed , not focused . &quot;
and then he added it , &quot; we &apos;re basically a a world .
this <unk> of <unk> , one , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
one , one , great .
&quot; to one one ? what are you feeds ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said .
and i that night i was in bed , i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , shortly before the event , don don don .
i said , &quot; don don &apos;t know , what example , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s an <unk> .
now , i &apos;m a with some people in the company . no one could give me a proper answer until i finally , to the senior fellow named .
let &apos;s call it don don &apos;t .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what , &quot; what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
now he mentioned some algae , some some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , <unk> , skin , <unk> , <unk> , and and and and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your is is chicken ? &quot;
in the two percent .
&quot; well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don don &apos;t , what &apos;s sustainable to feed chicken fish ? &quot;
there was a long time in the line and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i &apos;m <unk> that fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that &apos;s me .
no , i actually have <unk> <unk> by this fish , because , i swear to god with god , that &apos;s going to get that entertainment after chicken .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love .
it &apos;s the romantic way that you you , in the way you know , you know know , you learn the you learn the the the the more .
i first ate it first in a restaurant restaurant .
a journalist journalist had been a a long time of this fish .
it &apos;s got a <unk> of .
he came up to the table with a light almost <unk> white color .
the chef had <unk> him .
get twice .
but amazingly , it was delicious .
who can can a fish so good , after it it &apos;s <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
let &apos;s call it <unk> . . actually , he &apos;s <unk> .
and no , he &apos;s not cooking , and it &apos;s not a chef , at at the way that you and and i can understand it .
he &apos;s a biologist biologist <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in in the <unk> of of spain .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the stream .
until the 1980s , the the to the the of the <unk> .
they raised <unk> in what what was the wetlands .
they made that by making the land .
they built this complicated complicated of channels today and and they get water water from the land and out out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t do that that didn &apos;t work economically .
and <unk> was a disaster .
it brought it 90 percent of the birds , which are a lot of birds .
and so 1982 has a spanish company , where where the land .
what did they do ?
they &apos;ve the the river of water versa .
they literally have the lever of the .
instead of the water <unk> they used the channels to make the water water .
they <unk> the channels .
they created created a 11,000 hectares of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp shrimp -- <unk> -- and <unk> -- and and his company , and the the the the
the farm is incredible incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
they look out out the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you &apos;re seeing is <unk> channels and these density , lush march .
i was not a long time with <unk> .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three pieces of the and a part a <unk> a <unk> . &quot;
okay ? there were we fought with the wetlands and and and <unk> and <unk> , , and i <unk> to my knees , and <unk> <unk> in a .
here he &apos;s a a a rare <unk> .
now he mentioned the <unk> of of . .
and here , here &apos;s a a pattern of concentrate it to the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that <unk> that the most part of his career in in in national park in africa .
i asked him how to become such a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i know nothing about fish .
i am an expert on relationships . &quot;
and then he goes , and over , and more <unk> of rare birds and algae and bizarre <unk> .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , this was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community community , , in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was love love .
and my head became a weak of this <unk> fish that i had on the .
so i cut him . i said , &quot; <unk> , how do you taste your fish is so good ? &quot;
he showed on the algae .
&quot; i know , young , the algae , the , , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what does your fish eat ?
how is the <unk> ? &quot;
well , he goes to to tell me that it &apos;s a a system that &apos;s that the fish that they eat in the wild .
the vegetable biomass , the , the the , , it &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally <unk> .
there &apos;s no food .
ever about any farm that don &apos;t stop their animals ?
i i went on the the site on this site with <unk> , and i said , &quot; for a place that be so of course , be , , any farm that i have been , &quot; how do you stop ? &quot;
in the moment , it was a film director said a a <unk> .
and we put around around the corner , and the most incredible sight of the , , thousands and thousands of the brothers , , literally , so that that that that far as the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at her <unk> , pink .
she <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you your eyes ? &quot;
&quot; yes , he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the birds .
well last year , had had had 600,000 birds , more than 250 different ways .
it &apos;s the biggest thing , and one of the most important private sector in in europe .
i said , &quot; <unk> , is a good <unk> <unk> , not the last thing you want to have on a <unk> ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not intense .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
the &apos;s the the the the system the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink that . a farm that not not feeding and not not and a farm that measure their success on health .
a <unk> , , but also a a .
oh , by the way , the the , the the not even be there .
they they breed in a city about 240 miles where the <unk> is better is better for the <unk> .
every morning they save to go to farm .
and night she was 240 to .
they do it because they &apos;re the <unk> white white <unk> of the <unk> .
seriously .
i i thought of a of the penguins , so i looked at .
i said , &quot; <unk> , fly to to to farm farm and fly then 240 miles down ?
do you do that for the ? &quot;
he looked at me , when i just heard a song of whitney houston houston .
he said , &quot; no . they do this because because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like her . i don &apos;t like her <unk> .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
i &apos;ll cook of of it .
and yet , when i try it in this restaurant in <unk> , , she didn &apos;t get it for <unk> .
she liked sweet sweet and they would like if you take a bite off the ocean .
i mentioned that to <unk> and and it &apos;s <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
she &apos;s the last <unk> before something something into the body .
she &apos;s evolved over evolution evolution , to <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that don &apos;t stop their fish , a farm that on their success on their their .
and then i realized when he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , , it &apos;s a huge , because the water that comes through through this farm , in the in the river <unk> .
it &apos;s a river that leads all of things things that are about these days , they tend to lead them , chemical pollutants , from <unk> .
and if it fought by the system , and this leaves is the water clean clean clean , as it is <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s water water .
so not just a farm that not not not feeding their animals , not just a farm that measure their success on health health , but a farm that literally is a a <unk> , and not just for these fish , but for you .
because if the water <unk> , , it &apos;s in the atlantic .
in drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , because this is how whatever whatever is whatever whatever is is also telling .
you might say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future , if we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> , or <unk> .
now , what we need is is a radical new new from agriculture , from one that actually taste good .
but for a lot of people , it &apos;s a little bit radical .
we are not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we &apos;re talking about local food . we need organic food .
and if you claim that that are the things that are good food is someone somewhere somewhere and says , &quot; hey , i love love <unk> <unk> , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
may i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , no , because we already produce enough calories to feed the world more than only .
one billion people are starving .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of the in in distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i don &apos;t like that question because you &apos;re the logic of our <unk> last 50 years .
so <unk> the of of , , <unk> <unk> chemicals , chemicals earth , the the , fish , and all the time , they were simply said , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how terrible can it be ? &quot;
this was the cause . it was the local business , it was the business plan of the american agriculture .
we should call them what she is , a <unk> in in <unk> , an industry , an industry , <unk> <unk> capital that allowed that to make this production .
this is not an icon , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our <unk> is is threatened today , not because of <unk> , , but because of the , , , but because of the resources .
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but not by the land , not pump by fresh water , but by by fresh water , but by <unk> , and not through <unk> and nets , but by by <unk> fish .
they want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable any community to feed themselves ?
so to do that , don &apos;t look at the the future for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are standing in it and and it has never really done something really good to eat .
let &apos;s look at the very important model .
this is that that &apos;s two billion years of <unk> <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
businesses that aren &apos;t worlds for those , businesses , the , of , , , , , , , , , just <unk> , , , , not only people who are not not to to , but experts experts .
because they are the ones who are also experts .
and if i really really , you &apos;re a better chef when i ever ever .
you know , that &apos;s me , because if that &apos;s the future is good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to to see this thing today about this is that the of the data that we consume , bigger than the sum of your parts , and instead of thinking about the , i think that you &apos;re thinking about how we can use information that that we can &apos;t see that that , and we see that that that we can &apos;t see that that ,
so , what we &apos;re seeing is a typical <unk> after age .
the program that i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter up to a particular case , we say accidents .
and immediately , i see another pattern that makes it .
and that &apos;s because in the most of here are the most active are are most active , and they &apos;re over here the the .
we can move further step further and then can the data data and and see that the <unk> and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
now , when we go on and and , , , we spend 40 years or or younger , we we know that accidents even the main cause of people should care about people .
and who &apos;s <unk> that this is is this is true with men .
so you realize that this is the information of information information and data in this way in this is a a in a living a living . .
and if we can do this for data data , and why not do it for content ?
now , what we &apos;ve here is the most of the <unk> sport , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; that ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can like to test it after my talk in their favorite . .
you can get them in a decade .
they can get dive into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain issue .
now , when i look here , i see the athlete that appear in this that comes and the the .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong , so i click so i get all of my my , my <unk> .
now , if i want to get a <unk> of , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at all of the topic ? &quot;
so i go going to step back and look at the view .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get a idea that if you you on this kind of information , , , , bigger , wider , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t not not not just not not .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s something between between and and we think it changes the way that can be used .
now , i want to take this idea of a bit bit bit of a bit bit of a bit bit .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single single , , and it it down a little bit .
it &apos;s the summary , this is a quick picture and a symbol of it comes out .
i just show the top 500 the top of the .
but even in this <unk> , we can do a lot of things .
now , we get a impression about the issues that are at the .
i &apos;m going to choose the subject .
now , i i my government , i know that the <unk> that the most of the most the most is the the . &quot;
this is really important , because this is a insight that not in a single <unk> .
that &apos;s just to if you go back and look at it .
now , on a of these summaries , i can go into the subject of time in the year , and all of the .
now , if i look at all these these people , i think that the majority of them are <unk> . some of the come from science . some even less , come from the . here &apos;s my boss . here &apos;s my boss .
and interestingly , bono is a a ted prize .
so we can jump and look at all of all the ted prize .
you see , we we &apos;re surfing the the the first time , it &apos;s really a a , not only page , but more abstract .
and so i want to show you what different things that might be a little surprise .
i just show you here just the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser &apos;s &apos;s not really browser , but you can look at websites -- and we bring these <unk> to every single website like this .
so i can go back a step back and directly to a specific <unk> of jump .
this is why because you only only through through this , in this way , and the whole way that can look at the same way .
so i can zoom in in my course of a .
here &apos;s the the of the entire demonstration of this i had to go .
and i can sort of anything i &apos;ve seen today , now , again .
and if i look back to a step , and i can see everything , i can start to my my way , maybe i , i i to look for the <unk> , , , i &apos;ve been looking for to go to go , or here
and from here , i can go into the page and go you to to .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used again , and it &apos;s it &apos;s the big bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
right now , in the world , we think that data is a curse .
we talk about the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning in &quot; . &quot;
what if we can turn around these situation and and the internet on the web , so instead of going to , rather than to to to a lot of things , you can go to many things , and and patterns that would be were always away ?
if we can do this , then this past is <unk> , maybe a a new source of information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get out of it .
and if we know know , we can even draw <unk> from it .
i &apos;m listening to , thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> portion of science fiction .
in my high school , i went to school school , day , every day .
and my nose would be in in a book , a <unk> , which is my my thoughts in other worlds and and in my deep way , <unk> <unk> curiosity .
these curiosity showed himself that i always , if i was not in school , the forests , and and and and and and and and and snakes and snakes and <unk> and and , everything , and put it back under the microscope .
i was completely <unk> , you know .
and it was always about trying to understand the world and the the the of the .
and my love science fiction to to one day , because because in the late &apos; 60s , we flew flew the the the the the the the the the the .
jacques cousteau came into our <unk> <unk> amazing shows that animals and and places and a a world of miracles that we could never have before .
and that &apos;s what i think was all good at the <unk> .
and i was artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since it &apos;s not or video games , the <unk> movies , the the the imagery at the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we had to do that at all . if we read a a book , we took the the description of the <unk> , and we the the on the canvas .
my response was to draw this was , and draw from aliens , alien worlds , robots , <unk> and all of this .
in the , i was caught the the the teachers , the the base cold , <unk> .
creativity had to be out of .
and something interesting happened something interesting . what i me to jacques <unk> &apos;s <unk> , the thought of a a entirely unknown world in our earth .
i mean , i would never get a a world a a , and that seemed very unlikely .
but here was a world that i actually actually come into , here on earth , and it was just fascinating and and as all of what i had imagined when i had imagined these books .
so i decided to get when i was 15 to become a .
the only problem that was that i lived in a small village in canada , 100,000 miles from from the ocean .
i didn &apos;t get <unk> .
i <unk> my father until until finally finally a a <unk> in buffalo , new york , had had on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in in a pool of the in in in , in in , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got to to to face , and i got to california .
since , in the years , , in the , , i &apos;ve gone about about hours hours , and hours hours , 500 hours of it .
and i learned that the the world of the deep sea , even in the <unk> oceans , so rich life , so rich life , how we can really imagine .
nature &apos;s of nature known no boundaries , no to our own , <unk> human imagination .
so to today , i feel very deepest awe for what i see on on .
and my love love in the ocean , the same intensity as well and ever .
so when i came to an adult job , it was the filmmaking .
that seemed to be the best way to tell my inner to tell stories to my need to create to use .
when i drew my <unk> books and i made myself books .
so , movies were their way to to images and and together . that fit together .
of course stories , the stories i i had , from the <unk> , &quot; &quot; , &quot; aliens , &quot; aliens , &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &quot; <unk> &quot; i could i my for for the <unk> and and the the to the to .
so so , of these are are are the two passions .
something interesting happened in the <unk> , &quot; to solve a <unk> problem in this film -- and we had to create a kind of liquid <unk> -- we we on to animation , , , on <unk> , , back .
and what &apos;s came out , the first <unk> <unk> was the ever been in a film .
the film was no money , , he just playing the possible , he he had a a , , , but i realized this : the the the the the world was <unk> by the the magic , you went out .
according to arthur arthur clarke &apos;s law are actually <unk> technology and magic &apos;s not different different from each other .
so , they saw something magical .
and that found that i found incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this must be involved in the <unk> . . &quot;
so we went in &quot; <unk> , &quot; and , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; next &quot; , &quot; a lot of .
and with with <unk> , we we the guys of liquid metal , and the success was on the the was going to come .
and it worked . again , we created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we &apos;ve got a little bit of a little bit more money .
from these two experiences , was been able to build a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity .
so i started a company , with with good friend , <unk> who who was the best best <unk> and <unk> , was was was &quot; digital <unk> . &quot;
the idea of this company company was to be <unk> processes with its printers and <unk> and and start with the digital <unk> .
and we did that , and did us to a a for a while .
but in the middle &apos; 90s , we discovered that we in the <unk> and <unk> -- what we did for -- to what we actually did -- to slow <unk> .
i had written this piece of this &quot; avatar , which that the stick to the to do things in the whole new new and <unk> effects of the , with really important human , , compelling characters that were made by <unk> , and the world should be <unk> .
but the stick got it back to , and the people in my company told me that we haven &apos;t even able to be able to do that .
so i shifted this and i this to the other film about the big ship , going to fall .
i i the <unk> , i i this as &quot; and juliet on a ship &quot; it was a <unk> <unk> magnitude , a a a a .
but , but i wanted to look at the real <unk> of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
this is the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
but convinced you , i said , &quot; we go to the guy , we film the real <unk> .
we &apos;re going to show it in the the of the film .
this is important important . it &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot;
and i prefer to pay an expedition expedition .
sounds crazy . but it goes back again , that that you can do a reality .
and then we actually then then a a reality , a a , in a a , a russian <unk> <unk> , , four miles under the north atlantic , and i was the real titanic through the <unk> .
this was not a film , no <unk> , that was really .
so , really my mind .
and the <unk> to to this . we had to make cameras and the and and all kinds of things .
and i noticed how much these <unk> , , similar similar .
well , they were also <unk> and and more powerful planning .
you go into this capsule , you &apos;re in this dark , <unk> , <unk> environment , where where no hope is if you don &apos;t have a .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is just as as i &apos;m in a <unk> .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was literally obsessed with the study of the deep sea .
anyway , anyway , part of the part of curiosity and science . it was all . it was adventure , it was . .
and it was an experience that i could not give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a a creature that could make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t think that what i was going to see outside of the <unk> .
in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen any of in <unk> , and sometimes things that i never seen before before , sometimes things that had seen else before , and the the that the science at the time , when we saw , , we were &apos;t have seen .
so that &apos;s me really <unk> , and i wanted to .
and so i met a a a bit of an extraordinary decision .
after the the of &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to to my my as a filmmaker in hollywood on ice and and i &apos;ll going to a for a while . &quot;
and then we started to the , we &apos;ve been the <unk> , and they studying it .
we went back to the the .
we took small robots that we built that a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , to look at the inside of the ship , and was never been done before .
nobody one had been the inside of the <unk> , you had no means of it . so we have the technology .
well , i &apos;m sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> that these <unk> , which is quite similar and and i i know that once that once had the band .
and i put a little <unk> on the <unk> of the ship .
i &apos;m just it it , , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically physically within the titanic of the titanic .
this was the most <unk> form of a <unk> that i ever experienced . because before i i a a <unk> , , i knew i had to be the the the of the vehicle , since i was months , when we had the film .
because the set was a a copy of the agreement .
so this was a very strange experience .
and she made me that this <unk> that you that you use such <unk> <unk> and so that you consciousness into the vehicle , in the the of of existence .
it was really incredibly profound profound profound .
and maybe a small view , what might might happen in some decades , if you could have to explore or to explore something or do anything , or other things , all sorts of <unk> that i can imagine as a <unk> .
after these expeditions , we started what we we we we we we , to to to to , for example , this <unk> , , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . these are sort of aliens , but here are on earth .
they live with the aid of <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight we can we do that .
and so you can see animals that at at a at a degrees centigrade , you can survive there .
at the same time , i was also very for <unk> , , was was a <unk> of my childhood .
and so i ended up at the people who are interested in space and and nasa and and the the the and and the <unk> , and you &apos;re to to russia , they go through russia , the mission to the the and and and , and , and , and , and , and , and , and , and ,
that was fascinating .
but then , it was out that i was to to the the in the deep .
i took them to and and them access to the world : down : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , people who interested in these extreme situations , i took them to the sources to take samples and use and and and and and and and and and and and and and .
we were in , but actually , science , , , , , .
so the the circle of my existence as a <unk> , as a child , and the to the reality .
and so , throughout the voyage of this voyage , i &apos;ve learned a lot of .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science . but i &apos;m sure you you &apos;re sure you can also have a an an , who have a leader like a <unk> or like this .
but i didn &apos;t mind a lot of leadership before i go these expeditions .
because at one point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why why do i do that ? what &apos;s going to ? &quot;
these <unk> movies bring us no money .
we &apos;re playing the possible . . can &apos;t be a .
everybody think i think i was between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i &apos;d &apos;d &apos;d like to break the nails on a towel on the .
i &apos;ve all these films , these are in this , for a very small audience .
no glory , no no , no money . what are you doing ?
you &apos;re it to the task to the challenge , the the ocean is the most <unk> environment that are . you &apos;re doing it because of the , because of the weird connection , which is a a a group of people .
because we &apos;ve been all this this with 10 to 12 age of people working for years , and we &apos;ve been two until two months until lake lake .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is be aware of you are you have one other , because you have an task that can tell you any one of you .
if you go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , , and the the way , , and the the , the the , , , you can &apos;t work , and you can &apos;t do it , you know , it &apos;s just like to you , you can &apos;t do it . this is how you you can &apos;t explain it .
there &apos;s a link , a each other .
so when i came back to to my next film , &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you &apos;re your team and making your together in .
and this is really changed the dynamic .
so , i stood back with a little team on <unk> terrain . we turned <unk> avatar with a new technology that didn haven &apos;t before .
incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we became a a period of a half a half a family .
and then , in the way that make movies , , completely .
there were people who thought we had had this <unk> <unk> and <unk> and to the planet .
for me , it was more more a way to do my job , the real process that has changed in the .
so what can we close out of all of this ?
what lessons from the lessons ?
i think first of the is the curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create reality .
and the are some of your team is more important than any of of the world .
and to me young filmmakers , who say , &quot; give me a advice of what i can do something like this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t you yourself .
you get some other for you . don &apos;t you yourself , bet , not &apos;t bet on yourself . but take risks . &quot;
nasa has this one <unk> , &quot; fail is not alternative . &quot;
but in the art , and to study , to be an alternative , because it &apos;s a a <unk> .
no important endeavor , that innovation was ever been without the risk .
you have to be ready to take these risks .
this is the idea that i want to to to to to to to , is not a alternative , fear is not . .
today i talk to you about about energy and climate .
and that &apos;s perhaps surprised to something because my favorite <unk> in the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seed and the things that we have to invent and deliver the poorest two billion a better lives .
but energy and climate is extremely important to these people , even more important than any other on the planet .
<unk> means that whose <unk> is not grow for many years , and we &apos;re too too too much . it &apos;s down too much rain , and things will going to change how it can &apos;t be able to be able
this leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to .
so , climate change is going to be an awful for you .
and also , the is very important for them .
in fact , if you could only reduce the price price price , the price of the , to the the most effective energy .
now , the <unk> is is time .
in fact , the <unk> is based on <unk> .
the <unk> drive the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there &apos;s a rapid case in the <unk> , and so we &apos;ve refrigerators up , air , we can make modern materials and so many things .
so we we &apos;re in a wonderful situation in the power in the .
but if we reduce the price price -- let &apos;s put the price in half -- we meet a new barrier , and this barrier coming together with co2 .
co2 warming the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they <unk> the co2 co2 co2 , which leads to the <unk> , and and this <unk> has a a some very negative consequences . effects , and maybe even worse , the the , that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to change change to change change and and the the of the .
now , the exact exact relationship between a <unk> and and the <unk> and and and where their follow , and there are some of , but there &apos;s not a lot of any .
and there &apos;s a ambiguity about how bad this , , but you &apos;ll be extremely bad .
and i asked the <unk> <unk> several times , &quot; we really have to get down down down to zero ?
can &apos;t get half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get to zero , it becomes going to go to the temperature .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a great challenge .
it &apos;s very different from saying , we have a 3.5 feet high truck that has to be under one feet , , and you can <unk> it .
this is what &apos;s to to down here . zero .
now , we get a lot of <unk> of , about 26 billion tons of tons .
everybody americans about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for each of the planet .
and somehow we need to produce changes that lower to down zero .
it &apos;s been a a .
only different economic changes , and we have to to reducing and to reducing increase and to reducing a reduction in zero .
this equation has four factors . a little of of . you have this thing -- -- co2 -- that you want to take to take a zero , and the of the of the , , the the of the , the the of the the the of the the the of the .
so , let &apos;s look at every one factor of one and we think about how to get it to zero .
probably , one numbers has to get to to the zero .
now this is a good algebra , but let &apos;s go it through .
first , we have the population .
today , are now <unk> billion people today .
and it &apos;s at 9 billion <unk> that to to over nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> , and we may be that it would be 10 percent percent , but at the time we &apos;re a a a .
the second factor is the services we use .
that &apos;s all that food food that we eat , clothes , tv , heat .
these are very good things and <unk> means to make these services almost almost to the planet .
it &apos;s great that that &apos;s is increasing .
in the rich world , the top billion , we could be able to do the and and , , but in the average , will be going to be up every year and more than than double , the number of services that will put together .
here is a very fundamental service , there &apos;s at home light , you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so you go out and read reading their your <unk> under the .
well , in efficiency , the e , energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
because of different successes in the <unk> , through other <unk> , through new methods in the , , there are many services , their energy , their energy are 90 percent .
in other of , like like the manufacturing , , 65 from , <unk> : <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , <unk> or <unk> , or the <unk> , is the for for improvements is much lot of improvements .
so in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , maybe we may get a reduction in a factor of three or maybe even by a factor .
but the first three three three , we &apos;re now from 26 billion to maybe a billion billion tons of maybe a <unk> . and it &apos;s just not enough !
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor factor -- and this is going to be a key device -- this is the amount of co2 that will going to energy energy .
it &apos;s the question , whether you can get it to zero .
they &apos;re burning coal : no .
and they burning natural natural : no .
almost every <unk> of of the co2 today , , beyond renewables and <unk> .
so what we need to do on a global level , is to create a new system .
we need <unk> . .
now , if i use the term &quot; miracles , i don &apos;t mean impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and services is a miracle .
people people people have people people of of of of this wonder .
usually there are no a that you need a a to a a a date .
you &apos;re just wrong , and some of you , not .
in this case , we have to give up and and a miracle in a very short time .
now , i asked , how can i really get this ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration of the to the the of people here ?
i remembered that last year when i got mosquitoes to and somehow people people it .
the idea was really tangible , you know know that there are people who live with live .
for that , i &apos;ve this this .
i decided that the out of fireflies from to to to the the environment to the environment .
so here are some natural suggestions .
you &apos;d <unk> that you won &apos;t bite . you , you don &apos;t even leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of <unk> like these , but they don &apos;t all of them .
we need need solutions , either one or several of them have have the have for and and for and , and even there are many directions where people are looking at , i really really just five of those of these .
i leave the , , , fusion and and and .
these might afford to do a <unk> , and if you do better than i expect , , but my punch here is that , but my again , here is that we have to be in all of these five , and we can &apos;t have them because all have significant problems .
let &apos;s first look at the burning fossil fuels , burning about either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there , may seem easy , but it &apos;s not . you &apos;d have to go all the co2 that comes from the the , , , , , , , and then they &apos;re <unk> and hope to and hope that it &apos;s .
there are a few of <unk> that that on 60 percent -- 80 percent -- it &apos;s going to get it to 100 percent , it &apos;s going to be a to be a for the of the co2 is a is a great challenge . but the most important thing here is the most important problem here .
who will it make sure ?
who can do something that literally can a lot of of of of of waste than any kind of waste you can can by <unk> and other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so this is a hard word . .
next : <unk> .
it also has three major problems . the costs , especially in countries countries are high . the question that you really feel that you can &apos;t go wrong , despite the human human being that is not used to use weapons .
and what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it &apos;s very large , there &apos;s a lot of thinking .
so three are very difficult problems that perhaps can be soluble , and they are to to work .
the last three of the five five i &apos;ve put together .
it &apos;s the renewables as they &apos;re often .
and also , even -- although it &apos;s great that it &apos;s not a fuel -- they have have some <unk> .
one is the density energy that these technologies are building dramatic than the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you talks about many <unk> , more thousand more than a normal power station .
and , these these these .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all day , it &apos;s not seem to and and , and the the the wind will not move .
so you &apos;ve got to have to go out of these sources , one way , the energy , in the , if you &apos;re not available to get it .
so there &apos;s a big <unk> . . there are challenges in transmission . if we say say that the source source of the country , it &apos;s not just need the technology , they need to be able to the the that that the energy from where different from from different .
and there &apos;s the <unk> . .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve all of of of these batteries that are made : the : the cars , computers , mobile , <unk> , for everything , and i &apos;ve done the the of the the the the that we can make less than 10 minutes of the .
so we need a lot of a breakthrough , something that will be a factor of 100 than than the approaches to time .
this is not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
this is what happens when you try to get these <unk> sources of the , we &apos;ll give you percent percent of the world .
if you want to reach 100 percent on it , they need a incredible <unk> .
now , where are we going to go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
a manhattan project ? how are we going to go ?
what we need a lot of companies that we need to work on .
in each of these five areas we need at least 100 people .
you &apos;re going to say , they &apos;re crazy . that &apos;s fine .
i think there &apos;s a lot of here here here , there are many that are already already there .
bill has has several companies , among other other , called a <unk> <unk> that has great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of dozens of doing great things , and and i try to do this .
nathan myhrvold and i pay pay for a company that perhaps surprisingly , to be the nuclear approach .
there &apos;s some innovations in the <unk> <unk> ; <unk> , liquid . .
but the development has stopped in this industry , a time , , so it &apos;s not a surprise that some some good concepts lying lying around .
the <unk> means that you instead of a part of the <unk> , one percent , the <unk> , , we decided to be the 99 percent , the the the .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been a long time , , but you could never simulate any reasonable thing , it was going to work , but it has a supercomputer , you can simulate it , and see that it &apos;s it &apos;s it &apos;s it &apos;s .
and because you &apos;re that 99 percent of it , it &apos;s a lot better .
in fact , you burn trash , and you can even use waste of today today today .
instead of <unk> it , they burn it , you &apos;ll it . a great thing .
the uranium gets up too , , a a a a a candle .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often as a &quot; speed system &quot; . &quot;
that really really the the .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste that the 99 percent . you have the part that is <unk> , so it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> uranium .
the <unk> u.s. u.s. u.s. to go to hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re <unk> <unk> and and you , you get enough fuel , you have enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of hundreds of of of the we need to come forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
what should we expect to to like ?
now , we go to to to to to we need to achieve , and then we talk about the <unk> .
a lot of 80 percent percent percent percent percent percent .
it &apos;s really really important that we get there .
the rest 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still something more agriculture , hopefully , and hopefully , and and the cement to be clean .
so , to to 80 percent , the developed developed developed countries , including countries like china , their <unk> .
the other grade , whether we use the most technology technology , whether it &apos;s used in all the developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get it to the rest .
that &apos;s important important .
this is a a of of this <unk> .
if we go back from that , how should the 2020 was to to ?
it should be the two two elements .
we should use the <unk> use to get the way to the the the less , the less we &apos;re the the the the and the the and the temperature .
but actually , this note is the thing that we do not completely to the the big <unk> , , , , even less important , the other things that the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs to be .
these breakthroughs are going to to to to <unk> , and we can measure : in <unk> , in <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
there are a lot of great books to this issue .
this al gore book , &quot; we have the choice and david <unk> <unk> the hot air . &quot;
they really go through it and create a a a that can be been about this a wide way that we need for for all of the pages .
there &apos;s a lot of come together .
this is a wish .
a very very , wish that we invent this technology .
if you just me me for the next 50 years , i could pick the president , a a vaccine , a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose this desire , which is is , <unk> , <unk> , i &apos;ll take this wish .
this has the largest impact .
if we get to the wish , the dig in between the term and the short best best people in the u.s. the u.s. the u.s. and china , between the poor and and , and and almost all of these two billion are are very worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what are i going to ? ?
we need to research money for money money .
if countries are in places like <unk> , , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
you &apos;d discuss these <unk> <unk> , and you would be shocked by the ridiculous small of the that these innovative approaches .
we need <unk> , co2 co2 , co2 &amp; amp ; trade &amp; amp ; trade trade .
we have to spread the message .
we have to lead dialogue and full and full and and the things that are being taken from government .
it &apos;s a important wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thanks very much .
bill gates : to do the on on a supercomputer -- all of the big scientists , we have we need need we need need some 10 million , and even if we test our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s reasonable , you &apos;re simply working in the <unk> .
the hard step is building building is the first <unk> , to find another billion , the the , and the the the that it &apos;s the first of it .
as soon as the first thing is , if you were , it &apos;s all , you know , because the economic profit is is as different from the as we know it .
to understand that , to understand that it &apos;s a to building deep in the ground like a vertical <unk> of nuclear <unk> , this this <unk> , and then it starts to the up and and and it &apos;s going to ?
<unk> : right . you you have to have the reactor , , so there &apos;s many people and so many people are going to go go go go go go go go this thing , and you can get it and <unk> and <unk> . it &apos;s not good .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can think of it for 60 60 years -- think of a column -- they immediately , without the the .
and it &apos;s there there and we &apos;re for 60 60 years and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> that allows the to a a the garbage .
<unk> : yeah . now , what happens to the garbage : you can take it -- you can sit it -- there &apos;s much less waste with this method -- then take it and put it into the next reactor and burn it into the next reactor and burn it .
and we start by taking the waste that already exists in these <unk> or or <unk> or the . . this is our <unk> . .
so , this is a problem that this reactors was that we put in our in our and and it will dramatically dramatically in this process .
but as you &apos;ve been talking to different people of the world of the world .
where is the biggest interest , what really do to do ?
<unk> : now we we haven &apos;t yet in a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting <unk> for everything to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; there &apos;s big interest and the people people in people , india , india , and i &apos;ve been talking about this and and i &apos;ve been talking about it , and i &apos;ve been doing this and and i &apos;ve been talking about it
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have made something in the direction .
this is a of of one thing that made done .
this is a important step forward , but it &apos;s like a a of a and and a number of countries built this , so everyone who has already now already now a fast <unk> of a <unk> of our first .
in your mind , , , , and don &apos;t really want to to to life ?
<unk> : now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we &apos;ve spent 20 years and and 20 years .
this is what the deadline that we &apos;ve us the the of of us that we need to follow .
and , you know , <unk> , when everything goes well , and this is a big wish , it might be able to make .
and luckily , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of those , , , , if the work work , work , work for their pilots , work for that .
and it would be best if it could be , because , because you could use a mixture .
in &apos;s case we need a solution .
well , the great kinds of breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important thing .
it would have been without the the , but it &apos;s still much more important .
in nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we know whose work as well as this as this , but there &apos;s a modular technology , which is another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid <unk> of which seems something hard difficult , but maybe it &apos;s saying that &apos;s about us .
and so there are different different , but the beauty of this is that a a a million times a a , a a , a , , , we say , a <unk> , and , and if you can deal with the problems , the the , the the , the the , the the , the the , the the , the the , the the , the the , the the , the the ,
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we have to clean up to try to keep the stable stable ?
<unk> : if you go into this situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;ve too too too much , and just a a heart attack . what do you do ? you need a <unk> or or similar .
there &apos;s a <unk> called called the <unk> that which to to to the to order to <unk> the warming , and to the years to be able to give us .
this is just a <unk> . .
you hope you don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t even work work insurance because you might be a simple , you can move , because because you know that you know that you will save the <unk> .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , you you &apos;re the importance of this problem of eyes , but there &apos;s a a of of in in if you should have to have to come , , , that innovation innovation takes a little bit , or that innovation innovation takes .
<unk> : have you have two sentences for you to to you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptic &apos;s in very different camps .
those who are doing the scientific case , are very little .
tell you that there are negative effects that have the to do the clouds of the clouds ?
there are very , very few things that you can say , you can there a chance in a million .
this is what &apos;s like like like aids .
you &apos;re making mistakes now , and you pay for a lot later .
and so the idea of the idea , now , if you &apos;ve all kinds of problems in in something that you only got to be -- and and come to the investment , and , in fact , the the is not necessarily the the , , and the the is not necessarily the most of the , and the the , , the the , which is not necessarily the most of the , and you
the fact is that this uncertainty should worry about .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economically , and then the co2 the co2 , the the , the , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested in that it &apos;s not that it &apos;s not much much , because it &apos;s cheaper to do it , because it &apos;s cheaper to do it , because it &apos;s cheaper to do it , because it &apos;s cheaper to do it , because it
and that would be the response to the <unk> argument that if you &apos;ve all all this time and energy and energy to solve the amount of the , , all the other goals , the the , , the , , , to invest in the , , and it &apos;s better things that we can do for the , and to work for the , , and it &apos;s better things that we do for for
<unk> : well , the actual spending spending the research -- -- say , the u.s. each year will spend more than than today -- that &apos;s not quite dramatic .
below others , not suffer from others .
you then you can <unk> , and you can can <unk> people people disagree if you have something that is not economically , and tried to fund that , for me , for me &apos;s most of to take most of .
well , you &apos;re , you &apos;re just a a <unk> , and you &apos;re also funded the learning learning , and i think we should try to try more things that have the potential to be much much .
if you get the <unk> that you get a very high <unk> , , then you can can &apos;t get the rich .
i mean , each one of us could spend five times much for our energy without his lifestyle .
but it &apos;s a a bottom of the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> think about .
and his new <unk> is now , &quot; why is &apos;t that be talking about research ? &quot;
it &apos;s still still , because of his former stories , associated with the <unk> , but he understood that that &apos;s a very lonely group , and therefore &apos;s why it &apos;s the the <unk> .
and this is a thought that i think is appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy how little that is being supported .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about all people here , i hope hope hope that &apos;s true , you know , thank you . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago , at ted , peter <unk> <unk> a <unk> called &quot; the &quot; . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . <unk> , the have to <unk> the large <unk> structure with 20 spaghetti , about three , , about feet , through a <unk> , and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow must be up on top .
and , although it really seems really , it &apos;s really hard difficult difficult , because it &apos;s very to work very quickly .
and so i thought this this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a <unk> . .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve been about 70 workshops of the world students students , the and architects and architects even with the <unk> of the , and there &apos;s something to the that that might be able to provide the most of , and i want to share some of of it with you .
usually , most people people people to the to the .
you talk about it , it &apos;s going to look like it &apos;s going to be it .
then they invest a little time in planning and organization , they actually drawing and and they . .
they spend a lot of time in the <unk> <unk> the the .
and finally , before you don &apos;t have time time , take take the marshmallow and you put it down at the top , step back , step back and &quot; &quot; ; admire your work .
but what &apos;s almost always happened , is that the &quot; <unk> &quot; is &quot; to a &quot; <unk> , &quot; because the weight of the <unk> is that the whole thing thing thing thing and and the .
there &apos;s a number of people who have much more &quot; <unk> &quot; than others , and and under the worst are absolutely <unk> .
they lie they they they they &apos;re confused and produce <unk> , and produce .
and of course there are also teams that have more &quot; <unk> , and and the best &apos;s the best &apos;s fresh schools of the .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as of us , , don &apos;t just make the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you &apos;re going to be is how is this ? why ? what about those ?
and peter peter , &quot; neither of the children children do the the of of spaghetti . . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest in in <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that that , that <unk> were trained to find a right plan , ok !
and then it .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time more and what what ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar familiar , what ?
what &apos;s is is that is that they begin with the marshmallow , build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow on the top , so that they had <unk> the opportunity to repair a prototype .
<unk> , this kind of collaboration is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
and with every , , the kids have immediately all of feedback , what doesn &apos;t work .
so the performance that work with prototypes , , , but , but let &apos;s see how different people are .
the average for most of the most is about about half of the , half of the , , more , , but not much , more than than adults .
who is most most successful ?
architects and engineers , the happiness .
now , meter is the highest thing i saw .
and why ? because they understand triangles and <unk> and the the of the key to build stable structures .
ceos are about average , but it &apos;s interesting .
you you an <unk> at at the team , they become significant better .
it &apos;s unbelievable . you can see , and see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict that . why is it ? ?
because they have special skills of <unk> .
they lead the process , you understand it .
and the team that will fall back and the work is going to notice the the of the power of the power .
these sorts of skills and <unk> and and and to succeed .
if you have 10 teams , the typical , you get about six , that have stable structures .
i tried to just an interesting interesting .
i thought , we the the the the .
so i offered a <unk> <unk> price of the .
what do you think about these <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a lot of structure .
if anyone had a <unk> <unk> in , he would have been the price home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high high school have a strong effect ?
we went through this this with a same . .
now , what did you think ?
now they understand the advantage of prototyping .
so &apos;s how same same same , the the team of a under the best .
they produced the highest construction of the least time .
there are a <unk> lessons for us , nature nature and and .
you may ask , why would somebody actually get to create a a ? ?
the reason is , i &apos;m going to help digital tools and processes to help teams help teams , games games and &quot; <unk> <unk>
and what the <unk> is is , it helps you to identify the assumptions .
because , , , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a shared experience , a common language , a a language of the , and the the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this this this this this this .
and those of you who are interested in , can visit <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build the the .
there &apos;s a <unk> of there .
you find a here here , the world , people people people people the system and and .
there &apos;s also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson lesson , i think is that this is actually a <unk> sport .
it requires that we we all of our senses to the to and that we we our our think as as our feelings and our our , in the challenge that we are .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience of this experience , it needs us to put a &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; moment . &quot; moment . &quot;
and that can make a difference .
thank you .
we &apos;s what we we like we have a machine .
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everybody in this room has to be in .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; they cannot stay in here and right now .
and i wonder what they would choose because i &apos;m going to my friends in the last time , and they wanted to go all the the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to time before there was cars or twitter or &quot; &quot; america &apos;s addiction . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i believe believe that you &apos;re sort of <unk> to <unk> to <unk> .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i was a .
it &apos;s because that the planet doesn &apos;t go back to this planet , go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest greatest time that ever ever on on this planet , no matter , they can take , health , wealth , wealth , mobility , , and declining .
there was never been time time like this .
my favorite <unk> died they were 60 60 .
my grandparents would me me that number .
my parents are the 80 on the <unk> .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a larger than that .
a child who is born in new delhi today , expect to live as much as the richest man in the world in the world .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox : smallpox smallpox billion people on this planet .
you &apos;ve got the demographics in the way in a way that it &apos;s not a war ever .
they are gone . they are gone .
we have them <unk> . .
in the rich world exist exist , the millions of us have have a of us , still have still have .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
does anyone know what this is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are the successes of the scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try to look at this , if it works , it it works , if it doesn &apos;t do , , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , it &apos;s all the good news , because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people in the world every day every day hungry every day .
it &apos;s up , and it &apos;s very fast , and it &apos;s a embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve also also the imagination to make this world very .
drinking , , , , rainforests , oil , gas , they disappear , and , and , and if we don &apos;t go out of this chaos , we we we we we we we we we we disappear .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think it .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed the billions of people without the country , to rape .
i think we can power this world with energy that that they don &apos;t .
i really believe that , and no , this is not a <unk> .
but this is me me at at one one of the things that you me at at night -- we haven &apos;t have much more progress like now , never , never , .
and we &apos;ve never been able to make it perfectly <unk> , as we can do it today .
we &apos;re at the threshold of amazing , amazing events on many lot , and yet , i really think that we &apos;ve hundreds hundreds of years back to the to to find a time that we have <unk> about these things , we we about these things more more , more called more called .
people are itself their their , and so so so that you can &apos;t free it .
not even the truth is going to free .
and listen , everybody has a right to his opinion , even a a right to his opinion .
but you know , what don &apos;t &apos;t you have right right ?
they don &apos;t really have their own facts . &apos; <unk> , don &apos;t have .
and i took a while to find that .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about <unk> for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed to <unk> resistance on resistance on the , of the the the the the most effective activity in the health care in the history of humanity .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i did what i do , i i was writing , wrote wrote an article and driving .
and soon i was wrote an article about genetically genetically .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were played crazy .
so i also have written an article about it , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be , &quot; &quot; , &quot; why you thought that molecules is a certain particular kind of a , a kind of a <unk> of of nature
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i wrote on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we type , we &apos;re going to eat , , &apos;s okay .
but this article made me worried , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and , and i found it out .
and that &apos;s because these were those who were just crazy , were were not just just .
these were <unk> people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like people people in this room .
and that brought me up up like this .
but then i thought , you know know what , let &apos;s be . .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as the same time .
we talk about it .
we &apos;re ironic about the little quote , &quot; &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , so there &apos;s reasons , and i think know what what the reasons .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and and there &apos;s no reason why that &apos;s not not be that way .
you can just call a some name and and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , mass destruction , the <unk> of 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we thought that they were always . be . . so be skeptical .
ask ask ask , desire , desire , desire .
take nothing for me .
but now it &apos;s : if you get evidence evidence , and it &apos;s not that evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can say that that &apos;s the reason that we live in an epidemic of fear of fear as i &apos;ve never seen , and i never never see .
about 12 years ago , a story published a a , a terrible story that the the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> vaccine .
very frightening .
<unk> studies have been done to see if that was true .
a lot of studies studies be done ; this is a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in in the u.s. , in england , from sweden , from of canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection . no connection .
it doesn &apos;t matter difference . it doesn &apos;t make difference difference , because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see what we see what what we believe is that we feel feel
we don &apos;t believe in a <unk> of of a <unk> , data data , and i understand that , i think that &apos;s what we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that was <unk> .
<unk> because of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the <unk> is goes down for . .
this is <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s awful .
what &apos;s what happens that we could do this .
well , i understand that . i do .
because here &apos;s two ?
did one single one in the the of die ?
not often doesn &apos;t happen .
in this country , not at all , but it &apos;s for the in the last year .
these are a lot of deaths by , 20 per hour .
but because this is not happening here , we can see it , and people like jenny and people can be walk around and and and and and of those are <unk> and and <unk> and , and larry king king &apos;s on .
and you can do that because they can &apos;t connect cause and correlation .
you don &apos;t understand that these seem to be the same , but almost never the same thing .
and that &apos;s something that we need to learn , and very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , ! !
the the in the in the middle not that way .
it &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he &apos;s evolved with a few other people .
he can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
well , that &apos;s good , aside paul &apos;s on on vaccines and talk about vaccines and how valuable they are , and that people should be to to .
and that &apos;s what he &apos;s like .
so paul is a terrorist .
when paul talks talks in a public <unk> , he can &apos;t tell the <unk> <unk> .
he gets to phone home home because people like to tell him that you know where your children are going to school .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
you you on , they &apos;re going to go back diseases , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
we have <unk> .
and this is going worse , and pretty soon , kids will die back to it , because that &apos;s just one question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just dying dying .
what about the ? ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
and i wrote a <unk> of me a few weeks ago , and i said , i think i &apos;m a little bit to <unk> .
nobody has ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t get their child against against <unk> .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have any <unk> . and you know what ?
we had no <unk> in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe morning morning , she got in in lagos in an airplane and flies in the , , at the moment he &apos;s over ohio .
and in a few hours , it ends up and a car , and it &apos;s come back to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these <unk> <unk> tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that it &apos;s infected with a a disease , and we don &apos;t know that because it &apos;s how the world is now .
this is the planet that we live in . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
we love to keep the in lies . we love that .
do you have taken this this morning ?
<unk> , a little <unk> that that you &apos;re going to .
i know that you did this because half of americans americans do it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference how often we find out that they &apos;re useless
the data is constantly the .
they make their urine . more do you almost never .
that &apos;s okay , you want to pay like 28 to dollars dark urine .
i &apos;m to to to you .
dark urine . dark .
why why do we do that ? why are we doing this ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the &apos;s drug industry .
we hate to government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t do that . our healthcare system is missing .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing amazing and and to to us that can afford .
so we &apos;re going away , and where where are we going to go ?
we &apos;re walking into the arms of <unk> .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is a serious serious issue , because stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
and i have all sorts of small go . .
none of it -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , even , , , i don &apos;t even know what this is , but we give billions of billions of it it &apos;s
and you know what ? if i say that , me , people me me , and people , &quot; what do you take ? let &apos;s do it ? do you want to do what they want .
so &apos;s how you feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s the <unk> , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not suppose the evidence of my experts , &quot; or any <unk> , who want to treat his patients with <unk> .
if you &apos;re to to go to that way where believe and magic evidence and magic evidence , replace , and they get to a place where they don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he brought 400,000 400,000 of his people because he he had the red red , , <unk> and more more than a drugs are are are that we know that they know that they can the the of aids .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country that worse than any other of this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these don &apos;t have consequences .
they have they they always .
now , the <unk> epidemic that we &apos;re in in is this is the about the <unk> genetically genetically genetically <unk> and and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words about metaphor .
this is ideology , not science .
all we eat , every every , every stick , , every branch , , was changed by people .
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
there was no <unk> . .
there was no <unk> . we we did it .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of it works and some of it doesn &apos;t work .
we got rid of what &apos;s not work .
now we can actually it . and of course , there are risks . but we can do something like vitamin a or or , , and can help millions of people people to to them .
you don &apos;t want to do it ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t .
we <unk> <unk> we really really .
why do we do that ?
now , what i hear hear is to do is many many chemicals , pesticides , pesticides , hormones , we don &apos;t want to go up with huge fields with a thing that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want to patent companies .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
and you know what my answer is all of this ?
yes , you &apos;re right . fix this .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but it &apos;s not science .
it has nothing to do .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; she &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work , because we afraid afraid is a <unk> , and it &apos;s millions of people from flourish .
you know , in the next 50 years , we will going to grow 70 percent more food than the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? it &apos;s really really .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff like <unk> .
<unk> is something that &apos;s a half a billion people food .
it &apos;s about like like potato .
it &apos;s just a <unk> calories . it &apos;s <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are building all of this .
and then people might eat the food and wouldn &apos;t become blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starvation , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and everything i can say is is : why do we fight ?
i mean , ask : why do we fight that ?
because we don &apos;t want genes to ?
it &apos;s not about genes , it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our hold on food food , better food , better food .
it &apos;s not about about <unk> , it &apos;s about about people alive , and it &apos;s going to be time to understand understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do it on how far we we do about something about something that we , i think , not &apos;t want to be guilty , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what what happens .
it &apos;s selfish ; it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy , and we don &apos;t have to to it .
so after that incredibly funny funny , you you might want to say , &quot; you want to go back to that that is , &quot; you you going to go back to this ridiculous machine and
anyway , i want it . i want to .
right now , in the moment , you have an an opportunity .
we can go this back machine , we can we want to .
we can <unk> them , where we we to to go them , and we will going to move them to go where we want .
we need to lead this conversations , and we need to think , but when we go back to the time back to the future , we will going to be happy to have that .
i know that can , and as it as it &apos;s , it &apos;s something that &apos;s a thing that needs to be .
thank you .
thank you .
now , &apos;ve been interested in the <unk> . . it may seem strange to be that a a interested in , because , you look at it as , as a as a being , , if somebody &apos;s only really enough to do . &quot;
in other words , <unk> have in some been a an been in a a that that &apos;s only that , because because the person thinks thinking about what is happening with , or a a , or a , , , , , , , the patient is only really , in the body , , for example ,
one is a real real real real because because someone is how it it .
so we we to to understand other , , i want to show you an basic , very , interesting trick .
and i &apos;ll show you how it works . this is a trick that &apos;s been at least at least for the the for the children .
i i &apos;ve learned it from the <unk> magic magic of the in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain explain why i explain it .
so , you see what happens .
the knife you can study ; ; my hand can study .
i &apos;m going to keep the knife just so in my hand .
i push my my .
and to make sure that nothing is nothing in my end of your vote , out of him , i &apos;ll just just your wrist .
in this way , you can see that that &apos;s &apos;t move anything . long as i can <unk> here , there can &apos;t be any of my .
and the goal is easy to deal with it .
i &apos;m open up my hand , hopefully , if everything goes fine , the knife is <unk> by my naked physical magnetism .
it &apos;s actually in that in his place that i can shake it without without the knife .
nothing happens to in my sleeves or come , no <unk> , and you can study it .
<unk> !
now , this is a trick that i often young kids young children that i &apos;m useful to magic , because you can learn a lot about deception , even if you look closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple <unk> trick
probably many of you know , many of you here in this trick .
it works way .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say that i my wrist , to make sure that nothing is anything in my your or out there , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason why i put my wrist is is that that that is the real secret of illusion .
because , in the moment , i my hand of you , you you you you , you can move out of this , , this finger , , just from where he was , where he was so his .
great trick ?
there &apos;s someone else else who who had had childhood .
so , it &apos;s here . right .
and when i <unk> , , it &apos;s its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception why you don &apos;t realizing that there are only three finger : because the mind and the way that he &apos;s information information , not only one , two , three , three , three , three , three
but that &apos;s what it &apos;s &apos;t really all about here , and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s held in , but not by magnetism of my body , but by a trick , through my <unk> , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same is the same by by by this movement , that &apos;s moving back to .
i take this hand . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick you can demonstrate your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does that to do with the ? ?
a year ago , or one year , i read a study that really got really true .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and so that was that was an amazing thing to me .
and what it turns out is : if you offer a placebo against a white pill in the form of a <unk> , , is it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a a a a that
but if you &apos;re the shape that you &apos;re going to pick up a &apos;s for , , in a little pill , and this blue color and and that you can that that you can actually is it it
and that , although no of of any of these -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as good as a girl &apos;s blue pill .
what ? that really me me crazy .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
if you &apos;re infinitely more more more more more more more more than every form .
an colored capsule that which is at one yellow and the the other , is better than a white capsule .
the the is plays a role .
a pill a day a day , not as well as three pills -- i can remember the think about the exact same statistic . sorry &apos;m sorry .
but the &apos;s the , , ...
that that the <unk> play a role .
and the shape is a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate ultimate <unk> , you have to reach the needle .
right ? one syringe with a <unk> -- a a of a <unk> substance that you &apos;re to to a .
that &apos;s a very strong image in the head . it &apos;s much more much more than a white pill .
this graph is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another one time when we have a it .
so fact fact that the white white is not as well as the the the the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as an capsule that are not as good as what the the needle .
and none of this has really really <unk> property . it &apos;s just our belief that we in us a greater impact .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;ll take a bit , obviously , a is a be a and it look look it real .
and we know from that study that you have to reach out for a needle when it should to go to the .
this is a 18 inches in a long time . it &apos;s very , very , , and i &apos;m going to do it a little bit of a little bit .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not special special special meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to leave this needle into my skin and and through through through it , it it it up on the other side .
if you &apos;re them , if you go off -- -- i i a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some some people i didn &apos;t know , and it &apos;s become a .
so i propose to you if you &apos;re quickly , , you look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the the first sensitive part here .
you can see it in the same , you can also be <unk> if you want .
so , it &apos;s , right here , where my meat is , the bottom part of my arm , i just just a little <unk> .
sorry , i do it . do it crazy ?
and just just a little bit of my skin and and on the other side .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation we had the the .
about about .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;ll show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah , yeah , yeah .
i know what people people think when you see that .
they say , &quot; okay , who &apos;s not so stupid and <unk> , the skin , just to talk for us for a few minutes .
well , i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people people back back , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see that right . &quot;
people are coming in in the <unk> .
let me just tell you out of that .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can do the <unk> .
sorry , i . when you &apos;re out , look , look , look , look .
the people the back , the the way later , at point point , , , say , &quot; well , well , this is quite impressive , but if it really was really , , it &apos;s a hole , it &apos;s a hole , it would be . &quot;
okay , let me just a little bit of blood for you .
yeah , here &apos;s it .
now usually i would take the this to out now .
i would clean clean my arm and show you that there are a .
but i think in this frame here and with the intention of a deception , i &apos;m going to make the needle just there and and i the the .
we &apos;re going to a few a few times .
i hope you you know , you you . thank you .
any talk today about happiness today .
i &apos;ve got some people the number of books that have been in &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they gave about 40 40 years , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness under researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these <unk> of of work , there are several cognitive cognitive that it &apos;s sort of almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly about those cognitive cognitive ones .
it &apos;s true for <unk> that which you &apos;re about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true to scientists , which is that you know , because it turns out that are exactly as as as anyone else .
the first one of those fall is a <unk> , to admit .
it turns out that the word just simply doesn &apos;t just a useful word more , because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s one particular importance that we could it it , but in the whole thing that we need to give up , and we will going to give up the complicated to think , and we will going to take to to what well-being is .
the second case is a experience of experience , memory -- basically basically , you &apos;re happy between his life and happy his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> of of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that is the miserable fact that we cannot &apos;t think about a fact that we can not to to its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive case .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a <unk> of of one of my lectures , one of the <unk> , he said he he had a a symphony , and it was absolutely glorious music , and it was absolutely glorious music , and it was absolutely glorious music , and it was absolutely glorious music ,
and then he added it , really quite emotional , which is the entire experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it was had had the experience of experience .
he had had experience .
he had had 20 <unk> music for .
they don &apos;t cook because he was a memory memory , he was ruined , and the memory was anything he had to get .
what what really tells us is that we could think about about about other people , and the sense of two species of self .
there &apos;s a <unk> self that &apos;s in the present and the present present , , is able to experience the past , but basically the the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> self that the doctor <unk> -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; it &apos;s going to watch it , i i you you ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the <unk> self is that the <unk> and the history of our life , and it &apos;s one that the doctor saying to the the question : &quot; how did you feel the the time ? &quot;
or , &quot; how did your journey to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the <unk> self and the self and the the two , and the two is part of the <unk> of happiness .
now , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we &apos;re not just tell stories , if we make to tell stories about .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we &apos;re our ourselves ourselves our own ourselves .
and let &apos;s take a a one example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real real patients that are actually interested in the painful procedure .
i will not go into detail . it &apos;s not painful , but it was painful , but she was painful when this trial was was in the 1990s .
they were asked to to all 60 seconds to report .
and here are two patients . these are your records .
and they &apos;ll ask , &quot; who &apos;s have been suffered more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has a suffered . his <unk> was longer longer , and every minute of pain had had had a patient had a patient patient , and more .
but now there &apos;s a question : &quot; how much did this patient have to have to have . &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a a much worse <unk> to the the field of the as a patient patient b.
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story , how it ends up .
and none of these stories are very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is worse than the other .
and the , the worse is the where the pain is at at the end of his at his peak . it &apos;s a very bad story .
how do we know this ?
because we asked these people to their <unk> , , and also much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a b for a b in the .
now , this is a direct direct conflict between the <unk> itself and the <unk> itself .
from the point of view , , , had a worse worse time .
now , what you could do with patient patient , and we actually did actually trials experiments , and it &apos;s made , and it &apos;s made , you could actually do the the the patient by by by just to the the way to to to to .
this is going to be the patient &apos;s patient is only a bit less than before .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you you have the the <unk> of a worse at a worse , and you have to that the the the the patient is a much better better because because now you &apos;ve given a better story about his experience .
what are a a story ?
and that is true of the stories that makes you and it &apos;s true for the stories that we invent .
so a a story of <unk> are in , and moments and .
end up , very , very important , and in this case , the end .
now , the <unk> itself lives life life .
it &apos;s have times of the <unk> , one after one .
and you ask , what what &apos;s going on these moments ?
and the answer is really easy . they lost lost forever .
i mean , most bunch of our lives -- and i think that -- you know , the psychological present may be about about three seconds , which means you know , you know , in life in a life , in a month , in a month , most of them don &apos;t leave them .
most of you are completely ignored by the <unk> itself .
and yet they somehow get the impression that they should count , that what &apos;s happening on this moments of the life is our lives .
it &apos;s a limited resource that we use use as we use in the world .
and as we use it , seem seem seem important , but that &apos;s not the story that will keep the the the the itself .
so we have the <unk> self and the self itself , and they &apos;re really pretty different .
the the difference between you is the time .
from the point of view of the , if you have a vacation and the second second the the the the the the first , the first one is the <unk> <unk> twice as well as the <unk> .
that &apos;s how it doesn &apos;t work at the for the .
for the <unk> , , a a <unk> better better on on the vacation because because because there &apos;s no new memories .
they didn &apos;t changed the story .
and in this way , is time , the critical variable that is different from a <unk> itself , a <unk> itself , time , has very little impact on this story .
now , the <unk> self makes more than remember and tell stories .
it &apos;s actually that one that is the , because if you have a patient , who , , we had two two two two of in the , and to choose what he &apos;s choose , then , that &apos;s the , that &apos;s the , the , which is the the , which is the the , which is the the ,
the <unk> self doesn &apos;t have voice in this choice .
actually , we don &apos;t choose to be . we choose the experiences between experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of the future .
we think about our future as a <unk> memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a <unk> of the <unk> , and you can think of the most powerful self as one , which sort of <unk> the <unk> self of the <unk> that doesn &apos;t need it .
i have the impression that if we &apos;re going on vacation , that &apos;s very much case , means we &apos;re going to go on on on on the services in the services of the .
and this is a little bit of justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we we from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that the the of the <unk> .
and when i think about it , i think think of a vacation that we &apos;ve taken in antarctica , the best one had the best vacation i had ever had , and i think in in the relationship with how often i think about other other .
and i probably have to my memories of my memories of this <unk> journey , i &apos;d say about about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i ever had the folder that has had 600 images in the of the time i &apos;ve been spent hour .
now , these are three three weeks , and it &apos;s only an hour and hours .
there seems to be a . .
now , i like a little extremely extremely , you know , how little appetite i have in the <unk> of memories , but even if you &apos;re more of them , , why why give you so much weight in the the weight of the weight that we &apos;re what we &apos;re are are .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next vacation , you know that at the end of the <unk> , all of their pictures , and you get out of a drug , so you &apos;re not remember .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you think of another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between their two species of self and you have to think about how to decide this conflict , and that &apos;s really not pretty obvious , because if you think of the sense of time , and if you think of you , you , you you a different answer . and if you think of you in
why we pick the the of that we pick is a problem that makes us a a choice between the two species of self .
now , two species of self throw two two concepts of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of the happiness that we can apply to , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the <unk> self ?
and then you &apos;d ask : how happy are the moments in life of the life ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and by the way , we &apos;re able to do a pretty good idea of the the of the the time of the .
if you &apos;re the the of the the , , it &apos;s a different thing .
this is not about how happy life is alive .
it &apos;s about how happy or not that is if that person is about their life .
very &apos;s very different term .
everybody who &apos;s not not different of those concepts are going to up to happiness , and i &apos;m one of of the researchers that have been learning about this of of of that , that this kind of this .
the distinction between the between the the and and and happiness even is been realized in the last last years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two of .
the the a has has a global survey , where more than half a million people people are been asking about about what you think about your and and their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started to learn about two ways of the .
and the main lesson that we think i think is learned learned that they really are different .
you can know how you are with his life , and that doesn &apos;t really really about how happy he lives lives , how he lives lives .
and just to give you a sense of correlation , correlation that correlation is about <unk> .
what what that means is that if you would meet somebody and you would tell you , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about the size ?
now , you would know about about the big , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone &apos;s his life as eight on eight of 10 of 10 of , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his <unk> .
so correlation is low .
we know something about what happiness is is .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know happiness is mostly to be satisfied with people people we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s a dominant .
so if you &apos;re lucky to maximize the two species of even , they &apos;re going to do the end of the .
the conclusion that i &apos;ve said here is is that we really should not really think of happiness for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , a very short , another reason , we don &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things if we &apos;re thinking about life and when we actually
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , they &apos;re not going to get the correct answer .
if you think that question question you think that people are going to be happier , if you &apos;re going to say , in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference , we say , climate . climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the <unk> itself , and it &apos;s not even important for the <unk> self that decides how happy people are .
but , because the the is responsible for , you can end up -- some people people the end to the end .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to to what what happens to people who are going to to california , to be happier .
well , your <unk> itself will not be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier because if you &apos;re going to remember you about it , how terrible was in ohio in ohio , and they &apos;ll feel that you have the the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope , i hope you you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you .
now , when we saw the phone of a couple of weeks ago , she told me that it was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this place .
is that something that can make us in because they have now have a couple minutes now ?
daniel <unk> : safe .
i think the most interesting thing that we found in the gallup poll is a number that we had not to find .
we found that in the terms of the <unk> .
if we were looking at the way that vary those feelings that vary . income .
and it turns out that a income $ income dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very big position of americans americans , , , , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , a income per year per year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they are more less less less less less they they they become .
we get this is where we get a flat line line .
i mean , i rarely saw so flat lines .
what happens is obvious that money is not a one of the one , , , but that lack of money on a a misery , and we can get this misery , very clear .
in the sense of the other , the the itself , they get a different story .
the more money you tend to be happier is you .
it &apos;s not not for emotions .
but danny , in the entire of the is about , freedom , to happiness .
when people would take this <unk> seriously , i mean , it seems to to everything to your mind , everything that we think , like , for example , in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there a chance that politicians that that the country to be a a <unk> like seriously , and to politics ?
<unk> : you know , i believe believe that there &apos;s recognition to the role of the role in politics .
the recognition will going to be slowly in the united states , but in the united states , but in the united has happened , they &apos;re happening in other countries .
people are thinking about you , you should think about happiness when you think about politics .
it will take a while , and people will argue whether they &apos;re to explore , or they want to explore , or they want to explore , , so we need to have to have this discussion quite soon .
as you can happiness , very different to to how you think about how they think and whether they think about the <unk> self , whether they think about the <unk> self .
that &apos;s going politics change politics , i think in the the years .
in the united states , you &apos;re to to measure the <unk> of the population .
that &apos;s going to be , in the next one , two decades , or two decades , the national statistic .
now , it seems to me , this is going to be the the most interesting political political the most interesting political debate about the the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thanks , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal , i &apos;re making video video games .
now i &apos;ve been building for for 10 years , and my my goal for next decade , and it &apos;s easy to to make the the world in reality , to save the world in the in the .
i have a plan for it . i want to convince more people , including them all of time playing playing more and more .
but currently we spend 3 billion hours a week .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a lot of games . &quot;
maybe a much time when we think about how many problems we have in the real world .
but in fact , my research on the research the future is actually to the the opposite of the .
three billion hours a week , they &apos;re not nearly enough to solve the most &apos;s problems .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century century on this planet , we have to increase this time .
i i that that that time time time time time morning time , time morning time , time per per per week .
maybe it seems to be a little bit more , , so so i repeat it , so that if we can do problems like like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , and i think , , we &apos;re going to try to games at least 21 billion hours a week , the the .
no , i really really really .
why ? this image describes quite why i think that games is such a critical for for survival survival in the the .
this is a portrait portrait named phil phil <unk> .
he wanted to capture the feelings playing playing , so he &apos;s got a a on the players .
this is one of the classic things play playing .
if you &apos;re not a players , you may some of the nuances in this image .
you &apos;re probably see that sense of urgency , something fear , but also also very possible concentration , quite a very , , a fairly difficult problem .
if you play play , you can see some of there , there are <unk> eyes , and the mouth are a sign of optimism . the the &apos;s the the .
this is a player that &apos;s on the edge of a so-called <unk> .
oh , you know that . ok . so we have some some of here .
a a victory is a result that is so pretty positive that they didn &apos;t even know that it was possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you reach it , you &apos;re shocked to get that in this way . this is a <unk> victory .
this player stands for a a a a victory .
and this is what we need to see millions of faces of <unk> around the world , if we take the the the the the the the next century , the face of people who are on the the of of the the edge of a <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re more of this face in real life when we &apos;re hard to face .
i call it it as &quot; in life &quot; in life , &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? ok ? ok ?
that &apos;s me , i am i do in life , &quot; i &apos;m doing bad &quot;
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i was in my ph.d. , , we &apos;re better in play in in real life .
this is a problem that have a lot of players .
we think we don &apos;t think as as good as well as play .
and i don &apos;t just succeed that that that that it &apos;s .
we reach into more <unk> . i mean , in the context of motivation with motivation , to do something to do with the collaboration .
if we &apos;re in a <unk> , , i think many of us , our best version of us , our best version , , and time and immediately , are to to to to the the problem , as much as it takes to to the the .
and in reality , if we fail to break down on obstacles , we feel often feel differently .
we feel overwhelmed . we &apos;re so defeated . we &apos;re threatened us , we feel threatened by us , perhaps depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
these are the emotions we never play play play games , don &apos;t play it .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study at graduate student .
why is it impossible to play , to think , you , you could not do anything ?
how can we put those feelings out of play in reality ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , which is the ideal of of the .
and i realized some things that the the that that in in <unk> .
so , first , if you get into one of these <unk> , , in world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters who are willing to give you a <unk> mission of <unk> , and immediately .
but not only any mission , but a mission that &apos;s a mission to fit perfect to the current level , right ?
so they do it .
you never never get a job that you can &apos;t solve .
but always on the the of your skills , so you have a huge , but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you don &apos;t sit around and and <unk> . there &apos;s always something easy to do .
and there are plenty of staff .
where you go go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to end their mission mission .
we don &apos;t have in real life in real life , that feeling that that a a of of of of in a of of .
and also , this idea of this idea , this inspiring story , why we are there and what we &apos;re doing .
and then we get this whole feedback feedback .
they &apos;ve &apos;ve been up from &quot; level and &quot; + &quot; or &quot; + or &quot; + $ .
this constant feedback is not in real life .
if i leave that stage , i didn &apos;t have a + + or a a a a idea , + 20 -- no .
i get in real life in the feedback .
so , the problem of of of is of warcraft is that it &apos;s as satisfying , to be on on the edge of a <unk> that that we &apos;d rather spend all our time in these <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
to this , all the world of <unk> together spent a million of of years to solve the virtual problems of <unk> .
this is not necessarily something bad .
it may be bad .
but to look at it in the context , in the context , we started to go to the <unk> million years ago .
so the first run a .
ok , so if we talk about about how much time we spend currently play with play , it &apos;s just makes sense when you &apos;re in terms of the human development of the human development of what &apos;s extraordinarily .
but too too . because it turns out that we use using this whole time , play , in fact , that change , we &apos;re as people as people are in the .
we &apos;re developing world world , you will be extremely .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe .
now , look at this interesting statistics that recently published from a researcher of carnegie mellon university : the average young man was in a country with huge <unk> of of with with <unk> to the 21st of of hours with the 21st of
so , 10,000 hours a is an interesting number , for reasons .
first , for children in the united states , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that they spend in the school , from the high school , the high school school -- if you don &apos;t have missing .
so we &apos;ve got a full entire <unk> of , in the young people learn how to do it means to be a good player , how anything else you learn in school school .
and maybe some of you have the new book by malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> . read .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the &apos;s of of hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research research on the , that if we spend 10,000 hours of a <unk> to the the of of any normal to the 21st of age , we will to master it .
we &apos;re going to do as good as whatever the most most most important people of the world .
so what we &apos;ve here is a whole whole of young people who are the <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what is &apos;s pretty good ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we &apos;d never have have the potential human potential .
so many people have now in the world that at least an hour per day with <unk> .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people who are extraordinary good at &quot; . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players that extraordinary &apos;s extraordinary good in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet ,
the <unk> <unk> <unk> that save energy and save energy , instead of the , instead of the <unk> , so that players around the world , especially in india , brazil , brazil ,
you expect one extra billion player in the next decade .
so we we have a billion billion players .
so i started to think about what it is , what &apos;s what they &apos;re doing to do these games .
here here are the four things i found . first : <unk> .
ok , imagine that &apos;s like extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do something to do something , a a a a , together , we think that we have a american hope to succeed .
remember remember remember that a more victory is possible , and it &apos;s worth worth worth trying to try and it &apos;s the same .
i don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in the spiders and social nets .
there are a lot of interesting interesting studies that show that we might like to like we &apos;ve played with them , even when they &apos;ve gotten us .
the reason why it is that it requires a lot of trust to play with a game .
we trust trust that someone who spend time with us that the rules will going to be the the the same goal and to to the to the the .
so , the <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> , trust and trust .
as a consequence of that , we build stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of of 22 22 a per week , a , kind of a .
the reason is that if we &apos;re play , we &apos;re actually going to work hard to work when we &apos;re not , if we &apos;re not , or nothing .
we know that we as human beings , we work hard when we do hard , work work .
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the right task .
and ultimately , , , , .
players like to love to be part of awe the the mission of .
here &apos;s a <unk> <unk> to to the the to the the rights ; you know , all all wikipedia , the largest &apos;s largest wiki in the
the second largest wiki in the world , with nearly 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people are using it every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft on the internet as being about any other of in every other of the world .
they create an moving story .
they create a a source source of of of warcraft .
ok , so that &apos;s four superpowers that lead to a single result . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
these are people who believe that as a single world can change the world .
and the only problem is that you believe you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
this is the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> . .
his work is awesome . he studied why why people people so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we will going to be witnesses of a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and this is a an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not as i as i can do i develop , i &apos;m a little bit .
so he says that that actually makes sense , because players can achieve more than in in the real life .
they can make more powerful in greater greater social ties as the real life . they get more feedback and and into play in play in the real life .
so he says it &apos;s completely logical that that players more time in virtual world in the real world .
i just only to , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not a <unk> .
we need to start to turn the world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event , for 2,500 years of <unk> .
there are these ancient cube , from <unk> you know ?
in was <unk> <unk> .
and these were sort of the first first of people people .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the the of the ancient greek <unk> , maybe you may be that story . the story about how and why it &apos;s invented .
according to the <unk> , games were games , <unk> , in the kingdom of a a .
he was supposed to be a big famine that that the king of <unk> to to a crazy idea .
people people people . people . .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and a national strategy . one day , you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so much into the <unk> , because games are so fascinating and and with <unk> , <unk> productivity , <unk> productivity that they forget that that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day , you would eat .
and according to the , , they survive that years years by making their famine by eating and the the the the next .
just , i think , we &apos;re going to do now .
we put games to get the to the the world .
we put play games to avoid that in the real world not work in real real life , not not sort of not , and we &apos;re going to take ourselves of the play .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
according to the , after 18 years after 18 years , the famine didn &apos;t come better . so the king , they were a last <unk> <unk> .
they were the kingdom in two .
they were playing a <unk> and and the try to try to break out a <unk> adventure .
they were <unk> and and looking for a new home . they were just so many people people , how to to survive , and to the the to the rest of the rest of the to they could have .
sounds sounds crazy , right ?
but in latest <unk> show that the <unk> that that later that the that the the the same dna as the old <unk> . .
so , scientists recently , that the <unk> story is true .
and geologists found the evidence of a global <unk> , , almost 20 years of what could possibly explain the famine .
so this crazy story might be .
you you actually have her people through play , by playing for 18 years , they have <unk> games and then they have these <unk> and and so much about this , that they &apos;ve learned that they were too the entire civilization .
so , we can do .
we &apos;ve been playing for &apos; 1994 .
this was the first <unk> in real time in the world of <unk> . this was 16 years ago .
they were <unk> for for years , we &apos;ve been <unk> .
i &apos;m to argue , we &apos;re ready to our own <unk> game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world . so i &apos;m going to take 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should to to that half half of us to play with playing half a day , we &apos;ve been solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve the real world in play ? &quot; and this is exactly the question i &apos;ve been working on the the for the last last years .
we have this <unk> in in in in in palo alto , it it out of how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future .
what we want to do is create the future .
we want to introduce the best result , and then people empower people to make this idea into reality .
we &apos;re doing some reasonable wins with some people and people people to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you three three games that i designed to try to make people some of in their own future .
this is a world without oil . &quot;
the game is by 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> that you have to get a <unk> .
the the <unk> , , but we have enough <unk> to make it to them , and it it to be , and , and , and , and , if you &apos;re to to , , you , you , you can , , and you can you , how how it &apos;s not how how <unk> are being <unk> , how how it &apos;s not how how <unk> are .
we tested this game in 2007 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve it since the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a experience experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventure , and they said , &quot; we &apos;re going to take the . &quot;
this is a intriguing adventure that you &apos;re going to .
find out how they would survive . most of our players have have the in the game .
so we &apos;ve got a a greater game , a bigger , higher goal .
we &apos;ve the the game &quot; <unk> &quot; the the future .
starting to start is a a of a that that humans have only 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global <unk> <unk> , &quot; , of course .
the call to the to to run , , we almost almost like a <unk> <unk> .
you know jerry <unk> , where the &quot; <unk> , &quot; they have the astronauts , the scientists , and only , and only can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five , , say , everybody &apos;s in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our task to the future to energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players were playing the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 creative creative solutions that you can read read if you are google . &quot;
and the last game we give out march , it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you &apos;ll get the the the bank bank , &quot; social , &quot; by the &quot; . &quot;
we &apos;re working with universities in sub-saharan sub-saharan africa and to to to .
we have a comic book . we have &quot; level up &quot; for <unk> , , sustainability , sustainability , and and and ingenuity .
i &apos;d like to invite you all invite this game with people , people all around the world , especially in the world , especially in <unk> , to to their own social companies , to to to save the world .
i &apos;ll come to the end .
i want to ask you a little bit .
what , do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t have the real world yet .
well , i hope that you agree with that that human human resources are that we can use work in real life , and that games have a a meaning meaning to change .
we have these these these , <unk> productivity , the ability to handle strong social networks to make more <unk> , and the desire to <unk> .
i really hope that we play together to play to to this planet to live on this planet .
and i hope you &apos;ll play with me and play playing .
if i i to the next decade , i &apos;m two two two , , we can create any <unk> future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the the .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about what i a a few months ago , writing a a article for the wired magazine .
i &apos;ve been doing my <unk> next hand hand hand , but i was done with the of of text , and i realized that i &apos;ve never been in my life , which is &quot; &quot; really . &quot;
i read reading the post .
&quot; disabled , &quot; <unk> , &quot; , helpless , useless , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
<unk> : healthy , powerful , sensitive . &quot;
i read this list out of a friend loud and and had to laugh , it was so ridiculous , but i only only up up up up , but i couldn &apos;t get to to read and read and read to me to and to to to and to get to to the <unk> emotional shock .
and of course , this was an <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and i thought thought that the issue has to be quite old .
but in fact , it was a issue in the early &apos; 80s when i started elementary school , and started to to my sense of sense of my family family , and , also , in terms of other children and the world around the world around me .
and i didn &apos;t use a <unk> .
i would i would take this post seriously i would be born in a world that someone like like a person would be perceive , life , in any sense , but today , i &apos;m going to have the odds and adventure i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately to to to to , and , and , and i expected to find a a <unk> of .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
especially , , me , the last two words words under &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and healthy &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in in those words , and how we build these these .
our language our language , and how we see the world and people around us .
a lot of <unk> societies , including the greeks and the said the the , said that the because the because of a <unk> a big force , because what you can to <unk> , you can also .
so , what do we actually want to do -- an disabled people or a powerful people ?
now , a a a child , to be a child , , be enough , <unk> and <unk> and you .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open open doors to open doors ?
a human who opened up to me , my pediatrician pediatrician british british institute in <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , how you think about most americans couldn &apos;t say , , , so he was always called dr. <unk> .
and dr. <unk> was always very colorful , and was to work with kids like kids like .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my <unk> .
i had hated the best time that makes it with these big , <unk> <unk> -- -- in different colors -- -- you know , to to my my <unk> , and i hated it . i hated it . i hated it . i hated it . &quot; i hated her . &quot;
and imagine , i actually said , as a child with dr. <unk> and tried to to this this , , , without success .
and one day he noticed me in one of my , -- these these , just tiring and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , you know , you &apos;re so much , powerful and <unk> girl , you &apos;re going to one one one of these tapes .
and when you create it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
and it was just a simple trick of dr. <unk> , so i do the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with the chance that that richest five five young girl in in the hospital , but he actually got me to look at my daily new , , , and , and , in fact , , this is how a new and a new .
and i wonder how much his vision of me as a strong and incredibly young girl girl , and i was able to imagine that as a of nature , powerful , powerful and powerful and <unk> human .
this is just an example of many of many of how adults can make the imagination of a child .
but how the most of the examples of the <unk> , , doesn &apos;t tell us our language , a space , something that we would all of us , to do that , each single one to allow themselves to be able to see themselves as powerful people .
our language language afterwards that she was in in a lot of the in a lot of technological change .
and from the point of view , of course , that my legs , the legs , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and that allow people to really use all of their own , , to to to natural destiny , people to to natural destiny , people to to natural <unk> , , to to a natural destiny , people to to natural destiny , people to respond to natural <unk> , people
so maybe that technological change is clearly clearly clearly because ever , that there was always a different truth , which is that every person of society can something something and and powerful and and that the human capacity to adapt to your greatest plus .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story because people always ask me to ask about how to <unk> , and i &apos;m going to say , i &apos;m going to say something : this , this , i , i , i , i , i , i , i i , i i , i i , i i know , i i to to know why .
this one of the <unk> of with <unk> lives of the idea that success depends on whether it depends on a challenge to a a challenge , not to be shaped by the way that my life would be much as much as i could stop the the of life , or as well as i could stop the the of of life .
but the truth is that we change we are , of course , we are by the challenge , whether it physically , emotionally or even both both .
and i &apos;m saying that is that &apos;s good .
<unk> are no obstacle , we need to be to to to to to with our lives .
the <unk> are simply to our lives .
and i tend to see <unk> as as a .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very , , sometimes he &apos;s hardly see , but it &apos;s constantly to me .
and i mean , if you don &apos;t want to impact the the the of the the of a human .
there &apos;s a lot of life in and challenges and and they are just <unk> and and every person is not about it , but the question is not , whether we &apos;re not , , but we we it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for that people who love to keep the , of <unk> , , but to for it to come to it .
and we &apos;re learning to our kids , if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt to .
you have to be two things : : : one : one the medical fact , be at , and to the other , to the to whether i am disabled , or not .
and to be honest , the only real and and to disability that i had to to be to , is that the world is constantly meant to me , it could describe me this definitions .
in our want to protect the people that are the to the the and you the cool true truth about your medical survey or or or you to to a a what you &apos;re going to be , we we don &apos;t have the the to get a .
maybe the &apos;s the process that is going to watch , which is in in one , and how we fix this , for every one more larger disability than the brain &apos;s brain .
if we &apos;re not treat a and not not all its its power and opportunities and understand and understand , we , we to to the natural struggle that you might have to take a , one disease .
we &apos;re a a people who has a a value . society .
so we need to go beyond the <unk> , and we all all the the of the human possibilities .
but most importantly , it is that there &apos;s between our <unk> and our our <unk> , , a connection .
we should not be these <unk> <unk> or or , , , we should not to try to avoid them , even should go to the the carpet , but it &apos;s about the the the .
and it &apos;s me to be more sure that we we don &apos;t necessarily need to to get <unk> , , but we &apos;re it to to to to to them to to to to them , and use a <unk> , and maybe even dance .
and maybe we can do it , as a a natural <unk> , and and useful and useful and useful and feel that of presence of this presence .
in this year we celebrate 200 200 . birthday darwin charles darwin and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , darwin , in my eyes , in something very true in the human character .
i would say it it , not the most powerful of its kind , and also not the the of of the , , but the that can change change the best .
it &apos;s from from .
not just of darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive and survival and <unk> , the struggle of the human mind is to to transform it into conflict conflict .
so , again , change and adaptation , the greatest of of people .
and maybe we know , we can we &apos;re from the wood we are we &apos;re actually a .
maybe that is exactly the sense of <unk> , a a of of the , a sense of our own power .
we can give us something to .
we can give a a new importance of <unk> times .
maybe we can see a change as change .
<unk> are for a change we we not have yet adapted .
i think the the the the that we have to to to think is that we should be normal .
and , who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the common . the typical . . but not the normal , , and you would have this arms , and you have to know , where you really should , if you really should ?
i think , don &apos;t .
it would be great if we put this paradigm of normal normal of the other or or strength , even to even more to more more to more , , , so we can the forces of the , and we can invite the forces of very special and valuable skills to society .
and we found that we &apos;ve been found people by the members of our society , one one one , to be useful and to to create a contribution .
there are evidence that that the neanderthals were the ancient elderly and people with with some <unk> or people have been with and and that was because the <unk> of the the of of these people was important .
they don &apos;t think of these people as <unk> and useless ; they were treated as special and value .
a couple years ago , i went to the city , i was growing up in a <unk> in in the <unk> red zone in the northeast , and i was there in a a <unk> . .
it was summer , and i had <unk> . .
and i hear how a guy said , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i take up and look at this older man . i had no idea who he &apos;s .
and i said , &quot; excuse , sir , we know know ? i can &apos;t remember remember . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you remember remember remember .
when i first saw it , i i it out of her mother &apos;s your mom . &quot;
oh , so , so .
and of course , it did it it .
this was dr. <unk> , a man who i i knew my mother my mother of my mother , because i of course , because of course , my birthday was two weeks .
the doctor for <unk> medical imaging medical mother was on vacation , and my parents had the the to the the to the the .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet were to you , and i just some toes on this and and some some toes on the other , he had the <unk> , , he had to make the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents , you you never going to walk , and never be so be able to be , as other kids , or you would never have an an life , , and since then you just have me to lie . &quot;
i really found this was really extraordinary , i was collected my my childhood childhood , , no matter if i won in a second class in the second class , if i was the the <unk> <unk> , , and i had a <unk> , <unk> medical school and and the <unk> medical school and and the <unk> medical school and and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this this one of his <unk> , the potential of human human will .
you can &apos;t be enough to stress how critical to this factor of the quality of life .
and dr. <unk> , he says , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids if you &apos;re not told something else , and if you &apos;re just getting a little else , and even if you &apos;re a a little bit of you , you can do children . &quot;
you see , dr. <unk> has changed .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how somebody do it to do two different things .
and i also have my think about time when you asked me at the age of 15 years , if i had my my of against as meat and bone , and , i would have no second <unk> .
i wanted to to work at time .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not sure sure .
and that &apos;s what happened because i experienced something with my legs , and despite that experiences .
and maybe that change that change , because i &apos;ve been so many people people i &apos;ve opened to me , , instead of people people who me me me or me an idea of me .
look , it really needs just a people who you you about how they can their forces , and they are .
if you allow you to to your own your own , , the the human mind is so <unk> -- if you can do that , and for someone to a moment , someone someone someone someone , you you are a a you &apos;re a very good teacher .
they bring them to to open doors .
the real meaning of the <unk> is its roots in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means to produce something that in is a potential of potential .
again : that potential we want to do that ?
in the 1960s , in the britain , in study in the early , <unk> <unk> .
they call this &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the united states , we call this &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the students are divided into notes .
and the a student get <unk> <unk> , more , , , and so .
they then they have a a <unk> time <unk> time with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very &quot; &quot; &quot; and it was told them them are they were very smart , they were very smart , and after these three months , they really had <unk> .
and of course , it it to hear the heart , that vice the the the , , they just only .
and it was , after the three months .
but just those who were still in school -- except the students students had got the school .
the the of this study was that teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something has changed .
they just said that are the <unk> and that are the students with grade grade . and they have taught them to do something and and they did it .
the only real disability is a <unk> mind a mind that was broken , never was broken ; he &apos;s no more more <unk> , our natural , , <unk> , , our our our our our our our .
but if we do it , we create the human mind , to continue to keep yourself , , and other people around to find beautiful , and and , and then we our forces , we really really really positive .
if if you have a mind about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new new .
i &apos;d like to end with a poem by a poet poet named <unk> <unk> in the 14th century , and i wrote about my friend jacques <unk> , and the poem is called the god god , &quot; the god god , the god , the god , not the god , the god , not the god god , the god , not the god god , the god , not the god god , the god , not the god
come , come with , thank you .
how would you be better than you &apos;re to right now ?
suppose suppose that , by a few changes of your genes , a better memory -- more more , more more , more and more .
or you want to <unk> , stronger , more power .
would you like to become more attractive and more ?
how about it to live longer in a ?
or maybe they are one of those who are always always to to to more creativity .
what would you like to do ?
what would you like to have if you could just have one have one ?
creativity .
how many people would would creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
some of . . it &apos;s probably about as many as people people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you decide a good memory ?
some more .
how about a ? ?
a few less .
what about longevity ? longevity ?
ah , the majority . i love to be a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is that just a ?
or is it possible possible ?
evolution is a <unk> issue of the conference here , but today i want to tell you one doctor &apos;s show .
the great geneticists call the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was an <unk> in the russian an <unk> , , wrote a paper , &quot; there &apos;s no any of in biology , no sense of any sense of evolution . &quot;
now , if you are one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good time , turn their your <unk> , , take your personal <unk> -- i give you the you , and you can tell you , because you can you have a you &apos;re going to be that , because nothing else is going to be a .
but if you accept biological evolution , you think , is it &apos;s just about the past , or it &apos;s about the future , or it &apos;s about the future ?
is it for other other of , or it it us ?
this is another another view of life .
in this picture , i &apos;ve a bush as a center of the <unk> in in all directions , because if you look at the edges of life , the the of the the the of these branches , all the the the of these branches , you know , it has it ; it has it ; it has it ; it has it ; it has it ; it has it ; it has
the human part of this <unk> , far , far , , of course , is what we most most about .
we are continually of of a ancestors of a lot of about six or eight million years ago .
in that period , maybe 20 or 25 different <unk> of hominids .
some are come and and .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> .
it seems like we were we were pretty remote from the of the &apos;s of of life , but actually , most of the most fundamental mechanisms are very quite the .
now , you realize that we can use it from it , and the the of of common bacteria can produce the to produce the protein of the human <unk> , which is used to treat the .
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> from what &apos;s from the pancreas .
and we already talk about bacteria , you know that that each of us in our gut , more bacteria than it has to be cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times as so .
i mean , think if antonio damasio uses to to sense of what self , you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm ; it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;ll give you all nutrients that they might be able to be in some effort .
it &apos;s a a big way for bacteria , fully <unk> of unintended charts , <unk> , <unk> push to the to .
but otherwise they are a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as as they are important for their lives .
they help <unk> nutrients . and they protect protect them against certain diseases .
but what will going come in the future ?
are we in a kind of <unk> balance in a a species ?
or are we &apos;re to be something else -- something that may be adapted to the environment ?
now , we &apos;re going to step back about a billion years ago -- the earth , the earth , , about four and about four and four billion years ago -- the first piece of two of two , three billion years ago -- and the the the -- -- the first <unk> of , , or billion years , which is as much as a billion years , which was the the the the the the the the the
in this this this this sort of tunnel of the universe , the life is only a long , , the the animal kingdom , like a single , , and the human life , a small little <unk> .
we were .
this is also the the of of this speech , so i &apos;m , because ate it .
now , when i was a <unk> in college , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by the elegance elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell fell in love with the power of evolution , and i , something very very , in most of life in life organisms , , , all the life , all the genetic information needs to be on both two <unk> .
but at the time , when <unk> organisms turned up , and began to change things .
sexual reproduction is into the image .
and important important , the introduction of sexual reproduction , the the genome are going to be the rest of the body .
in fact , you might say that the <unk> of of death of death in evolution in the moment of the as the population is reproduction .
now , i have to say , if i was a <unk> , i thought , okay , okay , sex / death , death death death -- it seemed pretty reasonable to the point , but it has been quite reasonable to the point , but every year , it &apos;s to to have more doubt about .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , in read his show in las vegas his show in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s one pat on his <unk> .
he opens the door .
and it says a beautiful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
she looks look at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; george says , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the as a doctor that i was a a goal that was a a goal of evolution as a <unk> of evolution -- not only different .
i tried to keep the body .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i wanted to to to the health of a disease .
i wanted to to to a long and healthy .
evolution is all about the on the of the the generation , adaptation and survive generation generation .
from from a evolutionary from from , , you &apos;re , and i &apos;ve been to <unk> the the to the the the next level of orbit around the next level of orbit around the next
i think we would all the the , the the of the to the expression , he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do immortality through my work .
i &apos;m going to do by by not going to die . &quot;
evolution don &apos;t just necessarily the the the the the .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily necessarily the largest largest , , the the and the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution evolution , the creatures that adapt to their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of the and success .
on the the ocean are bacteria are there , and the <unk> are going to be or the hot steam , if fish were there , it would have a vacuum cooking fish , they &apos;ve made it to do it an <unk> environment .
so , what what that means if we look back look back what what happening in evolution , and how we think about the place of people in the evolution , and in , and , and , in the next stage , i would say that there &apos;s a number of possibilities
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve reached a way of balance .
and the reasons that that that it is that it &apos;s first of all , , we &apos;ve managed to get a lot of genes that were otherwise been <unk> and the population had been taken out of the population .
and secondly , we as a species have a species of our environment that we we able to do it to us to adapt to them .
and by the way , we go and and and mix , and we have to say that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary to the evolution , to the evolution .
a second way is that it &apos;s be a evolution of traditional , , of course , is by by by forces forces forces .
and the argument that this would be here , the wheels of the evolution of slowly , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and so far the isolation is , if we face a species species , a species , it will be <unk> and the change the environment that could produce evolution in natural natural .
but there &apos;s a third way , a a , fascinating and intriguing and terrifying possibility
i call it <unk> -- the new evolution that not just not easy , but course , but led to us as a <unk> in the decisions we do .
now , how did that happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
now let &apos;s look at reality reality that the people today , in some cultures are making their their their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women . women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the the and the family decide .
so think if it &apos;s not only possible to choose the the of their child &apos;s gender to also do genetic genetic to , the to cure and prevent the .
what if you could do the genetic genetic to remove diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or to eliminate the risk of risk and
would you not want to to do these changes in their genes ?
if we <unk> , , these kinds of changes are increasingly be increasingly .
the human genome project started in in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost <unk> billion dollars .
in the following year , when it was done in , , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in <unk> to four months .
today , you can see a sequence of three billion against of human human genome to a cost of about $ 20,000 20,000 and in the space of a week .
it will not take for a long time to reality that it will going to be 1,000 $ 1,000 human human genomes , and it will become increasingly available to everyone .
before a week , the national academy academy engineering sculpture british prize for francis arnold arnold and <unk> <unk> , two scientists , the the of the the , the the natural process of evolution in a more sense -- which is called the <unk> called &quot; which is called the called &quot;
a couple of years ago , the <unk> of the <unk> for for for his research in which he took a adults <unk> , , and <unk> , and through only four genes , the the of just to to to a a stem cell , to be able to be cell in your body .
these changes are in .
the same technology that is that human insulin is can make viruses that not just just protection from them , but also also to to stop but but but also to the of of .
believe it or not , it &apos;s a experimental study in the vaccine against <unk> that that in the cells in a <unk> of a <unk> .
can you imagine a good thing that &apos;s from of of of ? ?
this is all right now , and in the future will be possible .
now , just think two other small changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the the of your descendants ?
what if you could change the <unk> and <unk> or the fresh <unk> <unk> the <unk> to to kids to a better opportunity for a <unk> -- , , the diabetes , the the risk of cancer ?
who don &apos;t want to healthier kids ?
and then the analytical analytical technology , the same engine of science can allow the to prevent disease , prevent disease could adopt us to adopt , , to adopt , , , <unk> -- that will be better .
why don &apos;t the <unk> <unk> of ken <unk> , , especially if you can expand it , the next generation of the ?
why not the fast <unk> have that allow you to to to and run faster ?
why not live longer ?
these are going to be <unk> .
and if we &apos;re at a point where we can pass it on next next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want to be transformed ourselves into <unk> evolution .
we &apos;ll have a process that requires 100,000 years , possibly also , and we can reach it on thousands of percent -- and maybe even the the next 100 years .
these are decisions their their their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , they need to be .
and we use these decisions a society that is better better than the more successful is the more friendly ?
or are we going to have selectively different attributes that we want to have for some of us and not for others ?
are we going to make a society society and <unk> , or more robust and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions we need to be to .
and the most of all , we will ever ever be able to develop wisdom , and the wisdom that we need need to make that make make that make that make that make that make that make that make that make that make that
in good good in bad bad , and until they think think , they &apos;re going to be these decisions .
thank you .
i want you to imagine a a a a portable robot that gives you to <unk> skills , or one another , who helps you to stand up and and to .
we call <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
they &apos;re nothing else something that you put in the morning and you &apos;re more and and it can move on its speed , and you will help you to your balance .
this is actually the true <unk> of human and machine .
but not just that -- and together and connect connect with the universe and other devices out there .
this is not just a idea idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we we start talking about the american soldiers who &apos;s about about 100 pounds on the back , and it &apos;s the demand for that they should have more equipment .
of course , this leads to a a of a sense of <unk> -- <unk> percent of it -- <unk> <unk> .
so we thought we would would take this challenge , and we create a a <unk> that that would help to deal with this problem .
so let me show you you now -- or human human universal <unk> .
soldier soldier : i can carry 200 pounds over <unk> over over the terrain , many hours .
his flexible design enables it to to be deep , and and and <unk> <unk> .
it feels what i want to do is where i want to go and get my strength and resilience .
we &apos;re far , with our <unk> of this device , this this this new <unk> in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s take our look at our wheelchair users , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people , in the world world .
this is about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re talking about very young people with spinal cord injury , and <unk> &apos; at the <unk> of life -- 20s , &apos; 30s , &apos; 30s , &apos; and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the population of the have times times .
and so pretty much the option -- if it comes to a <unk> , or to other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so it &apos;s been for 500 years , since his , since his , , i &apos;ve got to say , really , successful .
so we thought we we we could start to do a a whole new chapter of mobility .
now , let me give you a <unk> that by by amanda <unk> , which is 19 years ago , a a <unk> had had to be that they couldn &apos;t walk around over 19 years and and .
thank you .
as i said , amanda , our <unk> . .
it has sensors .
his completely <unk> sensors in the crutches , the signals of our <unk> , to the on on your back .
here &apos;s also <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , on their <unk> , as well as their <unk> , they move forward in this fairly <unk> and and very smart .
i was 24 years old and and in <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> me .
in a fraction of a second , i lost each of and and movement and the movement of my . .
not long after a doctor , a doctor in my <unk> , and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go back . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he steel each steel hope hope of my consciousness .
<unk> technologies have been able to to to to to back to climb up , and and even to the hands .
but nothing was invented again , would leave me , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms for us to meet us and discuss them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential here to change life life life -- not just for the of the military , , for amanda , , and so , all users , but for all .
thank you .
home in new york , i &apos;m the by the <unk> of a non-profit organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t <unk> the poverty , i <unk> a <unk> of a a volunteer <unk> .
now in our city , volunteers a a <unk> <unk> <unk> supported a early early on the <unk> to be able to be <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer at the <unk> , so i had pretty good opportunity to be .
but it was still a run against the other volunteers to reach around the other volunteers and find out what our would be .
and when i found the <unk> , , he had just a very serious conversation with the <unk> , which had certainly had one of the worst of life .
it was in the middle of the night and she stood in the <unk> and and barefoot on a a screen , on the <unk> , , in the the house in the house .
the other volunteers who was back to me -- -- we call him <unk> luther -- got the <unk> of the first , and was asked to go into the house and save the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was lost <unk> .
there was any lawyer or a lawyer or <unk> , who could tell the rest of his life , he could tell that he was a a a house to save a living , just because because he was five seconds faster than i .
well , i was next .
the <unk> <unk> me to .
he said , &quot; uh , you go to the home .
they have to go to the the fire , and the have have to get a a of shoes . &quot;
i swear to him .
now , not exactly what i would would i would go -- and the walking walking up the hallway , the the , , the the , that this at this moment , when you &apos;d put out on the , , into the bedroom , to a a .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey to where i my my my and my <unk> and the beloved dog .
we put our <unk> to the the , , , , not surprising , , , , , more attention than my .
a few weeks later , the <unk> of a letter letter in which she had to the the brave house for the house of your house .
and one of all , , our our , , you had had a few shoes .
in my job in robin hood also as well as my <unk> , , was a of generosity and kindness in great scale , but i also see the the of and and the <unk> of individual .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i see in this room and and people people who either have been able to have a a <unk> success or or on their way , i want to offer a reminder : don &apos;t want to be .
don &apos;t wait for a difference in life in another , until you &apos;ve got their first million .
if you give something to give you , you &apos;ll give it now .
they they into a <unk> , , you park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day , we will give us a chance to save a people &apos;s lives , but every day offers us the opportunity to change one .
so they put them on them . save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m coming back from a community that knows the secret of the <unk> of humanity .
a place where women women the the , &apos; hello &apos; hello , &quot; and the game is the day -- where it &apos;s a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their <unk> .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the forest .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees , chimpanzees , our other living living .
that means means we have a common ancestors , an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of this human human human human .
but bonobos can show us the other side of the coin
as chimpanzees , of big , fear of big <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> female female female .
they really have up with that because because this leads a a <unk> society , in the has been not noticed in the .
but unfortunately , bonobos are known known known among the .
they live in the deep deep of the <unk> , and the observation are just hard to to .
congo is a paradox -- a of of the most extraordinary and beauty , but also the heart of the dark self -- the the of of a violent argument that &apos;ve been been for decades , and almost so many lives in the the world
it doesn &apos;t surprise that these destruction destruction also the the the bonobos at the bonobos .
<unk> and the decline of the <unk> to you can &apos;t get a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> bonobos -- and even there , and we &apos;re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a <unk> of laugh that the trees are upset .
who are these relatives ?
we know them as &quot; love &quot; rather &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , because you have <unk> , , also sex with <unk> , and and and and and and and and .
i &apos;m not saying that that would be the the all the humanitarian issues -- because the bonobos is made of more than the <unk> <unk> .
bonobos -- -- how people -- love to play their lives .
play is not just <unk> .
for us , and it &apos;s essential to the connection of relationships and the the of the tolerance .
and we learn trust and the rules of the game .
play will creativity creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the creation of diversity -- diversity diversity of diversity , diversity of of the diversity of connections .
and if you see bonobos at the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance , , and .
play is the <unk> that &apos;s <unk> that we us .
now , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you some few some unique footage out of the wild .
first of a <unk> <unk> -- -- and i don &apos;t think about it .
so here we a a female female and males in a <unk> . .
look what she &apos;s doing .
this could be the evolutionary origin of &quot; you you get it to the eggs . &quot;
just i think it &apos;s like , it &apos;s it , not true .
yeah !
so <unk> are <unk> both bonobos and people people as as as people .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this is really interesting , because this is really interesting because it shows the the the new elements in the -- -- -- -- -- -- how the -- and also , as a time is time to do .
but the game is a <unk> . .
play is a <unk> , and it can take a lot of forms of people are a little quiet , <unk> , curious -- perhaps to to to see this surprise again .
and i want to show you , this is a <unk> female female and she &apos;s with with with .
i think just like you play , , and we sometimes alone , and we &apos;re <unk> borders of our inner worlds .
and it &apos;s these playful curiosity that make us explore , interact , and the unexpected unexpected kinds of knowledge that we form are are real breeding breeding of creativity .
this is just a small <unk> of on the insights , bonobos bonobos will give us the way and present .
but she true true a secret to our future , a future that we need to adapt to rising to increase and to to creativity and and . .
the secret is that the game of the key to this skills .
in other words , game is our <unk> . .
to make us successful in a world world , we need to play .
but are we going to do the best of our our ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
bonobos and people , , life is not out of their and claws alone .
if it , if it seems , , may seem to be at the .
and so , my favorite , , let &apos;s give this gift of evolution and giving together together , as we the the creativity of <unk> and and the wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two two pairs , 1979 , in the same same day , exactly same same moment , every single baby &apos;s -- okay .
so two couples , every <unk> of a baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to use too much time time the the , because , because if you you imagine the the the time , you , you don &apos;t listen to me .
imagine that just for a moment .
and in this scenario , you think that in a case , the that the the of the writing a y <unk> that &apos;s the x chromosome .
and in the other case , , the that that that that the x , which is the x chromosome in the .
both are both <unk> , both fire .
we &apos;ll go back to these people later .
most of my most , i have two <unk> .
under a hat , i &apos;m in the the of the anatomy .
i &apos;m a school student , and in this case , i study how people <unk> anatomy anatomy -- -- -- -- -- -- body body body -- like with <unk> <unk> , with <unk> ; it &apos;s thinking about body .
the other hat i &apos;ve in in my work is the activist , as <unk> -- or , as i say , as a , &quot; -- of people who are patients patients patients .
in this case , i worked working with people who have the <unk> , the social norms in the .
so , for example , i worked working with people who are identical twins , two people in a body .
i worked with with people with <unk> -- -- people who were smaller as a common .
and i &apos;ve been working with <unk> people , their gender , their gender -- -- so people who don &apos;t have the much male or female <unk> .
and generally , we can use the word for the .
<unk> comes in many different forms .
i just give you some examples of the of the types of <unk> that are not the the male or female standard .
in a case , you might have a with a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , the the <unk> that we we the stage , we have <unk> , , <unk> .
and that &apos;s why this has <unk> <unk> at the <unk> .
but because this individual individual &apos;s missing for those those receptors to recognize the testosterone , the body is not not to the .
and that &apos;s called <unk> .
so a lot of testosterone , but it &apos;s not response to it .
and as a consequence , the the of the the of the is going to be .
if the child is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it it takes time to to puberty and and her breasts grow and and developing , but not get their period until someone comes to that here is something different .
and they &apos;re making some tests and find out that they rather than <unk> and , , , in actually <unk> , and they they had a y .
and it &apos;s important to understand that that you could actually think this person for actually fact , but they don &apos;t really .
women , how men have in our bodies , something called <unk> .
you &apos;re in the back of our body .
and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that which are <unk> hormones .
most women , like like i -- i believe a typical woman -- i think not know , i don &apos;t know , the real <unk> , but i think that &apos;s probably the the -- most of the women i actually talk about <unk> .
we make <unk> and we speak on <unk> .
the consequence is that someone is , i actually , a brain is that more <unk> , when a woman who has born with , , a a <unk> . .
so gender is really complicated ; <unk> are not only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some sense , you can see over whole range .
another example , i got a i got a a 19 years ago , man who was born as young young , , a young , he had a friend , had had had her her , her her , her , and he had found he had a <unk> and a .
he had an extreme form of an innate <unk> .
he has <unk> <unk> , and in the womb , his own <unk> were so strong , that they basically created a male male <unk> .
and as a consequence , his <unk> male ones , his brain was the brain of the <unk> part of the <unk> .
and when he was born , he saw a boy -- nobody saw something .
and it was when it was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , in fact , because he &apos;s looking at <unk> , that the doctors found that he was standing on inside the female female .
okay , so , just one quick example of a <unk> of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , something called the called <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
so gender can go in many different varieties .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- be <unk> twins , be <unk> , -- from surgeons often become adapted to the norm , isn &apos;t because this is a for their physical health of
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they often do is often do these these are are are , , because they threaten our social categories .
typically our system is based on the idea that a certain amount of can do is by a certain of identity .
so we &apos;ve got the concept that a woman is to be a to have a female identity means to be a black person , is to be supposed to have an african anatomy in terms of your story .
so we have this terrible <unk> idea .
and if we face with a body that actually really something very different , , , really , to to these these .
so we have a lot of of of ideas about <unk> .
and our nation is really really really really a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now you can imagine how amazing it is when the is born when children are born , are two people in a body .
where i had been most of the most of the most of the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> in in in in .
many people called me me , &quot; which which is you will you to tell tells us whether or you &apos;re <unk> female female female or male male ? &quot;
and i had to tell the journalists that there &apos;s not that test .
now we we know that gender is complicated enough that we need to admit that nature is no line between the male and female and female and female and female and female and female and <unk> , we are we that that that that that that that that that .
so we &apos;ve got this one situation where , , the , we continue to say , we have to say more that these these categories that we were in for robust both of both of , which are very simple simple <unk> produced to create a more <unk> , than we have
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
it also true true to terms of what as much more complicated than it has been allowed to be our <unk> .
in our our , we we all all sorts of <unk> areas .
so , we &apos;re push for example , in the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we start to the fact that we &apos;re just just by you by a few different <unk> ?
as we move our science forward forward , we come into a zone of the , , we we to to recognize that the the <unk> categories that we &apos;ve had too too .
we see that in all sorts of of human life .
one of the areas where we see the the the <unk> , in our culture , in the united states , the the , the are the the beginning of the beginning and the end of life .
we have have hard conversations about what point point point of people is that he &apos;s a a different right as it &apos;s kind of
we have have a very tough time today -- perhaps not as public as public medicine -- the question of when someone is dead .
our ancestors had never been to fight with the question when someone was dead .
they have a a a a a complexity in the , and when they moved , they didn &apos;t buried it .
if you move it , you &apos;d buried it .
but today we &apos;re in a situation where we &apos;re people to take people organs and and to put them to people .
and as a result , we we we with the really hard to say , when someone is dead , and that brings us to a difficult difficult situation we we don &apos;t have a very simple categories as we used to be .
now you might think that the the of categories are kind of someone like me happy .
i &apos;m a politically <unk> , i &apos;m a <unk> with extraordinary bodies , but i have to say , it &apos;s nervous nervous .
to to realize that these categories are really much more talented than we thought , was .
and it makes me tense in terms of democracy , about democracy .
so to tell you about this <unk> , i have to be that i &apos;m a big fan of the founding life .
i know that were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i think that they were so <unk> and and and radical , in what they did , i all all of years to be the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that is absolutely to forget .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happened to the <unk> .
the founding fathers could able to be the original <unk> activists , and that &apos;s why .
and what she was a <unk> concept , and it it it through another , which was radical and beautiful and 200 years of our .
as you all remember , , our fathers fathers also the the idea idea , and the monarchy was based on a very surprising concept of anatomy .
the the of the old world didn &apos;t have the dna based on dna , but they had a concept of the .
they had a concept of blue . .
they were the notion that people who had political political political political political do this political , because of the <unk> <unk> the the <unk> for the son and the son and so on .
the fathers would move back this idea back and replace it through a new <unk> concept , and this idea that that &apos;s all people have been created on the same .
they <unk> the playing field and decided that <unk> that that , , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they did it part because they were part of a <unk> system in the two things in common .
the democracy grew up , but at the same time , it grew up .
if you look at the history of fathers fathers , clearly that many of you were interested in very science , and they were interested in a concept of a world world .
they walked away from explanations , , and and things , like a supernatural concept of power , back , where the transmission is based on a very <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and if you look at the independence of independence , they talk about nature and nature nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to say we are .
and part of them , they get us a concept of <unk> has been .
and so they they really really , really wonderful the future rights rights .
they don &apos;t think about it that but what they did for us , was great .
so what happened to years after that ?
for example , for used , women who the the <unk> <unk> , the concept of the founding fathers that is that there &apos;s be important important than both both both both , and said , &quot; that we have a a , and , , not significant enough that we don &apos;t have the significant lot of the , , don &apos;t deal important , , , don &apos;t deal important , , don &apos;t deal important , , don &apos;t deal
and women are successful .
next came the successful civil rights rights where we people people like <unk> <unk> , who , which is <unk> , &quot; am i am not woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> of of the <unk> , which say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people have more from from the , on on both in the , , , , successful .
we see the same thing in the <unk> .
of course , the problem is that , we begin to look at all the common , we need to start asking asking to ask , why we sustain certain <unk> .
now , you you , i want to make certain <unk> , <unk> , , in our culture .
for example , i want like to a a fish , you know , the same one of the people .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that the right to have to be to to to their informed informed or marry .
so there are some anatomical <unk> that that make sense of me , and that we think , think , i think .
but the challenge is to trying to find out what are are and why we keep them and and whether they &apos;re make sense .
so let &apos;s go back to these two two , are the beginning of the talk .
we have two two , both in the middle of the same day .
imagine that one of them , maria , maria , three months of born , so she &apos;s born in june 1980 1980 .
<unk> , on the other hand , it will born in the <unk> , so he &apos;s born at march march . 1980 .
just because of the fact that maria 3 three months born born , they they all all kinds of rights , <unk> -- -- the right <unk> sex , the right to choose the right .
<unk> has to wait for all of this , not because it actually has another serious age , just because of the <unk> of his birth .
we find other more <unk> about what what their rights are .
<unk> , you think that &apos;s male -- although i i &apos;t told you that it &apos;s with <unk> -- -- you just think that &apos;s male , can now be moved into , , where would &apos;t have to worry about the .
maria hand , in all states can &apos;t see all the same same that which <unk> <unk> <unk> every states , and it &apos;s right to marry .
<unk> <unk> can marry a woman , but maria can just be a in a states in a a states .
so we &apos;ve <unk> these <unk> <unk> categories are are are are are are are are are are are are are .
and for me , the question is , what are we going to do , because our science of this is in the field of the anatomy that we we to to that that we need to be that a democracy that &apos;s based on anatomy , <unk> ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time it feels like the science is going to be on .
so where are we going ?
it seems like that , a kind of pragmatic stance -- : &quot; well , we need to be a line somewhere , so we pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people caught in a very very strange position .
so for example , texas at a point , that , that a man means that you don &apos;t have a <unk> talk , &quot; and a woman means that you have a y .
now in practice , people not tested test their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very weird , because of the story i &apos;ve told you about the the .
if we look at the founding fathers of modern modern , dr. martin luther king , he &apos;s told us in &quot; i have a dream &quot; a kind of solution .
he says , we shouldn &apos;t tell people &quot; your skin skin , but he &apos;s judge the the of his character , and go beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you people people people because of their ?
i also want to point out here that i &apos;m not sure that we &apos;re to to all of people to people , because i must say that i &apos;ve got a a of <unk> , which are likely to get more comfortable than some people i know .
i want to to be that i probably probably know , some light <unk> , , <unk> are <unk> , more intelligent and more ambitious decisions about your sexual decisions about some of the people i know .
so how should we have the question of the moral ?
it turns out to be really hard .
and part of me , what what if your content would be if your source would be something that would be in in the future -- an an was able to be an an .
do we really want to go to this ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it seems to really important to think about the idea that the united states is in is to make about about about democracy .
in our our for democracy , we did really doing really well , and i think we would make our our our in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation of how it &apos;s in in iran , where a man who <unk> sexually <unk> to to men to be in the death , because it &apos;s ready to be a <unk> in in which case he &apos;s to to be .
now of these kinds of exist in we exist .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these conditions -- a surgeon who i spoke a a few years ago , who had a few <unk> twins had been to separate them to separate them , to do it .
but when i asked him to him , and asked asked him why he did these surgeries -- it were high surgeries -- -- his his country , that his country , these kids are very bad , and so he had to do it .
i i him , &quot; well , have they have political in in rather than rather than to do them ? &quot;
the the the the incredible opportunities to allow people allow to be that they are without without to be to to the state .
so i think we need to be able to go .
all right , just to end , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot lot about dads .
and i want to think about the ways of democracy could look like or looked like if we had more involved more .
and i want to say something that is a a radical radical , and i think that there are different kinds of ones that could be about different kinds of anatomy that are are the different ways of the other , <unk> , when people apply a <unk> . .
for years , because i &apos;ve been interested in <unk> , i i i interested in research in the field of the field .
and one of the things that i really really interesting is is the difference between men and women in ways that they think and act in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned about <unk> studies is that women , in the average -- not every , but in average -- more to complex complex relationships and the care of people who are vulnerable to people , are a lot of attention to be a lot of attention .
and so , if we think about that , we &apos;re a interesting situation about us .
years ago , when i graduate graduate student asked asked me of my favorite student who had knew my interest in feminism -- i saw as as as as as it was -- really strange curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s a is a female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the <unk> question i ever ever heard .
it &apos;s about about gender gender gender , so not is not not female .
but the more i thought about his question , i was thinking that there was something more <unk> in feminism .
that &apos;s what it might be something , in average , , and women are women brains of different different different of different relationships of our relationships , and <unk> and <unk> for for the to the the .
so the the founding fathers could were extremely been to find out how individuals could be protected , the state , it &apos;s possible that if we &apos;re more mothers into this concept , we more a concept of , , not just how to protect the other , but how to use for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we &apos;ve got to go to the future , we about democracy about anatomy -- less about individual body -- to think about the individual body , and more about relationships .
so , if we try to make a a of , , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i i &apos;ve in in is i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s what i am obsessed with <unk> .
i love to each another opportunity to find a different kind of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and to to to to for you .
but i don &apos;t buy new .
i get all of my clothes from my hand hand and <unk> and in <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to to the impact of my <unk> on the environment and also the on my wallet .
i meet all all sorts of great people ; my dollars are serve for good good , ; i see quite unique ; and it &apos;s shopping power to the of of my , and power power .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it going to have my size ?
am i going to color color ?
will it going to be less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers to the answers , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;ve been all for this this exciting at ted .
i mean , what does someone with with so many ? ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i &apos;ve brought here .
i brought brought with you from here , and this is all .
and for one week , all i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i told bet that i i all all of what i wanted to wear , if i got to look after palm springs .
and since you &apos;ve been heard of me as the woman who &apos;s around here at ted , <unk> through the , , i &apos;ve found some things .
and i want to to show you my favorite for for this week .
sounds good ?
while i &apos;m doing that , i &apos;ll also leave you some of the lessons that i think believe believe it or not , you &apos;ve learned from these <unk> , nothing from .
let &apos;s start on sunday .
i call it the the .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look to look great .
you can almost always always great for for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the one has five to five , and it was the most expensive piece that i &apos;ve carried in this week .
monday : color is a powerful bit powerful .
it &apos;s almost possible to be bad , bad when you &apos;re wearing <unk> pants .
when you &apos;re happy , you raise other happy people .
tuesday : <unk> will <unk> .
i spent a lot of time my life , trying to try and adapt at the time at the time .
just just who you are .
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , they &apos;re not just to understand it , they &apos;re also appreciate it .
wednesday : giving your inner child .
sometimes people say me me , i would be like if i want to get up with you , or i remember you to their . .
i &apos;m smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re seeing in something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think that they &apos;re not look very well , you &apos;re probably probably going to be right .
i grew up with a mother that taught me day day day .
but only when i was 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;ll just going to take it for you .
if you believe you &apos;re inside and the outside , you &apos;re a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to <unk> everything that we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> fit .
and finally , saturday : one own unique unique , to be able to develop a a of the world , a a a way to tell the world without a word .
it was been proven to me and and when when people came to me , , because of what i was wearing . and i had had great conversations .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to take all all of all .
because the lesson i i myself is learning is that it &apos;s okay to let &apos;s go .
i don &apos;t have to emotionally such things emotional , because the the the corner , it &apos;s always a crazy thing , <unk> , <unk> , , , , , me me , i just love to love , and i &apos;m a .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good day , all together .
i &apos;ve got something i want to show you .
think of this as a as a <unk> flying . .
this is what we call in our lab , <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now if you take this image -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every young in italy , in the in in this image in his room , but the reason why i &apos;m showing you this is what i &apos;m showing this is a very interesting in the the of decades .
a while , it was , if you wanted to win a formula to a , they they their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and when the car and the driver were good enough , they won won the race .
now , today , you need to win a race , actually , something like this -- something that &apos;s a car in real time , some a few of sensors , the information from the car , and then you can to this and then you and this this and then you use this car to to and and then you and this this and then you use this car to create this car
this would you would call it in <unk> , a <unk> . .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that made from two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> . .
now what &apos;s interesting is is the <unk> that &apos;s begin to begin to our our lives .
our cities were , in the last few years , just with networks and <unk> .
they &apos;re going to computer in computer .
and as computers , in the , , start to to other ways , and they become all and driven .
if we <unk> cities , that &apos;s actually a big thing .
just by the way , i just want to say that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s world , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the <unk> -- improve 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
and out of the cities , , all of this , and driving into objects of the everyday life .
this is from an exhibition that paola antonelli takes to moma during moma during the summer , .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
well , all of our objects , our environment , start to to to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as any atom out out there , a a sensor , a a .
and that &apos;s what changes the interaction that we humans out with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost as the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , when it was shaped the moses , it says he he took the hammer and he walked it on moses , and they can still see a little <unk> of <unk> -- and said , called &quot; <unk> <unk> ? why are you &apos;re talking about ? &quot;
well , today , our environment , for very first time , first time to answers .
i &apos;m just going to show you a few examples -- again , to idea of our environment and be able to be able to express our environment .
let &apos;s start with the . .
now the first project i want to introduce you is is one of the first of our lab .
it was a four four and four and four and four .
and what we did done is actually , actually , a was a to use new kind of network that has been used around the world -- -- this is a <unk> -- and anonymous and and information information from this network that are taken from the phone to understand how the city works .
summer summer summer was a very summer -- 2006 .
it was as italy , the <unk> .
some of you will remember , it was as italy as war france , and then the end up the end , the <unk>
and no , italy , in the won won won won won won won won .
now look at what happened on this day , just the the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see see in the middle , the <unk> <unk> .
the morning , the game .
you see see the timeline line .
the used to be , in the , and here , the calls made and and .
the game starts -- silence .
france is a gate . italy makes a gate .
<unk> , people do a a call , go on the toilet .
second , . the the normal .
first number , , second .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> .
italy : the . yeah .
now , in night , all all went to to celebrate .
they saw the big big .
the next day , all all the the to the the the the and the prime minister .
and then everybody came down .
you see seeing the image of the place <unk> , , , since the roman time , the the time , to celebrate to celebrate a big party , and you see the the at the end of the day .
now , this is just one example of how we feel today the city , in a way way we haven &apos;t it .
quickly , another example of is : this is not about people , but about people things that we use and consume .
well , today , we know all about how we come from .
this is a map that shows you all the potato chips , which is a mac computer that came together .
but we only know little bit about where things go .
so we actually actually in this project , some little markers , designed designed to the the garbage as it goes through the system .
so we started started with some volunteers , which us , a little more than one year in seattle , helped have helped tag things that you know -- different kinds of things you can see -- -- things you you would throw away away .
then we have the small chips , the small brands that are the little and and put it down .
here are the results that we &apos;ve just got .
seattle !
after a week .
and this this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in in the system .
we can do the same things in actually doing less energy .
the data was not available .
but that &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we think that if we see every day that the cup that we throw away , not just away , not that that it &apos;s still somewhere in the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we throw away every day .
and if we could show that people , we can able to change change change .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague at the , <unk> <unk> , , could you could be a lot more about about and and the other wonderful things that you can with , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part of the we we in the beginning , and this is
and the first project is something that we &apos;ve done in <unk> , a few years ago .
it started with a question of the <unk> , who came to us and said that that have a beautiful tradition of <unk> in in public places as part of the architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , to make technology ?
and one of the ideas that were been in in a <unk> <unk> , , imagine these tubes tubes , and the valves , <unk> , , , open , open , open .
they cause what a <unk> of a <unk> with water water .
if these <unk> fall off , they can write it , they can be pattern , images , the .
and you can approach him , and it will open up to make them up to see how you can see on this picture .
now , we introduced the mayor <unk> .
it it very much .
and we got to do the building building building the the expo .
we called it the the digital water .
all the building were made out of water .
there &apos;s no no doors or windows , but if you &apos;re him , it will open it and it it .
the roof was also covered with water .
and when it &apos;s annoying if you &apos;re going to go the mycelium , they can even get the roof .
or you could conclude the building , and the architecture will be , , in this case , you know , this time , when you get the roof , you get images of people , they were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve got the building . &quot;
no , you don &apos;t destroyed the building , it &apos;s just that that &apos;s almost disappear .
here you see how the building works .
you see the person who wonder what happens inside inside inside .
and here you see me , when i tried to test the sensors that that that that the water that will not get wet .
now , i should tell you what one night was when when you did the the .
but actually , it was a more more fun night . night .
all the kids come from <unk> came to the building , because the way they were played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that open up to to them , but a building , but a building , obviously , and holes in the water , you had to get jump without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people people things that we are designing .
but reality is always unpredictable unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the nice thing about creating things that are used and interact with people .
now here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> of water and the <unk> of the and the projections on it .
and this is what we brought us about this this this project which i &apos;m showing you now .
imagine if you could really do this this <unk> , you can .
imagine if you could have little helicopter that you fly through the air , and each of you with a small <unk> light with light -- almost almost like a cloud that can move move around the
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the you saw earlier , with other , completely in .
you can have these cloud .
you can have a kind of a screen or or or or like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or irregular but but in the , which is changing , the light is not the position of the .
you can play with different kinds .
imagine the screen of the screen , just in different different <unk> or sizes , in different different .
but then it could only be a 3d cloud of <unk> , which you can walk up and and through them through that you can move out of many , many directions .
here you see a real <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to form a <unk> v .
if you turn the light , it looks like this . just just as we saw it before .
imagine that every single single of people will be controlled .
it could have a a a a impulse that comes from from people people by people people or so .
i want to show you something of first of all .
we worked with <unk> <unk> , one of the best most of our time -- the the at the metropolitan theater at the metropolitan theater and the <unk> in in -- we &apos;ve in the in in 3d , to use it to a <unk> to use it
here you can <unk> <unk> dancing .
on the left-hand side , you see the <unk> , the different different of .
it &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> . .
so that you can feel that whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then once we all have <unk> , , can play with it with with that and with color and change .
we want to to a a a a a a a a .
i want to show you the latest project we we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we work on the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
and the idea is again , imagine that , again , people people to do things and change the environment -- almost almost like we call it , <unk> like to <unk> the way , but with a cloud .
imagine if each one has a little donation for a <unk> . .
i think that the remarkable thing about happening over the last years years , the last decades , that we &apos;ve changed from a physical a digital world .
this has all digitized all , know , and it it it through the the .
now , for the first time , we the the campaign -- and the campaign has this -- -- can we from the digital world , from the the of the networks of the networks of the physical world .
that can be , in our case , we we &apos;re using to design and create a symbol .
that &apos;s &apos;s called something called the city .
but tomorrow , can to to the the challenges to the -- think about the climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we move from from the digital world to the to the physical world .
so the idea is that we actually actually engage people with people in things together , collective .
the cloud is again a cloud , <unk> , in the same way a cloud is a cloud is a cloud .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud .
it &apos;s an physical physical shape in london , but it covered with <unk> .
they can move move and different kinds of experiences .
you can actually see it from the bottom of the , most most moments of <unk> 2012 and also other , and it &apos;s use to use the to the community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something something that you can go to the place of london new <unk> .
you can get inside .
and a kind of digital digital center in night -- but as a <unk> , a new type of experience of all that want to go to the top .
thank you .
as artist artist is very important to me .
by my work , i &apos;m to to express that people are not separated from nature and that everything is connected to each other .
the first time i was been at a decade ago , a decade ago , where i saw my first girl .
so , awe taught me .
my heart would go , i was <unk> , i was trying to love what i was doing .
the <unk> around me feet feet feet , 60 feet of the water , and i just just wonder that this was a snowflake on another snowflake , a year year .
<unk> were born as a calf of a glacier or by by <unk> out of <unk> .
every iceberg has its individual individual personality .
they interact in in a in a emotional environment and their experiences .
some , give up and and they &apos;re <unk> to the the , while others don &apos;t have any <unk> and and <unk> passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you think easy to be isolated , separated , separated , and just as we look at people .
but the truth is far away from it .
as a iceberg , it , , i , i , i , i was the its <unk> .
as the iceberg , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> drinking water drinking the the that that many life forms .
i go to my my of this that that that i when i was making portraits of my ancestors in the consciousness that they in those individual moments , that , and never never again
it &apos;s not death if you &apos;re melt ; it &apos;s not an end , but it &apos;s a <unk> of of the life cycle of the life .
part of the ice in the the that i &apos;m very young is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of ice is is more than 100,000 years old .
the the i &apos;d like to show you a a , that i want to be a iceberg that i &apos;ve in in <unk> in
very rarely , you actually actually clean an iceberg .
here you see it .
on the left-hand side , you &apos;ll look a little boat .
that &apos;s about about feet long .
please watch the shape of the iceberg and where he &apos;s on the <unk> .
you can see here , it starts to roll , and the boat is moving the other side , the man there .
this is the average size of a <unk> .
he he <unk> 120 foot out of the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just like , , showing you the iceberg , a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life really really really blessed by the work of some amazing projects .
but the the best i &apos;ve ever worked on , was was about this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> of the &apos; 80s .
then one day , he came back from running back and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the .
<unk> is completely paralyzed .
he can only use his eyes .
i was in him .
i have a company that &apos;s design and animations , and , is inevitably an an sense of what we admire in the art art .
so we &apos;ve decided to -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- and to support his .
i met with his father and his brother and his brother , &quot; we will going to give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony .
i just want to to him again , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , i i &apos;ve no stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all all the paralyzed people people in these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , just if you &apos;ve to to the higher <unk> and and a a has a really a , you can do it .
ordinary people aren &apos;t available these these . . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate to ? &quot;
anybody saw the film &quot; &quot; ? &quot; ? &quot;
so they they communicate -- they &apos;re running along .
i <unk> , &quot; <unk> , how how can that be ? &quot;
so i came to the need to make a a , , and instead , i a check check from which i didn &apos;t idea idea of how i had to <unk> the idea of how i should to .
i i to to to the place and his his father and his father -- the words , &quot; well , my suggestion is like to talk : tony &apos;s going to be , , and we &apos;ll find a way to get his art .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s all that it &apos;s not . &quot;
so i was a a couple months later .
i met these people from <unk> , graffiti graffiti lab lab and they have a technology that allowed them to put a light on the surface and then put a a a <unk> on the , , which is just the negative area .
so they &apos;re <unk> around and doing <unk> like this .
they say that all of things that are shown up there , a life of life .
it starts with the the , , the <unk> , the the , and the the , and the the , , actually actually art .
but there was always a life life in his presentation .
so i went home and ate her wife and her wife and and we thought , &quot; well , time , , second , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use your eyes , to can can can can can can can can can a a , that that can can can can a a that that that can can can a a that that that that can can a a that that
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , a lot of organization and a lot of things , and we &apos;ve done some things .
first , we have the insurance insurance companies the the doors , and actually actually get a device for <unk> to be able to communicate -- one stephen <unk> <unk> .
this was incredible .
and it &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him <unk> , because because you talk about it , or get an email , and i think , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
and also , we &apos;ve giving seven programmers from around the world -- literally from every every of of the world -- to us .
my wife , my children and i moved in the garage , and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> and have taken our house .
many of our friends thought that we were beautiful stupid that do that and that we were <unk> and and all images images on the walls were <unk> <unk> .
but for two weeks , we &apos;re programmed , we went to the in in venice , my children were involved , my my , and we were created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> system that we bought in the of of venice , something <unk> and and some things from made and and and and and the .
we took a <unk> , , they have <unk> , they have a <unk> on a <unk> , and now we have a device that &apos;s available to be -- you can build it , , we put the code that software that can do free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely entirely free .
no insurance can can <unk> .
no hospital also .
now , <unk> <unk> can actually communicate with his eyes , draw .
thank you .
thank you so much , that was incredible .
so at the end of two weeks , we went back to <unk> room .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else and this is his room .
now , this is all of these <unk> , great unveiling .
and after about about a year of planning , two weeks , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and took the for the first time .
and this is an amazing image , because this is his life support system , and he sees beyond his life system .
we just leaving your bed to see out out there .
we &apos;ve a a that a a wall of the the the hospital .
and he drew back to the first time , in the family and friends and friends -- and you can just imagine what a sense of what a a lot of the .
so , we had to to in the parking lot of the , , so we felt so as part of the <unk> .
he he he sent us an email with what : &quot; for the first time , i &apos;ve been something .
i i feel , i was made under water , and finally , and , and i up and my head down and i can breathe my head . &quot;
isn &apos;t that ? ?
this is something like our <unk> . .
it &apos;s going to and and and and and and and and and and .
and we need to have a lot of this device .
it &apos;s a amazing device , but it &apos;s a a a a .
and somebody who has an such an potential potential , so much more .
so we &apos;re doing to figure out how to do it better , faster and stronger power .
since that time , we &apos;ve all all of of recognition .
we won some prizes .
remember , it &apos;s free , no one us us us us .
it comes all from our our pockets .
the <unk> , , &quot; oh , this is fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> : and then , december , , to to the the one of the 50 best invention of 2010 , which was really really .
the the of this is -- and that does the circle -- -- that it &apos;s this april , in <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of los angeles , or or in the , of the &quot; of the &quot; of the &quot;
and there are be pretty much the the the the the of the <unk> to be -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys are going to be there .
<unk> is going to be part of the show , which is pretty <unk> .
so basically , me , if you look something that is impossible , it &apos;s impossible , then it can do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this computer , this microphone , the <unk> -- -- it was impossible .
do it possible -- they all all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer and i had never had something to do with <unk> , but i just got to with something and i with with amazing people , so we could do something to the legs .
and that question should each one of them will be and every single day , that you see something that has to be done , if if you don &apos;t have , if if , when , when not i , , who ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and probably probably america &apos;s probably the most mostly <unk> .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to come to a a scientist .
you can have me , you , , , , , , , , but nobody has ever elected farmer .
today i want to tell you about today and and .
well , one is is something that usually is that you you have it somewhere .
you &apos;s about block block and it it was a revelation .
this is a paintings of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of more complicated that i want to tell you about today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s at the , in <unk> , ohio , where i was the .
i was the one who every week in the <unk> green and the blue , and to a a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using me the toilet in the <unk> .
so , they was in .
she did it three years .
and i had to get away from the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it proposed to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and in the in the , i found it a work in the in the &apos; 80s ,
about three or four years ago , i got a phone phone in the night of this teacher , <unk> post , said , &quot; i &apos;ve got to see you .
i &apos;m sad that we never know each other as adults .
you can come to ohio ohio , and please come come to with the man who i know that you found it .
and i should mention that i &apos;ve got <unk> , and i want you to stand out . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew that had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them to , and we took us to them , and we gave them to her family , because it needed to be .
it was something that knew we knew .
and i was like the woman who who wanted to learn me as a , , she turned into into a box , and was put in my hands .
what happened was that the circle closed was the circle , it was become a circle -- and the revelation of i &apos;ve talked about .
the revelation is that death is part of life .
she has saved my life , and my my my my and i saved saved .
and you know , this part of life needs everything everything else needs all the rest of life .
it needs truth and beauty and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that it &apos;s been mentioned so often .
it needs needs as same — it needs , love and pleasure and and it &apos;s to to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , as you &apos;re up 1,000 yards .
so you an an an an an
imagine a engine , , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
that sounds <unk> .
well , i had a unique place to this day ; i was sitting on <unk> .
i was the only one who could speak to the <unk> .
so i saw it right , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve probably caught some birds . &quot;
the pilot had the machine , and we were not so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later three things three things .
the pilot was set up the the the river river .
that &apos;s not not that route .
it &apos;s the the engines .
imagine a <unk> plane .
and then he said three words words words words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> to the &quot; &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the <unk> .
i could see it in your eyes , there &apos;s horror , life was to end .
i want to share with you three things that i learned about myself on this day .
i learned that in a moment is a little bit different .
we have this <unk> , we we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to do a hand , and it didn &apos;t do , and it &apos;s &apos;t , all the the that i wanted to do and i never did .
while i thought about it later , i thought , &quot; i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collecting bad brand . &quot;
because when the wine is , and the person is there , and i open it .
i never want to move more any more life .
and these urgency , this goal , really changed my life .
the second thing that learned learned that day -- and that was when we <unk> the george washington , , pretty much about <unk> -- -- i thought , , there &apos;s one thing i really really <unk> .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i , i , i , better , i , i , what i &apos;m going .
but in my humanity , i gave my ego .
and i &apos;m the time that i &apos;ve wasted for <unk> things , people who are things .
and i thought to the relationship with my wife , to people .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to to to to the negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t have me with my wife &apos;s two years with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have right ; i decide to be happy .
the third thing i learned learned -- and while the inner clock is <unk> , &quot; 15 , 13 , 13 , 13 ,
you see the water .
i said , &quot; please , in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want that thing to break in 20 parts , how you know about a <unk> .
as we &apos;ve <unk> , , , i had this feeling , dying , not to die .
almost like , we &apos;re prepare for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this sadness <unk> really in a one thought , which is that i just one thing .
i just myself , i could my children to grow up .
about a month after after a month , i went to a a of my daughter -- <unk> , not a lot of talent .
... not yet .
and i &apos;m , i share a little child .
and in the world , everything a sense of me .
i was i that i that by that , by connected to each other that it &apos;s about a great father is about being a great father .
more than anything , everything else is my single goal in life , be a good father .
i was the the was to to day .
i got another gift to see , which is to the future , and coming back and and .
my call to all of the that you can do today : imagine the same thing on on your flight -- please -- but imagine what you do ; and how would you
what would you do that they if they think they they they they always be there forever ?
how would you change your relationships and and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , they are the best parents that you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> is is quite easy .
we don &apos;t want to get the bomb .
the the <unk> in the nuclear nuclear is the nuclear nuclear in in <unk> .
the gray boxes you you &apos;re seeing here is <unk> .
now if we we to to the systems systems that control systems and control the the , , we can actually cause a lot of problems with a centrifuge .
these gray boxes are not run with <unk> ; they are based on completely different technology .
but if we create it , an an <unk> <unk> , a a a laptop that &apos;s used by a <unk> <unk> , to to this these gray box , then we &apos;re
and that &apos;s the planning behind <unk> .
so we start start with a <unk> . .
the the <unk> , in the the gray box , he he the centrifuge , and the iranian <unk> in -- <unk> .
that &apos;s a easy , right ?
i want to tell you how we &apos;ve found that .
when we started to our research in six months months , unknown , was unknown , which was the sense of the sense of the .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , to the <unk> part of the <unk> , , he made the <unk> of of <unk> their own . .
and it seemed to be something little bit more <unk> , these gray boxes , these <unk> <unk> .
and the <unk> , our attention , and we started a a project that we built with <unk> , and and that made that construction .
and then something funny happened .
<unk> <unk> making a <unk> <unk> that that don &apos;t liked the cheese for the -- <unk> , but didn &apos;t want it to eat it .
that &apos;s &apos;t make any sense in my eyes .
and after we had experimenting with various family of cheese , i went to that this is an <unk> attack .
completely started to certain certain .
the <unk> <unk> active in the the gray box when a particular configuration has discovered . even if the special program that &apos;s trying to get there .
and if not , it doesn &apos;t do anything .
so , really really really interested my interest , and we started working with it , all about the saying , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , we &apos;re able to make a <unk> power power power power , or a <unk> in germany .
so we should to find better than what the goal is .
so , <unk> and <unk> , and we found the code code , and he found that in two digital in is <unk> -- a smaller and a bigger one .
and then , we were been that they were very been very , by people who had obviously all the all of information information .
they knew any bits and <unk> that had to attack .
probably even probably knew the the of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve already that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high-tech , let me tell you : the <unk> are a science .
it &apos;s much more difficult than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you can take a clip from this <unk> code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
looks pretty like <unk> <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we we were able to become pretty clever .
so after what we went first , were <unk> <unk> , because we know what this makes this .
and then we looked for <unk> and and and and and to to bring these into the real world -- with potential tools in the real world .
so we needed to know about these goals that could be to or prove .
and to these theories , we call we call that it &apos;s definitely definitely about <unk> <unk> , it has to act a a goal , and very likely to get in iran because because the have have reported in iran .
now , in this area , there &apos;s not several trials .
basically it &apos;s going to the nuclear power nuclear power and and in the <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list list of any of experts in the power power of our . . &quot;
and i called them and and you know , you know , to compare their expertise to compare what we found in the code and and the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to us to get the little digital digital with with the <unk> .
the speed is this this moving moving inside that , , , , , this black object , that you see .
and if you &apos;re this <unk> of this <unk> , you you actually actually to crack speed and and even even to to to to .
what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attack was actually , to slow it slowly and and really -- to to to , to , , to be , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get it to it
the great digital <unk> -- we got a insight by looking at very exactly and and we looked at .
so , for example , the number is is a is a very of that code ; you can &apos;t missing .
i started started out scientific literature , how this <unk> <unk> in <unk> , and and found that they &apos;re being <unk> in so-called <unk> , and each <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so , that made sense , it together together .
and it &apos;s better better .
these <unk> in iran are divided into called called called called .
and guess what what do we found in the <unk> ? ?
a &apos;s almost identical structure .
so again , this really really well .
and this gave us great confidence for that we here here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that wasn &apos;t just that .
these results have been some of a several weeks .
and often we just ran into a end end and we had to to to .
anyway , we found out both both digital digital in in actually , and the same goal of <unk> , but the different of .
the little <unk> takes takes a <unk> and <unk> and and and and and you and it down , and the large <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> and and .
so , in the whole , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals of <unk> are be met .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered discovered -- has been <unk> my .
there &apos;s the gray box , there &apos;s the <unk> box , you see the the .
now , what this thing is is that it &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> <unk> -- so -- for example , <unk> and <unk> -- and it &apos;s <unk> code , and it &apos;s the attack , with the , with the
and in fact , this wrong gets <unk> of <unk> from <unk> before .
so it &apos;s just as in <unk> , in the , the the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> has fed the <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
and the idea is not just , the idea of <unk> <unk> in the the room room .
in fact , it &apos;s more dangerous and more sophisticated .
the idea is to <unk> a digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> there where a human <unk> can &apos;t react fast enough .
so in a power station , for example , if the great <unk> is going to be up to the <unk> of
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human <unk> .
so , this is what we need is the digital <unk> .
and if you are at , you can actually happen bad things .
the power station &apos;s explode .
and neither the <unk> , , the <unk> , , it &apos;s going to notice .
this is scary scary .
but it &apos;s getting worse .
and what i &apos;m saying is is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
he &apos;s nothing to do with with <unk> , with <unk> .
so , for example , he would work as well -- in a power power -- in a power plant .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- -- the the -- you don &apos;t need to have the <unk> of the stick of a <unk> stick , how we saw it in <unk> .
you could use a ordinary ordinary technology to to to .
you have to spread out as far as possible .
and if you do that , you &apos;ll get a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the consequence that we need to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals don &apos;t have in the in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all all green areas , these are the most environments environments .
we need to make the consequences and we &apos;re going to make better .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was a lot of that people people assume that the the is the the the the .
is that also your opinion ?
okay , you want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
and i think , is the <unk> , , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the most sophisticated superpower .
there &apos;s only one and these are the united states -- happiness , happiness .
because otherwise our problem is even more .
thank you for us to a <unk> . thank you , ralph .
i spent the last few years to put me in situations that usually &apos;re very hard and and the same time .
i went to jail -- hard .
i worked working on a <unk> -- dangerous .
i was shot in <unk> -- hard and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days of it , nothing like this -- fun -- are getting a very , a little , in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i &apos;ve been most of my career career , to <unk> situations , and this all of this for trying to get the way to the for the , of the , , and , and , and , and , and , and , to a a of of , , and it &apos;s made for the .
so when i knew that i was coming here to get to look at the world of <unk> and <unk> , and i knew i knew i would do something little different .
some of you may have heard that i &apos;ve had a couple of weeks ago a a of ebay .
i would get a couple of <unk> , some <unk> , , and i gave people the opportunity to to the the to the to my tedtalk .
and really , some lucky people and companies companies , <unk> and <unk> , got the that opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let me , the the that you can &apos;t see a a , that you can see that that was a a , , a lot of you can see that that was a a , that you you can see that that was a a was a a , and you can &apos;t see a lot of
so , what you got was : : : : : : my tedtalk , you know , you know , you know what the subject is going to be , and the you you the to the the for the ears , , especially if i could look her her their their their their .
but it &apos;s it &apos;s a very good media at .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot of . .
this is just the the way .
so , i know , warning , i that i &apos;d &apos;d seen that anyone would buy the .
now if if you had asked me now this year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you this .
but in the new project that i work on , my new movie , we we the the world of marketing , the advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve been doing a few terrible terrible situations in the few years , but nothing could prepare me nothing , nothing could be anything to me , so difficult as any , and to these guys into a space .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i &apos;d like to do is a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing marketing marketing and advertising , the whole movie is funded by <unk> <unk> <unk> marketing marketing and marketing and advertising .
and the film will &quot; the <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the <unk> <unk> is is that everything from up from up from the beginning to the end , completely -- -- the the -- -- the the <unk> , the the , that &apos;s the brand brand &apos;s brand .
now this brand , <unk> <unk> <unk> center -- the center center ...
these people are connected to the film in in in time .
and so the whole idea of this whole idea -- this is what ? in , , forever ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more to the bug .
it was &quot; &quot; in &quot; , &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand problems , but we &apos;re sure we &apos;re going to be a , we &apos;re &apos;re not selling any any other of in the movie .
so we may sell a shoe , and it &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe that you ever &apos;ve ever carried ...
the the world that they ever ever went out , &quot; the the <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; the greatest drink that you ever had , a of &quot; the &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is to show that , that brands are part of life , actually actually to to make it film ?
and we actually actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole movie is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing about the film .
so this is the whole concept , all the , from the beginning to end .
and i would be excited when if you were to help it to happen .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
but i don &apos;t know how <unk> people will be .
have you a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use it &quot; &quot; , &quot; because this has a negative negative process -- but you know how to develop ?
how much money will needs to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet , , but i think it &apos;s worth it it &apos;s value , some really known brands .
now , who knows when the film comes out , we might take a of a <unk> of .
what do you think the answer is going to be ?
the answer is likely to be &quot; no no &quot;
but is it a hard thing about the film or a hard thing to me ?
jk : both .
... means doesn &apos;t mean that &apos;s not that optimistic .
so , , , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands brands .
yeah .
if you look at people people you you have to do it ...
there are some places that we can apply to .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; &quot; you , &quot; i would mean , &quot; that would want to lead a a .
it turns out that it meant to be , &quot; we want to do nothing to do with her movie . &quot;
and just so disappeared all of companies , one one after one .
no one wanted to do something about the film .
i was amazed .
they wanted to to do nothing to do with project .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept that was idea idea of ad , to be your product as many people as possible , as possible as possible .
especially in the world today world , this this this interface and old media and the media media landscape -- isn &apos;t it the idea of being in this new exciting exciting <unk> of that the mass that actually actually the this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a <unk> mistake , and that was been that .
in fact , no , that was not the mistake .
that would have been any problem .
that would been okay .
but what this is is is this image , is a problem .
you see , if you look at transparency , the <unk> , this is one of the first images that seems to be .
i really like your kind , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency , by deception and <unk> and <unk> , simply find out and ; ; ; by by <unk> and access to information , especially the the last line is certainly the biggest one .
you know , we &apos;re listening to a whole lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president tells us , even our ceos say it .
but when it &apos;s , it &apos;s be be to be done , it &apos;s be done .
but why ? because transparency is fear fear -- like this strange strange bear that still still .
she &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and it &apos;s also a risky .
what else else else is there else ?
a whole a of cool food . .
this is a risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell it . &quot;
look , when i was a kid , and my father caught me at the lie -- and he he he &apos;s looking at me -- he he , &quot; my son , &quot; he &apos;s , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions of three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s real version . &quot;
so you can see , with this movie , we wanted to tell the true version .
but there &apos;s one company , a a a a for help us help us -- and this because because i think john bond and richard <unk> since i &apos;ve been doing it , i had to do it , i had to go to the the and and to to the companies .
so what you suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that , if you start talking to with these companies , the idea of the idea that is understand , a a is a sad problem .
i have friends friends who do big , huge huge giant giant , , and i have friends friends who are little little <unk> like me .
and my friends , the big , huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge amount of , saying that the reason why movies are so successful , the the the the that they have .
and then my friends who are making little little <unk> , , &quot; well , how are we all do with these big , giant <unk> ? &quot;
and the film called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so , how are we going to see you in the movie ?
whenever i do it , and i i , and i i open the <unk> , , you &apos;ll see you see you see <unk> .
and every time i get somebody to , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you right ? you &apos;re looking a little nervous .
i want to help you to calm down .
so maybe you should be a little little of of this interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great <unk> .
either either <unk> fusion or a <unk> <unk> , &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be for for men for women , , , , , , , , , or an stick , whatever
this is the <unk> . .
now , i can answer all of questions and and have a <unk> .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve been talking about the smaller movies , we are a a brand .
so we don &apos;t have the budget of the else .
so , things things like -- you know , reminds reminds people ban -- that &apos;s somehow why we &apos;re interested interested in .
which , what if you needed to break ban ?
ban is <unk> .
this is a great question .
<unk> technology .
technology is not the way that describe something that should be something that &apos;s going to be under the .
we talk from <unk> , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category really really really to positive positive positive , unlike by fighting fighting <unk> <unk>
it &apos;s fresh you .
how can we keep them fresh -- better fresh fresh fresh fresh , .
these things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> . .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to speak with the guy on the street that are like me , <unk> .
you should tell me about about about brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like really beautiful clothes .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , except for the <unk> .
all right , what &apos;s brand brand ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style that i have is probably &quot; most glamour . &quot;
i like many black colors , many <unk> , , and stuff like this .
but usually i usually have a <unk> , , like <unk> , or a jewelry and such stuff .
if dan dan &apos;s a brand , it would be a classic &#93; <unk> .
and the brand that i am , i would say , <unk> fly .
woman , : we to that part of <unk> , part of <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
man : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i selling <unk> around the country country , the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
and my brand is fedex , because i was <unk> .
man : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
is that ? ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> . .
i &apos;m tom tom .
well , we can &apos;t all the the <unk> , but i look at me at the interface of glamour and and and and .
and what i realized is that i needed needed a experts .
i needed someone to go into my my head , somebody who really help me understand what what &apos;s called the &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so i found a company called called <unk> <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , helped to discover these <unk> .
if you could do it for for the , you could help me .
you &apos;ve their pictures , right ?
i have that . the first picture is a picture of my family .
tell me tell you a bit about how this is with your thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who are my world .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world where you live in -- -- people people around , , the friends , the family , the way that lives lives , the work and how .
all of these things come from and begin from a place , and for me , and you start with my family in west virginia .
so , next thing that you want to talk about .
the next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what does it think about the thoughts and feelings about themselves ?
it &apos;s like i like to be .
i love things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i love weird .
tell me tell me about the &quot; &quot; -- what does it get us ?
what &apos;s the <unk> ? ? in what are you in the ? ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what &apos;s it represents red ?
tell me a little bit about this .
a little more about you , you &apos;re not .
which are you go through ?
... doesn &apos;t be afraid .
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you for your patience .
yeah . now . well .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be .
and so a lot of crazy things are .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their <unk> were two separate two separate , but the morgan has been a <unk> / <unk> brand .
and the add very well .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction that .
and i think some companies are going to be on a a strength , rather than both .
many companies tend to -- and this is the human nature -- things that you &apos;re not sure you &apos;re not secure , they &apos;re fear , and that they &apos;re that , and they actually turn them into something good , and it &apos;s a a <unk> in a good thing ,
what else else does that do ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can also see here here , <unk> , wii , <unk> of mini <unk> and <unk> .
well , there are <unk> brands and brands brands , these things that come come and go , but a <unk> , , brand brand is a fairly strong thing .
a <unk> , brand brand . how is your brand ?
if someone you asked to to describe her <unk> , , , , how would you be ?
you you a a ? ? are you something that brings blood in in ?
or are they more a a ? ?
are you something that a little quiet , more of a more conservative , conservative ?
<unk> are things things are are playful , fresh like the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , agile and agile , , , , , , and <unk> .
or are they more like a <unk> ? ?
are you you and <unk> and <unk> like ? ?
are they established , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , , , compassionate ?
are you reliable , stable , <unk> , safe , safe , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and how the dalai lama ?
and the the the film , we had more over 500 companies that up up and and up and and and &quot; said , &quot; no , because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they thought that they didn &apos;t have to do with this movie because they didn &apos;t have control , control , no control of the finished product .
but , found 17 <unk> who were ready to get to to those control that to to do with somebody who &apos;s so such as and and and and , and i , and that we had to tell stories that we would &apos;t have never had a a <unk> .
they &apos;re us to tell the story of the <unk> , , like the story of the , that that &apos;s used to be <unk> in the to the the of the brain , both and and for .
we went up to sao paulo , where the <unk> had been banned .
in the city , in the , five years , not a , , not a , , no , , no .
and we drove in school school school where companies are able to support their way in <unk> schools , in all the america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i got the most of from the way i had the most of the most , those are where i i with things things .
and that is what these brands have done doing .
because they <unk> the <unk> , , they <unk> the agencies , and said that that agencies might not actually have interested in their interest in .
i &apos;m going to negotiate directly with the artist .
i &apos;m going to work with it , and something completely different , something that people people think think think think that will challenges for our view .
and how did you do that ? what ?
now , the film film film on the &quot; film &quot; &quot; , we can look at this .
according to the , the the time , the &quot; in january , since since -- and this is not even the whole thing -- there &apos;s 900 million <unk> of that film .
that actually actually only a period of 2 1 2 weeks . weeks .
this is only online -- no press , no tv .
the film has not been thrown up .
there &apos;s not even online online . not a <unk> . .
it &apos;s not come out in other countries .
well , it &apos;s a film a a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project , which almost every <unk> of we we talked to to her customers to make their to .
something that i think is that that if you you reach , , , you , taking away , taking risks that in these risks .
i think if you keeps it by , you you &apos;re getting closer to it .
i think that if you &apos;ve to your employees to avoid , , you all all prepared to get out of the .
i feel that we we to to encourage people to to take risks .
we have to encourage people to have no afraid to have some of them might be .
after all , we should get to the .
we should put the bear into the cage .
they &apos;re the fear . .
each one of a big , , , we &apos;re going to welcome the risk .
and finally , we should listen transparency transparency .
today , more than than ever , , a a little bit of a lot of a lot .
and that , that , to to honesty and transparency , my entire talk called &quot; you , , &quot; you , from my good friends of <unk> <unk> <unk> for for for for ebay .
big data will be transformed into the world in large opportunities around the world .
<unk> <unk> : &quot; called transparency . &quot;
thank you .
well , , on the name of transparency , what is now is the the $ <unk> ? ?
this is a great question .
i have a check in my pocket , the the the of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a a check in the <unk> of the to the the next year .
my name is <unk> .
i was 18 months ago , i was doing else at google , and i &apos;m doing to make a work with museums and art art , my <unk> , which is also , there &apos;s a green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 , very very , from nine countries .
but i &apos;m focus on the show .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
i think my personal view is very easy with this slide and and to access to access to access .
i grew up in india .
i was a great training for me , i didn &apos;t know -- but i had too many many museums , and i had no access to this
when i went to go and visit these museums , i started to learn a lot of learning .
and as i worked for google , i tried to to to desire -- art -- to make more accessible -- technology technology .
we put a team , a team team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and you &apos;ll tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
so you go to to <unk> <unk> .
you can look around here in all these museums here .
there &apos;s the <unk> , , moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van gogh .
i even come to one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you come in in a way -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , you know , in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you go around and and it &apos;s .
you want to be able to the museum ?
open up the map , and you jump with a click .
in you &apos;re , you want to go to the to the gangs .
just just on . . .
look them . .
thank you , but the best one is still .
so i am i a a of my favorite <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> at met met .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum given us the image , they click on it .
now this is one of the images .
these are all the .
those of you who are really interested in art , can click here -- -- but i click it now .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve stuck with what we call the <unk> .
this image , for example , about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get 10 billion <unk> ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you now .
you can make a very easily and <unk> .
you see something fun here here .
i love this guy ; i love it is <unk> .
but then you really want to go deep inside .
and so i started playing around and and found that there &apos;s something that is going on .
and i thought , &quot; wait a moment , it sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close , and and noticed , , and actually actually put a little .
i &apos;ve a a little bit about some known with some known when met met , and actually found it it &apos;s a game called <unk> , which is a a <unk> to <unk> with a stick .
it seems that was popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to go close close to you can go to the .
just to give you the sense of what i , i , so you you see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best one is still -- in a second .
so let &apos;s jump down to moma , back in new york .
another <unk> of of me , <unk> .
for example , we had this to see details of the .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what &apos;s only when you want to see van gogh of this this .
you &apos;re in in . you can really go .
i &apos;m going to zoom in one of my favorite picture , i i really to to the .
this is <unk> , probably never ever seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite favorite function .
there &apos;s another another , but i &apos;m missing time .
this is really cool part , he &apos;s called collections .
each of you , everyone -- right if you do rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- don &apos;t matter .
you can go up and online online online -- from all of these pictures , you can make your own collection .
simply , you go into -- and i created this , it &apos;s called power of the <unk> -- you can <unk> .
this is &apos; the &apos; <unk> , in the .
you can do anything about it , your friends , and and a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think , finally , for me , the main thing that all these wonderful things not come from here google .
you think , you &apos;re not coming from the museums .
i &apos;m not supposed to say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was an experience of the to to
i mean , i hope that we will make this digital media to make art , and and online online .
and the the question is , the the question was , &quot; have you &apos;ve done this to replicate the experience of a ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s to to add to .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of her brain . your brain can be divided into two half .
this is the left half that &apos;s the the , and then the right half that &apos;s the intuitive side .
if we have have a measure of the the of the the the the data , we could be your brain .
for example , this would be completely true .
this would be somebody who is completely intuitive .
now , where would you go to this on this scale ?
some of us might have decided to have one of these extreme extreme , but i think think that most most people in the audience , your brain , looks like this -- with a high <unk> , , the same time
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both <unk> or so so .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and so i see as one of the people , in the other experimental <unk> , which need good good of to use the complex of the to to together together .
but at the same time , we need good good good of the experiments .
how do we develop these intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
so we go out and and play and and and then it &apos;s how it it it and then we start to develop our intuition .
basically , they do the same .
so one of the the that have developed for the years is probably that a thing at the time at the time time .
i mean , it can sound a little bit about that thing that thing is at two different places , two different places , but they were born with this idea , they &apos;ve been born with this .
i remember remember a kid on playing on a a .
he was a a a , and it &apos;s not very good at it , and he fell all the time .
but i bet that it &apos;s with the <unk> with a very valuable lesson , which is the big things that do not leave you , and you can stay in a place .
and this is a great <unk> model of the world , as long as they &apos;re not <unk> .
it would be a awful model for a <unk> , because it doesn &apos;t play with <unk> , but with these little strange things .
and if you play with their particles , you all all kinds of weird things -- how you fly directly to walls , or you can at the same time two different places .
and so they were all these observations , and they called them , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the age of physics from a few years ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little tiny tiny tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need it to describe the big objects around us .
this is not my intuition , i just not enjoy it as many as i don &apos;t play with particles .
well , i play sometimes sometimes , but not often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody ever seen one particles .
but my my idea , it &apos;s not liked .
because if all things things things are out of particles and all these particles are the rules of quantum mechanics , should not not to to the the
i don &apos;t see the reason why this should not be that way .
so i &apos;d feel better with the little better thing about the whole thing when we somehow somehow to that <unk> of quantum needs .
so i i a few years ago , i was doing that .
i created one .
this is the first object that you can see that was in the <unk> <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at is is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green point there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
here &apos;s what i &apos;ll up it . we look at at the center here .
and here &apos;s a really great close-up of this small little metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal , it &apos;s shaped like a springboard and it it on the edge .
so i did this thing in similar similar way that you &apos;re doing a computer chip .
i went a a clean space with new <unk> , and <unk> for for 100 hours of all the big . .
for the last last , i had to build my own machine -- to take this like a <unk> pool pool and the the thing .
this thing has has the ability to be the the ability to be in the <unk> , but it takes a little to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is so uncomfortable to be on a pretty elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m in the elevator , i &apos;m all all kinds of weird things , but then i show up to people , and i hear to do all of these things , because i don &apos;t want to fix them , or , , ,
so quantum mechanics says that <unk> objects are just feel .
the <unk> for objects are not only humans , but also the light that it seems to it , and it &apos;s wind up and the wind up to them and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal acts out of the , we had to take out the the out of the . .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we turned off the light , it put it into a vacuum , and it &apos;s all the air and it &apos;s almost almost to the the , , it &apos;s almost down to the , , the the the the space was to be to behave as it wanted
so we measured his motion .
we found that it &apos;s really strange .
instead of simply , it &apos;s just still there , it &apos;s the way it was like like this -- like like this -- like a <unk> and and together and together .
in we put a a a push , we could to to to right order to right right and right on the and right -- -- something that gives you in the quantum mechanics .
so what i just &apos;m going to tell you is really truly fantastic fantastic .
what does it mean for an object to right now , and right ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the the of atoms from the the of metal are still there and at the same time , the same atoms up and down .
just to precise <unk> voices , you . .
they &apos;re <unk> .
that means that every atom at two different places , two different places , what means that the whole piece of metal is two different places .
i think that &apos;s cool cool .
really .
it was worth of all of this year in the public public <unk> , because , , you , the the <unk> , the one atom and this piece of metal is about the the of metal and you .
so if one individual has been able to be two two different places , this piece of metal in two different places , why why not &apos;t you you ? too ?
i mean , this is just what my my my .
so , imagine you &apos;re at at the same time places , how would that feel like ?
how would you consciousness consciousness that your body is in the body ?
there &apos;s another one of the story .
when we <unk> it , the light light and the box , and the box is we we saw that the piece of metal was in a piece .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it &apos;s like all the objects in the the in only you &apos;re in in a small space that are in a small room .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
now , it &apos;s not right .
there &apos;s more more behind it it &apos;s even more .
it &apos;s that these connections , their connections with all of things around you , literally define who you are , and this is the <unk> and and and , and quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should think about the way we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if if families think about how to live , and they want to work and work , they have to give you the opportunity to pick at at at every of of cities cities that all of
at moment we &apos;re far far from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing developing world , not even one city available to the only city that they would welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they are so much more than it costs it .
so we could just the world world very simply with <unk> , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
now , might might be absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought about about new cities .
they just just construction the building of apartments from the .
imagine if half of people who want to live in apartments , this this already ; the other half haven &apos;t yet .
you could try to expand the capacity capacity of the .
but you know what you would to to you would be in in these these and and their environment are to avoid <unk> and and from the <unk> towards the .
so it turns out to be a very difficult to to these these these .
but you could go to a new new new , , new new family , , , , the the of that that the laws were going to build a build a .
so i suggested that governments new new areas that make enough to make enough space for a city and and they gave them a name of <unk> cities cities .
i found that , i found that , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> about the challenge of a reform in have been .
they knew that every year , every year , , around the country to go into the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country , can can the same thing in the .
and this is what &apos;s <unk> to <unk> <unk> , &quot; what happens when we put a <unk> area of our country , we we a a of the american message , a part of the american american , , and when people go to go to the the of of these messages , the united states , you can go to the the the of the the the the the united states , you can go to the the the of the the the the the united states , you can go to the the the
in the summer 2009 , had had had a <unk> <unk> .
in the the the , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in a a of the new health of new that he has .
he asked <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
in the meantime , i prepared myself in a talk at tedglobal .
by improvement , try and and down by consumers , , i tried to to this complicated concept of the <unk> of the world to study .
the first point , is importance importance of laws , laws that that we can &apos;t be able to do the existing <unk> .
we &apos;re to to new new new , , but for progress , it need technology and and and and it &apos;s usually the laws that are us .
in the fall in 2010 , a friend of <unk> , he was the link to the tedtalk .
and it showed him <unk> .
and they call me the two .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s say that the head of our country . &quot;
so we met met in december of a hotels in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make it clear how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than it .
and i used using this graph to show how valuable valuable is is on a place like new york . think that &apos;s a way in a in cases per per per meter of dollars worth worth .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , a a a point when there was a pause , &quot; <unk> , &quot; paul , &quot; paul , we might look to look the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk is in very simple form that that a a a place is a place that &apos;s a a place that the beginning of the , , which is the the laws that which is there and and the people who to to either , either or or .
so , i was asked by the president of <unk> who said that we have to realize that we have to have this this , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way to bring our country .
i was asked to come to to and and and to the fourth and and the fifth of january .
so i &apos;ve had a with with facts that that that has a graph that has to to to to to you , if you want to make a much of it , a city , it has to be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch , the the the airport that was built in <unk> .
this airport has a surface of 100 <unk> .
so i &apos;ve trying to convince the <unk> of of you , you want to build a new city , you you to to start with an area of least 1,000 <unk> .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand percent .
polite have all the .
the the faces of the audience were very very , and attention .
the director of congress came to the stage and said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you very much for your talk , but could we look at the tedtalk tedtalk .
i have him on my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and i played the tedtalk .
and i came to the punch statement that a new city offers new new new new new .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that <unk> , , than hundreds of kilometers away in north north .
and a new city cities also also new opportunities for leaders leaders .
the leaders in the had been <unk> on the help from <unk> , they they could benefit from their <unk> , they they the the the the for the for this charter and and to think that that that the that the that the that the charter is going to .
and the realization of president <unk> , was that the <unk> of the <unk> of the i was thinking about a a a to get to get to to build the to be to be the to for all parties for the parties for many years and of the .
we &apos;re into a area .
this image is from this place .
it it &apos;s a thousand square miles .
and shortly after , , , she , she , she the the of the constitution to have a <unk> of for that that &apos;s special <unk> .
in a country , a have an intense crisis behind the congress , in congress to a voice to a voice .
all parties , all the <unk> of society , supported this .
to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved by congress . congress .
february , february , it was a second time to a <unk> to a voice .
immediately immediately after this choice , between the 21st of , , , , the delegation of about 30 of the the world the world that were most interested in the the of the into the business .
one is a south south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new center , which in south south south <unk> , <unk> big <unk> .
all you can see in this image , within four years , built after four years after it took to get the .
the other place that was really interested in urbanism is singapore .
there are been built two cities in china and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re seen it it , it &apos;s where we are today .
you &apos;ve already an <unk> ; and you already consider this to the second city .
it &apos;s already been working on a legal system that that allow participate to participate , and it &apos;s worked to be a a for a external legal system .
a country has has been offered to the supreme court to to the , the the the the the of the <unk> of the its <unk> .
also , <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they actually bring bringing funding .
one thing you know , as you saw , , , , , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
there are many many businesses who would like to come in america , especially in a place , a place , and there are many people who would like to live there .
all over the world , there &apos;s 700 million people who to say they would like to live in a a different place .
a million people leaving over and more over to the united states .
many of you are are forced to say , they are forced to go their families , and they have single , who have to money enough to make money and to afford .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s sometimes kids who are trying to find their parents , in some cases , in haven &apos;t seen seen any more .
so what &apos;s it for an idea to build to make a new new city in
or even even <unk> of these cities cities , or hundreds of these cities , or hundreds of all over the world ?
so what &apos;s it for an idea that that every family has a choice between multiple million that have in competition ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends from have been me to say , thank you ted .
do you know how many choices make you make a a a a ?
you know how many choices you make in a a a a a ?
i &apos;ve got a poll from over 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that <unk> a typical americans a a typical americans .
and was a a study of ceos in the that they saw the ceos .
and these scientists have been taking with these these ceo and this ceo ceo , and how much time they make decisions that relate to the themes .
and they found that this average ceo ceo is busy in week week .
each of these topics was of many , many smaller choices .
50 percent of their choices were been to or just just a nine minutes or less .
it &apos;s only about 12 percent of their decisions they needed an hour or more of their .
think about your own decisions .
you know how many choices you make in the nine minutes of the in the one hour of category ?
how well do you think , are you the to to the ?
today i want to talk about one of the biggest most of our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and about some kinds of kinds of kinds .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;ll ask you some questions , ask you to ask you , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise raise raise , because i i , just hand , if you want to burn a calories .
otherwise , please , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so , my first question is : is you are ready to do is to do something about the computer ? ?
thank you .
when i was a <unk> at stanford stanford , i went to this very very <unk> <unk> -- at at at that time he was really really .
it was a place that was called the <unk> .
this business , it was almost almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and and and and over 500 different of of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different ways -- and that was at a time we actually have <unk> <unk> .
i loved it to deal with this business ; but at one moment , i wondered , well , how do you get to do something ?
here &apos;s the olive olive . .
they had over 75 of olive oil oil including those who were were in were were were <unk> <unk> .
so i decided to day one day , and i asked the leader , &quot; work this model works that that you really have the people all of possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up the the of tourists that came and and usually had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose for our experiment for our experiment .
here &apos;s her <unk> gang .
they had <unk> different kinds of <unk> .
we &apos;ve set up a little <unk> right on the the the the the .
we have got to be six different tastes of <unk> or 24 various trials , and put put together , and we &apos;ve two two things : one , one , i mean , i mean , more people stand
it &apos;s more people , when it were 24 , roughly 60 percent when it were six , about 40 percent .
and then we we look at what people were actually were a a of a glass .
we we saw the reward effect .
by the people who were were been 24 , were only three percent of the <unk> .
by the people who were were six six , now , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of of . .
now , if you calculate it , the people people six more of a glass of , who they had six data , when they had 24 .
now , &apos;t buy a glass of of the , is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our our -- but it turns out that the <unk> that also also also us in very very powerful decisions .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , if it &apos;s against our best interests .
so the the subject of the day : value .
now i &apos;m going to describe a study that i &apos;m going to <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , in which we did the the to <unk> for for for a million million americans in the entire of of
and what we looked at was whether the number of the <unk> that that a a <unk> of , to be the the probability of the to be saved .
and we found that there was a connection in fact .
so in this plans , we had about <unk> plans , that the people who offered the people between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund offered offered that , in fact , was was in .
if you look at the extreme , the plans that offered the two fund offered had a <unk> in in the &apos; 70s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that were offered almost 60 fund , the the <unk> <unk> now in the <unk> .
now turns out that even if you take a <unk> of , if you were more opportunities to choices , even , it has negative consequences .
so people people who decided to participate , and to think that the more opportunities for them , the more they they release it , the the and and fund fund .
the more opportunities for them , the the , they they they they they they they &apos;re they they &apos;re they &apos;re in in pure .
none of these extreme decisions , to the decisions that would recommend if if if we were us physical physical resource .
now , in the last decade , we &apos;ve been the people of the to the to be the to the more more and more choices .
they they the decision decision -- push it up , even if it &apos;s against their own best .
they &apos;re more worse decisions -- worse financial and worse policy decisions .
they decide to decide to things that they they less less content , even if you make it objective .
the main reason for this is that we might have to to to this this this of these these these <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , but we , but we actually &apos;t actually the comparison and and , and actually actually can choose something from the
so what i want like to do today is four simple techniques techniques techniques that we test in different ways and different different different ways -- they can just be in in their business .
first : just .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it never never been true than today that less than today .
people are always concerned about i say , &quot; let &apos;s just &quot; &quot; . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried about they &apos;re losing .
but in truth , we &apos;re going to see it more and more that if you &apos;re ready to to to and the the <unk> of opportunities , , , now , there &apos;s a increase in sales , it &apos;s brought down the cost &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s no improvement
as a <unk> and , and the different <unk> and and and <unk> of 26 species even even a 15 , , it has been taken by by about 10 percent .
when the golden <unk> corporation of selling <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , , he &apos;d been that that the for percent percent percent -- a of both of the sales , the increase of the population has been been .
you know , the average average system today , you about about about our products .
so , your typical wal-mart offers to you today today .
but the <unk> supermarket , the the <unk> the world is <unk> , and they &apos;re them or a -- -- sort of tomato sauce in a .
now in the world of the , , i think one of the best examples that are recently come to the the the best the the best the the , was something that david <unk> has been a very , , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard .
now , every single leader who takes automatically to a <unk> part .
those who are really to meet a choice , 20 fund , , , not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to to be .
it &apos;s all important opportunity . &quot;
and the first thing i do is the say , &quot; tell me how the opportunity different from each other .
and if your employees couldn &apos;t <unk> them , it can &apos;t be their customers . &quot;
now , before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to all people people in this audience would be to to a <unk> <unk> , to the beautiful street of the world .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i &apos;d like to read you to read .
and now i give you a couple of seconds to read them and ask them to clapping when you &apos;re willing to take under .
okay . so , all of the , gary &apos;s . .
are they all ?
well , let me show you a little bit more of it .
she knew , was a trick , right ?
now , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i have a more hands .
all right .
in fact , that &apos;s a to be more information , the first time , the time , but i would take it to guess that you felt it it second real time .
because the pictures she had feel feel real .
what what to me to the second technique that you to to to with the problem of the , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about that people to understand the difference between opportunities understand understand what consequences are the the single effects , and that have have to be that and and that have to be felt .
why people spending average average average average 15 percent more if you use a card or a card card , , in cash ?
because it &apos;s not what we &apos;d say .
and it turns out that if you make it difference , it feels a good tool , it &apos;s a good tool to save people to save more .
so we &apos;ve been in a study that i made <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve made a study with the people -- employees employees employees -- employees , who worked all all the <unk> -- and those people were all been in a meeting in their their
and during this meeting , we &apos;ve the this this this as as as it was , just we &apos;ve a little little .
the small thing we we &apos;ve in the is that we were asked to to people to think about all the things things that would happen in their lives if they would save money .
in that , we we did this this simple , there was a increase in our own , 20 percent and there was a increase of the number of people who were ready to save or a increase in the percent of the the they were ready to pay for
the the : <unk> .
we can better more categories than more choices more more .
here &apos;s example , example , one study we &apos;ve in a a <unk> .
it turns out that it &apos;s in the <unk> <unk> and the down in the northeast , , between between different types of magazines to to level of
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines and you into 10 categories of <unk> , or i show you 400 magazines , and those in 20 categories , you think that i think you will give you more choice and a better <unk> , when i had the 400 to when i had them to you .
because the categories of what i can think of .
here are two different different of .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think that the left is ad , and the the ad on the the is , then clap in their hands .
okay , there &apos;s some . .
if you think that the the on the left is jazz and the , on the right side of <unk> , you clap .
okay , some more .
well , it turns out that they &apos;re right .
the the on the left is jazz and the on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a highly <unk> <unk> . .
the categories have to say something that is not the the of the .
and this problem is often you you , if you look at the long lists of all of these fund .
who are you going to be ? ?
my fourth technology : : : for complexity .
it turns out that we actually can be more information to more information than we think we &apos;re just to simplify them .
we need to increase to increase .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision , take a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> who who you the ability to your your car completely .
you &apos;ve got to make 62 different choices to make your car completely .
now , these choices are the number of choices that make you make choice .
<unk> , <unk> the car -- i <unk> .
motors , engines , support -- four choices .
what i do now , i change the order to come into the choices .
half of the is is going by the many , 56 <unk> , the the are four are .
the other half of the are are are are , , four these , , <unk> , , many .
what am i looking at ?
now , what are are .
if you use the the the the decision , that that that it &apos;s actually overwhelmed , the <unk> , , i losing it .
what you find out is that the people who are the the the the low <unk> , and over and again and again .
we lose them .
go from the little choice to the the many , then they stay in .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is that is the order to change the that information .
if i start with the simple , i &apos;m learning how i &apos;m .
even even though the have to pick up and &apos;t tell me about my preferences on the , , , it it me me , still me me .
it &apos;s me in the great of the great product that i &apos;m going to , and so i i ready to get to to to to to to be interested in .
let me take up .
i &apos;ve been told you four techniques that the problem of <unk> <unk> -- -- -- -- will go to the <unk> alternative ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; we can do better more categories , less than .
every one of these techniques that i &apos;m going to tell you about is to help help manage to manage -- -- good for you , you can use for themselves , for themselves , good for for people who they service .
because i think the key to the best possible possible is that you choose choose for the .
and the more we pick choose choose choose choose , the better will we be able to practice the art of decision .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> , youtube . when i look at <unk> . .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how video <unk> and then , , why it &apos;s important .
we all want to be star -- <unk> , , , airbus -- -- when i was young , it seemed to be too way .
but <unk> <unk> have able to do all of our creative creative activities , all our creative creative , , in part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be about the internet to be famous to next saturday .
but youtube , there will be more than 48 hours a a hours a minute .
and again , only will only have a tiny percentage of of the more than and and become thousands and thousands and and the cultural moment .
so how does that work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> , and unexpected .
well , we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year <unk> <unk> this video that was filmed in his house in national park .
2010 2010 , it had been been two million times .
this graph shows how it looked like it looked at the the the the the the the the the first time .
actually , &apos;t really wanted to make a video video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow rainbow .
because you &apos;re that you &apos;re doing it in a <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> .
he had a lot of <unk> . .
and this video was actually been being sent in january .
what &apos;s happened here ?
and came in jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> : the the the the the the the the
because <unk> <unk> like jimmy <unk> imagine us new and and things and and and and you &apos;re a big audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> get down down on <unk> . <unk> &apos;s <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . <unk> . .
rebecca <unk> is one of the most popular videos .
it &apos;s been a 200 million million million .
this is what the chart looked like .
just like &quot; &quot; &quot; double <unk> &quot; &quot; it seems to be out of the .
what &apos;s happened on this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you know , you know , these other are are are <unk> .
but what about this day , this this this ?
well , <unk> <unk> it , many blogs started to write about it .
michael j. nelson nelson nelson &apos;s science theater was one first that made a joke about twitter .
it &apos;s important that a person is a a person or a a a a a point of a , and a a big audience and <unk> process .
then this community was formed people who shared this big <unk> , , and started to talk about it and and it around with it .
now there &apos;s 10,000 <unk> of <unk> by youtube .
already in the first seven days there was a a of of every day of day .
unlike the <unk> of the 20th century , the is the of of our our our path to become part of the phenomenon -- either we &apos;re actually going to spread it or something new
&quot; <unk> <unk> is animation and music is in <unk> .
that &apos;s it , simple .
this year it &apos;s almost 50 million million times .
and if you do that for crazy , you should know that there is a <unk> of , , four million times .
and even cats , this video .
cats say to say , cats , the that this video .
the important is that is creativity that that &apos;s in the <unk> of the and and <unk> .
there were actually . .
someone was a an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
one entire entire <unk> case , from the ground that made it from a stupid joke , what we can do .
today we don &apos;t just find to pleasure of something , we do with .
who would have have this to anticipate anything ?
who would have &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; predictions ?
what are you would would be you to be in that kind of <unk> ?
in a world where every minute two of video is being uploaded , only really unique and unexpected unexpected how how the video video video .
i i &apos;m not i was not very i i i said to i should look at this great video , a guy , on a new york , for the on on the .
i got a ticket ticket because i i not on the <unk> of , but there &apos;s a lot of disabilities that doesn &apos;t really properly on the the .
because it was a very surprising and and , , casey is a funny idea and and his argument , and it &apos;s been at five million times .
this approach is true to anything new that we &apos;re creative .
and all of us leads to a big question .
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative , , completely unexpected , the features of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access and and the the audience the audience .
as i said , one of the greatest stars stars -- justin bieber -- he gave his beginning to youtube .
nobody one needs to give your ideas green lights .
and today we we &apos;re all of our of our culture .
and these are not the of the old media and they &apos;re also not going to be to the the media , but they will going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how , i i in in about about about the about three generations , and as the amazing strength of this argument is a four percent girl &apos;s in a <unk> girl , her mother and her mother and and his mother and a a in a little little girl in a little girl in a little girl in a a little girl in a a little girl in a a little girl in a a little girl in a a little girl in a a little girl in a a little girl in
the &apos;s not yet .
it &apos;s a puzzle of which is actually being put together .
i want to tell you about some of the most <unk> .
imagine the first piece : : a man who &apos;s his his work .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose life is a whole of of of of of and to his own home .
now , you the the the <unk> of the <unk> in front of the <unk> , how how to admit that his life was a a a of a .
the words , as long as his friends , <unk> <unk> .
he moved to the silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never got me to forget .
i had to worry that it was not free , and it was my job to learn that that story was absolutely tried to to us , we &apos;ll come through it .
the next next <unk> , , a boat in the early on the the sea , <unk> .
my mother may 18 18 18 she was her father -- already in a a marriage , already two little girls .
for her , her life had a task : : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely easy that they could fail .
after a four four and <unk> <unk> <unk> a boat on the lake , as <unk> .
all adults were were aware of the risk .
the biggest fear had the , , rape and death .
as most adults on the boat was wearing a little <unk> in .
in a <unk> , my sister and i , i , and i , and my grandmother .
my first memories are there -- the &apos;s always horrible <unk> of the engine , clapping each wave on the front place , the large and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates to get many of , , but the the of the the of the men on the the of the the engine , not &apos;t to to start six hours .
but i remember the lights on the lights of the <unk> coast of the , and the young man who broke down and and , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the the of the first <unk> , which was one of the men
no apple gets so <unk> .
after three months in the refugee camp we landed in in in .
and the next <unk> is about four of three generations that build up a new life .
we we down in <unk> , , one from the most famous famous about the population of the population .
unlike the <unk> <unk> , whose <unk> whose ever been completely unknown , there was no <unk> in <unk> .
the smells from the <unk> came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> were broken broken <unk> between people who had had a thing in common : they they had new .
my mother worked on farms on this one one one in a <unk> line , six days , , days , twice .
and it did able to find the time english and <unk> .
we were poor .
any dollar was given to be given to in education for english and math , no matter what we had to make to the , most of the new things that came came from hand .
two couple of <unk> for school , to to the to the the other .
it &apos;s a <unk> to to the <unk> , because she had to be six years .
and there were the rare , but they have the <unk> of &quot; and here and here and there <unk> , &quot; <unk> , go home . &quot;
when where ?
something little more <unk> in me .
there was a a reconciliation and a a little voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept at the same bed .
my mother was every night every night , but we told each other each other , and heard heard the movements of our grandmother &apos;s house .
my mom suffered from from the boat .
and it was my job to stay up every night , until until her <unk> came to , so i could it .
she opened a <unk> , , then a <unk> and opened a <unk> .
and the women came with with stories about men who don &apos;t &apos;t <unk> , angry and <unk> and <unk> children , and , , between two worlds .
loans and donors were gone .
centers were built .
i lived in <unk> .
in one was , in a classic asian asian student , the <unk> of of himself .
in the other , i &apos;ve been involved in insecure , the tragic scars of violence talking about violence , and the .
but so many of the the help .
and because of the help , i was been in my last year of the <unk> <unk> year .
and i was been to from one <unk> to the the , and the doesn &apos;t fit the edges .
<unk> le , anonymous <unk> of <unk> , was <unk> le le , refugee and social activist who invited to speak of talks to the , and she had never ever heard of them .
i didn &apos;t familiar with the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back and and the comfort of life of a unknown <unk> -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who who were around for their days as <unk> as they told them , and the stories of their day , and we still in the same bed .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was so old , as was how as we climbed the boat .
no , never been a opportunity .
&quot; just do it &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t you don &apos;t . &quot;
so i spoke about <unk> and education , and the <unk> of the and <unk> .
and the more i i talked talking about , the more i should tell .
i met people in all the <unk> , so many of you did what they loved loved , lived in the boundaries of the possible .
and even though i had to that i i i couldn &apos;t know that with a career in the .
there was another another <unk> .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a twist , a <unk> , , a <unk> , in the picture -- not just , , but something that you have to be grateful for you , maybe a gift of the .
because <unk> can be so easily to to collapse in the while , so easy that you that the numbers of the environment .
now i &apos;ve gone enough of my my <unk> to know that , yes , the world world , but not as you &apos;re it .
possibilities that weren &apos;t allowed , were explicitly .
there there was a energy , a an <unk> optimism , a strange <unk> of humility and the .
so i followed my feeling feeling .
i collected a little team of people around me , &quot; not &quot; &quot; not a a <unk> challenge . &quot;
a year we didn &apos;t have a a a year .
and i i cooking , i i &apos;m a large of of of soup we shared .
we worked up late late night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a brilliant brilliant , and we managed to build the breakthrough .
i i the the decision to the u.s.
after only a journey there .
my put my gut .
three months later , i was moved moved and the adventure .
before i talk to the talk , i &apos;d like to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up to a time , in the social norm and the local english english was the most important .
life didn &apos;t changed any centuries . centuries .
her father died after a time .
her mom mom alone .
by 17 , she was a by a phone mother mother mother mother mother . her mother .
and if man man was worried about her man &apos;s <unk> , by <unk> it to the and <unk> in her own case , and one even more bigger than she won
&quot; not &apos;t really that that was <unk> .
i just <unk> in in a hotel room in sydney , she died . 1,000 miles away in in .
i looked through the <unk> and and and i saw on the other side .
i knew she had come to to come to .
my mother called me a a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist buddhist temple in <unk> and sat in their <unk> .
we told their stories and <unk> , we were still in .
and midnight midnight , the &apos; monk , said , he must close the
my mother asked us to touch your hand .
she asked the sunday , &quot; why is your your your your and your your your is so hot ? &quot;
&quot; because she &apos;s &quot; &quot; because she said , &quot; he said .
&quot; you don &apos;t put it . &quot;
if you have a a , in our family , it &apos;s it &apos;s through the .
you see , who we were and how life has been shaped , we can see that the men that might be in our lives , were going to come to us .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now , i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i think think of the boat .
who would ever want one ?
yeah , i was afraid of privilege , by ease , <unk> .
can i give you a bug in your life , the brave every <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , , being <unk> , the the , , the , the , that
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this this , and i could be it it , i would do it .
and also , <unk> is in the fourth fourth of here in the fourth fourth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it at all ?
because this is a picture of of course , you can &apos;t &apos;t look at your camera .
and yet , my interested in photography when i got my first camera camera , age 15 years old .
i put it with my former <unk> for for draw , but it was a little different , because the the camera was actually the process of planning .
and if you take a picture of a camera with a camera , the process of if you keep on the trigger .
so for me , it seemed to be to to to to be at the right place at the right place at the right time .
i i , i could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts to begin with the process when the trigger is going .
pictures like this : a lot along a a <unk> road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and <unk> still a realistic level .
or pictures like this -- dark and <unk> , but everybody with shared goal , keep a realistic level .
if i say , i &apos;m going to .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you really really work , but i want like to look it it like this , if you could have this , you
photos where you have to think a a moment to to see the trick .
so it &apos;s more about capture an idea , as a really a moment .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it make it ?
is it about the details , or the colors ?
is about that light ?
what does the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but the end , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how can can it can be able to be on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not what realistic is realistic , but what we think about realistic .
so i think the are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality , which you can take different pieces and and to put together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfectly <unk> of physical objects that we can all identify with a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way of combined , it can create something that &apos;s still in in in , as if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that that &apos;s not possible .
so we <unk> our brains , because our brain is simply not not really that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process of the in the .
it &apos;s really just about to different realities .
so the things that make a image realistic realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , things around us around us .
but if we combine it , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because else you just look wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow to get a <unk> result .
as you can see , it &apos;s not three special images .
it &apos;s combined , it can do something something like this .
so the first rule is that put photos photos have same perspective perspective .
two , two would have together the same <unk> .
and these two these two these these two these two , the same height , and the same same way .
third , it &apos;s about to make it impossible to tell the individuals where the individual images start and end by making them out . .
it &apos;s impossible to say how this photo was actually put together .
so by color color , contrast contrast the the edges , the the , , , , , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , , and , and , and , and , and , a single picture , even a a a picture of of of have a a .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that this is just a landscape landscape , and the bottom was <unk> .
this picture is actually , in fact , together , from of different places .
i personally , i think it &apos;s easier easier to find a place to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to leave with with the ideas in his head .
but it &apos;s a lot planning .
and when i had this idea of the winter , i knew that i &apos;d needed several months to get them to find out the the of the .
for example , fish was been on a <unk> . .
the bank comes from from one place .
the <unk> was comes from a <unk> .
and yeah , i actually got the the home at the island of red , to look it down the of of it .
so to get a a result , it &apos;s going to come from me from my .
i always start with a <unk> , , one idea .
after that , it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
and here &apos;s every piece of very well .
and then you &apos;re good good images , the result can be pretty beautiful , and it &apos;s pretty realistic .
so it &apos;s all there , and the only thing that might be able to us is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic <unk> fail fail .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we &apos;ve on the <unk> is to do a <unk> .
and it &apos;s not about about , in a scientific scientific -- you think about a cup of coffee or tea , and the the patients , families , families , relatives , &quot; how how are going
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems that all -- all -- maybe maybe most of the electronic <unk> fail fail : because we stopped listening .
this is my <unk> . . a very simple thing .
it &apos;s got a button .
and every time i jump into it .
and yeah , i have a task , you might recognize .
i have <unk> this job on 95 pounds .
it works simply works , every time i start into the scale , you send your data back to google .
and there &apos;s also be <unk> by my <unk> <unk> , so he can see where my <unk> is is , and it &apos;s not just the moment that i &apos;m going to do , or if i need to do a look at the past , but also with a look at the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you &apos;re familiar familiar with , i &apos;ve been on 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning i turn into my <unk> and and people talk to me before i sit in the car , &quot; lunch , &quot; lunch , just a a a a a today , <unk> . &quot;
but this is the <unk> thing that what can happen because this is the <unk> , , to help patients , help patients , because could be used against obesity or or it could be <unk> to smoke .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and bring them to play any kind of play to control their health .
next next week , it &apos;s the market .
there &apos;s be this little <unk> of that you &apos;re going to be an iphone or or <unk> .
and it will allow people to measure their blood blood pressure blood pressure to the doctor and him for him to share for for a more than 100 .
at this point , the the come into the game . you can &apos;t just take control over back to their own , , , but can help help us the the the of the challenges that are in in us , and the the health care , and and so on .
they make the easy to use , and and to to this to give you patients to a team .
and you can achieve that these ways , but also by by .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done is i want to share with you a quick clip .
we &apos;ve all all the <unk> in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know exactly where all where all machines are are around around around .
we know one , we know , one of where all stations stations .
and clear , we can find <unk> .
but where would the next <unk> to help help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
no one knew where the next life-saving life-saving <unk> in this moment .
so , what did we do ? we did this in the netherlands .
we put a website and a a and a <unk> asked , &quot; if you see a <unk> , , please share share where he &apos;s , &quot; because he &apos;s because he &apos;s because , because , as , as closed , , course .
and there are been 10,000 <unk> in the netherlands .
the next step was to find these apps .
and we &apos;ve designed a <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed an app for <unk> , which is extended reality , to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> <unk> and someone will be , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks , your <unk> , to find the the the the the to save the .
and we want to to this today , we don &apos;t just like this , as the product product is called , but it &apos;s also .
and we want to bring this in a worldwide .
and we ask our colleagues in all around the world , from from other universities , to help us to to to the how to <unk> the the world the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation and someone &apos;s going to , whether it &apos;s your own or or anybody else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies all around the world are helping us all the the world of this <unk> .
these could be <unk> , or or , or , for example , just to make sure that the <unk> is still still in its place .
please , ask us to do and try to improve the health , not just to to , but to take it .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to tell learned about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the <unk> .
and my little <unk> , that want us to force us to environment , by ... ...
it &apos;s to get to .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may take it it &apos;s <unk> .
now -- we can just just -- -- i &apos;m just going to throw the video .
no .
this is not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i launched a program to get the star and and design to a year when and work and work in a environment that which is pretty much what you &apos;re actually doing , we &apos;ve got them in government government .
the program is called for america for america , and it &apos;s a bit like the <unk> .
we choose a couple of fellows and we &apos;ll them them with <unk> .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them in in <unk> .
and there developed a amazing apps , working with urban <unk> .
but what you really do is to show what &apos;s possible to do with technology .
so they meet al al .
al is a <unk> in the city .
here it looks like if he looks after a date , but what he really is , is somebody who &apos;s really , , when it &apos;s <unk> , because he knows it &apos;s not very good at the <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> by the <unk> .
how did he go to look for this particular particular way ?
and last year , we had a team of fellows in boston with the called the &quot; program for america . &quot;
they were in in february , and it has been a lot of <unk> .
and they noticed that the city was never <unk> these <unk> fire .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik <unk> , , even something else , and that was that the the for the for for the for the , directly .
so he did what every good of do do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a mystery .
you &apos;re <unk> to <unk> it , it &apos;s <unk> .
if you do that , you can give it name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little dynamic game .
this is a little little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest <unk> of 21 apps that have been in in last last year .
but she does something that no other <unk> does .
it &apos;s producing rapidly .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> the the city of the city , which has seen that use this app , not for snow , but to the the the the .
it &apos;s very important that this <unk> work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check it .
and then , seattle , to use the app to use the citizens to clean the the <unk> .
and chicago has introduced it to the the people the the <unk> <unk> when it &apos;s <unk> .
now we know nine cities , the planning to use this app .
and it has accessible , organic , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know , it &apos;s not usually going on .
the software of software takes a a few years .
we had a team , last year in a project in in in the , for three people and months .
it was a way of a to find out the parents , the the right public schools are the kids are .
we later later , that if it would go over the water , it took over two two years , it would have taken over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing .
there &apos;s a project in the california justice justice , which has the the the total one to two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there &apos;s projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spreading by by the , is a kind of shot on the front of the .
you can tell the the government work better -- not longer like a private private company , how many people think that should .
and not even like a <unk> , , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means open open open open that means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , on this app is that that you represents a new generation that which the the the government -- not as the problem of an institution institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out that we &apos;re very good in the collective technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who create tools that we need to make things together things together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , there are hundreds of people all over the country that get up and <unk> and , every day in their communities .
they didn &apos;t have up the government .
they &apos;re terribly frustrated with her , but they didn &apos;t complain about it , they repair them .
and these people know something we &apos;ve lost out of the eyes .
and that &apos;s , if you all all of your feelings about politics and the snake of the and all the other things that we really upset about , is , in the , in the , in the , in the , , , &apos; , , &quot; what we do we do &apos;t do . &quot;
it &apos;s got a lot of people people to the government .
and if you &apos;re one of the people , please , you you know you &apos;re about about it because the things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change change ; government is in change .
and because the government actually actually takes your power -- <unk> you , &quot; &quot; we we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , how we think about how this change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know a lot about the , when i started this program .
and how many people , i thought that it was in the government to to a office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the that it &apos;s especially in communities , <unk> .
this is the call center center for service and information .
you you usually get out when you &apos;re in your city .
if you &apos;ve got chance to work in the work in the center of my our fellow scott scott <unk> as part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re all -- you you &apos;re going to see that the the government of the have in a lot of problems in your house .
scott gets this <unk> .
he type &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; in the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the <unk> .
and finally he says , &quot; look , you can just all the doors in your house and open your your and play and and and see if the livestock is ? &quot;
and that worked . applause .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> .
boston has not just a call call .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , called <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we don &apos;t have this app .
this is the work very smart people in the office of the new urban urban <unk> .
one day , this is an actual report -- this is what it was saying , &quot; <unk> in my <unk> , cannot say if it &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what happens is is a different .
scott was from from human being .
but on &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is all public , so everybody can see .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next one that we get get , &quot; i went over there , found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . alive ?
and the the the side . went home . went home .
good night , cute . . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . this is the digital the physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how government is to get into this .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m talking to talk about a platform for people to help help help and help others .
a a citizens helped a different citizens , but the government was a a a .
they connected these these two people .
and you &apos;d have able them to make you create , if that , but a neighbor is a a a better and cheaper alternative to government services .
if you helps your other , we can our communities communities .
we call the <unk> , , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand this , but they think that &apos;s one of the input input .
that our contribution to the system is .
how often we have elected a political leaders -- and sometimes we &apos;ve used a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we call back and we we expect that the government , our values and and needs doesn &apos;t change much ?
this is because the government is a a and and politics is the the <unk> <unk> .
and what &apos;s below is that what we call call bureaucracy .
and we use this word such contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt , which this thing that we own and for we pay for paying to to be something that &apos;s against us , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think politics politics .
if we want this institution for us , we have to make that , we have to sexy debris .
because this is where the real is is going on .
we need to be to to the the government .
so the <unk> has done it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of more concerned that wrote a very detailed architect report that &apos;s an answer to the <unk> of the the <unk> .
that &apos;s not politically active , that is is active active .
well , for those of us who have the government , it &apos;s time that we think about about about the world that we want to leave our children .
you &apos;ve got to imagine the enormous challenges of the to ask you .
do we really think that we we to do we have to reach without the to a an institution that can &apos;t all of us in the of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology is possible that technology , the the the government has fundamentally in in a way that actually achieve something that has a society society .
and there &apos;s one generation that has grown up the the internet , and knows that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you &apos;ve got to build it just to .
now the average age of our are is 28 , so unfortunately , , , , almost , almost a generation of you .
this is a generation that grew up to to your voice of granted .
they &apos;re not fight fight that we all fight to who are to to speak ; they all be .
you can make your mind , every every event every time , and they do it .
so if you &apos;re faced with the government , they don &apos;t care about their their voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that that the the work of government .
and these apps are our use our hands to improve our communities communities .
this might be a a fire fire , <unk> a <unk> , a <unk> turn to a <unk> .
and sure , we have have these these <unk> up all the time , and a lot of people do .
but these apps are like little little memories memories that we are not only consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers government that are paying paying to pay taxes .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we will not improve the government , until we make the citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve all all of you here : : if it &apos;s about big big , important things we need to do together , all together , we will going to be a lot of of , , or will we going to be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually , my role in people to explain how wonderful the new technologies that are the to be the the are going to be , and i thought i i was here , i i would tell you , and i really do what i really think about , and , and to see what &apos;s really going on , and , and what i really do to do is to to see what &apos;s really going on , and what i
i &apos;m going to start by just to show you a only say just a a boring slide .
please you just for just briefly .
this is a slide that i draw by from my my folder .
i &apos;m not about the details of the slide , but it &apos;s sort of the the the .
this slide this slide , data of of us of the the performance of <unk> processors are going to the performance area of an area area .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , the one of the others , which we find find find in in our field , a a kind of a on a <unk> curve .
in other words , each step here is a power of the <unk> .
and this is a novelty , that we need to use this guy on a <unk> in in the area of technology technology .
something stuff happening here .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you can lights lights again .
even more because because i &apos;m going to draw something in the paper here .
now why do we draw graphs under the in in technology ?
the reason for that is if i put it on a normal curve , where , where , say , here , here &apos;s the the the the , so the the of a kind of , , and this is an equal amount of of technology that i want to to a
they &apos;ll look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record a different technology , say , let &apos;s say a a <unk> , , it would be a a a <unk> , in a a form of a flat line .
but if something happens like this , it &apos;s changes the <unk> .
so if the <unk> of the would be the the the , , then we could get into into a taxi and and in in a million seconds , we were in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not that quickly .
this was never been in the history of the history of the , , this kind of <unk> growth , the order of the is now increase in exponentially .
and the question i &apos;d like to ask you is is if you look at this exponential curves , you don &apos;t go to it forever .
it &apos;s not possible that it &apos;s forever forever and and now quickly now now .
there are two options : there are two possibilities .
either it &apos;s either a a classic <unk> of of this , like here , to a new , or or it &apos;s going to happen .
that &apos;s it &apos;s about it .
now , i am an optimist , so i think i think something like this in the way that &apos;s going to happen .
it &apos;s really that , it means that we &apos;re here right now in the right now in the moment .
we &apos;re on this line , in this line , in a world world from world world world to a new new kind of world .
so , the question i want to ask , and i often think of it , as a lot of the new world will be ?
what &apos;s this new state that just the the world ?
because the transition seems very to be very confusing , you know , you &apos;re in inside the inside .
and when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 , and the people often often talked about what what would happen in the year 2000 .
now now we &apos;ve got a conference here conference where people talk about the future , and you find that the future is still in the year .
keep on , we don &apos;t go .
so in other words , the future has increased year year since since i was in this world .
and i think the reason why is that we &apos;re that there is something that &apos;s going on .
the transition is . we can feel it .
and we know that right now , there &apos;s no sense to do to give to 30 or 50 years , because it &apos;s going to be so different , that &apos;s a simple way that that we can &apos;t make a sense of what we
so i want to talk now about what that could be this this this is where we &apos;re at moment .
so to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some of some other things that really do with technology or computers .
because i think to understand this really , we need to step back and step back and look at the thing on a longer .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at this on the earth &apos;s life of life .
i think think think think all of sense sense of you can <unk> it in a <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and we &apos;re a billion billion years , and the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> <unk> chemicals in lots of lots of <unk> chemicals .
now if you look at these these , , these chemicals were organized , then , that &apos;s a pretty good picture about how they the the .
i think there &apos;s there &apos;s theories that start to to to things like all all of , but i &apos;m going to tell you a little of of which is that little little <unk> <unk> <unk> , which are different kinds of <unk> of <unk> in .
some of these <unk> <unk> had a special combination of of chemicals which they allowed them to provide the other chemicals from the outside and grow .
they all were the , of the .
these little <unk> were in the sense of the <unk> .
but , these <unk> , not about about living in the world &apos;s , because every single one of them was just a little , <unk> recipe of chemicals .
and every time it shared , they were <unk> chemicals into these more disparate of of .
so every single one of a little bit different .
in fact , the <unk> , which had a <unk> <unk> <unk> that would faster more and more and more chemicals and more chemicals and more chemicals , and .
so this is the u.s. to survive longer , and they had <unk> into the extent .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting it &apos;s going to be if this <unk> is a trick of an abstraction .
in any way , we don &apos;t understand understand understand , this is the ability to have the ability to <unk> information .
they learned learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and in a particular chemical form that which we call dna dna .
in other words , they have in this <unk> , , a way way that allowed them to them , they made them , so that that information has saved and copied .
and the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information about the the time of two billion years , which she had developed , right .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , from exactly same same code and the same notation .
and that is the same that is that same same same and and same code .
we &apos;re far far that we can only be to to the <unk> , , in this code .
and i &apos;ve got 100 100 <unk> of a white <unk> , which i &apos;m trying to keep in the in the airports .
in is -- what i did is i &apos;ve done this is , i took this code -- the code is the art of -- which we use the <unk> -- and i wrote my <unk> on a piece of dna , and i <unk> it more than
so if somebody wants to take a hundred million copies of my <unk> , i &apos;ve got enough for anyone in this room and even for everybody in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
i would have been a <unk> <unk> , , i would have had a a virus and and it it in the space .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna of dna was was a interesting step .
and the <unk> cells -- this -- that made it happy for another billion years .
but then another one , really , very interesting , , where the things were completely different , and which is they started communicate and communicate information information , so that communities of cells out of cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew it , but bacteria actually act their dna .
that &apos;s why why is the the -- for example , the .
and some bacteria have found out how to stay from , and and have taken this information together with other bacteria , and we &apos;ve written and and , and we have a lot of bacteria , which are resistant to penicillin , because the
now , this communication that allowed the communities that were in in the same boat in the same boat ; they were <unk> .
so they have survive together , or they they together together , they they had , that that if a community was successful , all the individuals of community community over and and and by .
now the the <unk> is now where these communities are close to <unk> that they decided to make the recipe for the whole community to the the community .
and the next thing is about another , about another billion years .
at that point , we have <unk> communities communities , communities many communities <unk> <unk> , which together together as single organism together .
in fact , we &apos;re also a such a <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that aren &apos;t asked for alone .
your skin cells are useless cells cells cells cells cells cells cells cells , cells and so on .
so these communities started to be so that the level of the place that evolution was not longer the the single cell , but the whole of the , which we call organism organism .
now next step is now within this communities .
the the <unk> started to to to .
and they developed a structure that which nothing else made information to process information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the neurons that have built up the <unk> .
they started to within specialists within the community , special structures which were responsible for learning , understand understand and understand that .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of this communities .
this was a an evolutionary advantage .
because at that point , because at this time , -- learn happened within the time of life of life of of single organism , rather than about this evolutionary period .
so , organism organism could learn to learn a a of of of not because she she she she she she she she sick , the last time he ate it .
now , this could be within within life lifetime of a single organism , across thousands of years were been took , because that this information was to to be by the individuals who died because of these fruit , because these <unk> were not not there .
so the nervous system has the <unk> using this special special , , because evolution could now be within an individual .
it could be a time of time time .
what what happened after that , that individual organisms have been a way to communicate each other .
for example , the <unk> , the <unk> of this <unk> is the the of the .
it &apos;s a amazing amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , , and , and like like my my my head .
i &apos;m &apos;m sitting here and and in the , of of of me , in hope to a a idea to to a a to to in your head that a a of my face with my original idea .
so we take a very complicated , it transform it into sound , a sequence of sound sound , and it &apos;s something very complicated to the your head .
so this is allowed us to to now to a an unified organism .
and what we actually did is we we , we , we started to be .
we go through the same levels that have gone through through the present -- the abstraction of our methods we can , , , , .
the invention of language was a little step into this direction .
<unk> , computers , computers , <unk> , and so on our are our are our for these are our community that we can handle in our community .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and also able able to evolve faster than we were in .
so today , evolution can happen at time time .
you &apos;ve also seen <unk> little <unk> , where he showed a little evolution in the &quot; <unk> &quot; right right to your eyes .
so , we have the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the first steps of history , which i told you , a billion years a half a half a half .
the next steps , how the nervous system , the brain , <unk> a hundred million years .
then the steps steps , like language language , so on , less than a million years .
and the next steps , like electronics like like very few decades , seem very few decades .
the process is feed itself itself itself , and i think , , , the word is the word for it -- if something that it &apos;s .
the more it changes , the faster changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that itself itself . itself .
i live living by a lot of computers , and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism to build computers , not use computers , not use , without the , that has been in in computing technologies .
my current activity is is designing objects with a lot of complexity that that it impossible to me to design that in a traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor in the <unk> .
it &apos;s billions of those .
what i do instead , and what do the designers do the <unk> of thinking , we think of a certain <unk> , , this this machine , and this machine power is to make this way that we could able to reach our skills , better and more and faster than
and she makes it part of methods that we don &apos;t even understand understand .
one way of which is interesting interesting , which i &apos;ve been used for recently , very recently , evolution is evolution .
and we put a a <unk> in in the machine that &apos;s happening in the <unk> .
to try an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that had from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , &quot; , a hundred million three three three three instructions .
now , you &apos;ll take , ready to join the instructions , all of the programs , and then end end of those who are the are the are the next . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to sort of number , that would be a simple example of what i &apos;ve already had .
so , simple that most likely to have likely to figure out .
of course , the chance of course , the had very small that they &apos;re a numbers of certain that you will not be the the .
but one of those might be two numbers of two numbers in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , , you &apos;ll take 10 percent of sequences sequences that my my are the next few .
these are , <unk> the rest .
now , all the <unk> that the numbers have the best best .
and it &apos;s a with a method of <unk> , analog to the . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children through the exchange of their <unk> , and the children are the the of the of the two programs of two programs .
now , i &apos;ve got a new generation of programs that made by combinations of combinations of programs which are closer closer to the things that are other other .
tell , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
<unk> it again .
maybe some mutations .
and trying to do that again , with a different generation .
all of these generations might only few milliseconds milliseconds
and so i can go through a evolution in the computer in a computer in a less than a , or in complicated cases .
so i i get programs that can be numbers perfect .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i ever ever ever .
and then when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell how they work .
i tried to understand it .
they are <unk> and and it &apos;s
but they do do it .
i know , i know , i &apos;m sure that you do do it because they come from a series of <unk> programs that come from a number of <unk> programs that have done
because your life was on the job , doing it right .
and i sat in a a 747 with a marvin cannot , a a <unk> , and he he a map , and says , &quot; oh look . look at that .
and is , &apos; plane is <unk> <unk> , which together work together to make their safer safer . &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
we know that a <unk> is not a , becomes complicated .
so we start starting to on computer , for a process that is different from classical engineering engineering .
it allows us to do things with a much higher complexity as it would allow the to produce .
and yet yet , understand the possibilities of it yet .
so , <unk> the technology .
we use these programs now to make the computer much faster , so that we can able to do these processes more able to do that processes .
so it &apos;s a a <unk> . .
it &apos;s faster faster and faster and and i think that &apos;s why it seems seems like that .
because all these new technologies from themselves itself itself itself .
we put up on .
we &apos;re at a point where analog is to to , as a <unk> to be <unk> .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t even even what the hell what the hell are we are in the .
we &apos;re in the middle of this <unk> .
but i really believe that there is something that .
i think it &apos;s very <unk> of us to say that we are the product of evolution .
and i think we all think of these are part of creation of whatever &apos;s going on .
now , lunch , and i think i &apos;ll hear here here before i i &apos;ll be .
my story is beginning to this in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the <unk> under the <unk> under the <unk> of ali .
we talked about that nothing has been changed since the time of ancient indian indian <unk> . &quot;
if we wanted to travel indians , we we down into a car and <unk> across the sky .
now we &apos;re going to get this with airplanes .
when the great indian <unk> thirst , , he took a bow , took the ground , fall into the ground and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with <unk> and and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic has been replaced with machines .
so that really made me sad .
i was a little bit of technology .
i i fear i could lose the ability to lose the , , and can eat , without a camera and without tweet my friends .
i found that technology should make magic possible and kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little <unk> <unk> .
this piece of 50 years old technology was the most <unk> thing to me .
she became an <unk> access to a world of pirates and <unk> ships and to images in my imagination .
i was it , like , , we were that sending our sending down to dreams .
they were to to be inspired by us .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic magic than kill .
with 16 , i started to illustrate books books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a storytelling , to see the reader that can connect the throughout the world .
it can know how we keep .
it can know where we are .
it take pictures and text and and animation , sound and touch . touch .
so the always always always always more .
but what are we doing to do ?
i &apos;m just going to <unk> , an interactive ipad app .
it says , &quot; let &apos;s put your finger on your light . &quot;
and so here says , &quot; this box is ... &quot; i write my name . &quot;
and i &apos;s a character in the book .
and again , a little back to me down -- and the ipad white white by gps where i live -- -- is really to me me .
and the child in me is really really excited about such a thing .
i &apos;ve a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t take any box and <unk> , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all were all children .
fireflies in a glass , i always found all the exciting .
so , you have to take the ipad out and fireflies fireflies .
and the are on the the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can be in in a single <unk> .
and therefore , every book and every book and every world , i i a little little <unk> that i leave here to the the device .
and that opens up a map .
<unk> had always had maps , but these maps were static .
and that map and and and and and to to to actually to to the to the the rest of the book .
it &apos;s also them in other of the book .
i &apos;m going to go here .
and it &apos;s to me to do something that is that that <unk> is is also very <unk> .
these are the <unk> . .
we &apos;ve all heard about <unk> and <unk> , but how many people people outside india known their people from the indian people who ?
the poor were were were thousands of years in <unk> , in an old <unk> book .
and we bring them back , in a story story for children .
a story that &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , as the <unk> .
the the theme , , a big problem , a big problem of the last 10 years is that children in their rooms , their home , , without getting out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book , you will sent to a search . you need to go out and and the the of the the images of natural images .
and i had a child , i had <unk> of <unk> stones , rocks , <unk> .
they do not do the children .
this is <unk> <unk> . you need to go out to go to a a picture of a flower .
in another chapter , you have to have a piece of <unk> and tag .
so , actually , you actually make a digital collection of pictures that you can then you can .
a child in london , this picture of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , today , i &apos;ve a a fox . &quot;
a child in india said , &quot; now , i &apos;ve a monkeys . &quot;
it creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of options that connect the world and technology to connect .
in the next book , we &apos;re an interaction with the the to the the and through through through <unk> reality , a animation of <unk> that appear on a plant plant .
one place , the the screen leaves leaves leaves .
you have to make the sound of the <unk> , you blow it and read the rest of the book .
we all move us to a world where the nature of of technology will come closer and and the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and closer to the natural world and and the magic , and the the love of our childhood through the simple medium of story story .
thank you .
this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prisons or or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with the global , in the <unk> and places places where there are a much necessarily .
here at ted , to see and hear how stimulating it is , me a very much .
in the short time , i realized , one thing : ted has a identity .
you can say things that have the world .
and sometimes if something about ted gets , it meaning meaning meaning and power that doesn &apos;t have otherwise .
i say that because i think that identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some real <unk> .
i think we &apos;ve learned that words of the teacher wanted a teacher , but the words of a dedicated meaningful meaningful meaningful meaningful meaningful meaningful .
you can do good . . you can do a lot of , but you can do more . .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional <unk> <unk> household that has been by by a <unk> , and and this <unk> was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , , strong wife she had effect .
she had the last word in every single . .
it was also a lot of our our our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in the <unk> in virginia .
it was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped a very way .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also known as well .
if i met them as a little boy , came up to me and and me .
she hit me that that i could barely breathe . then she would go .
one or two hours later , when i saw her , came up , and she said , &quot; <unk> , you know , you &apos;re even feel my embrace ?
and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; she said , again , if i said , &quot; yes , she &apos;d me me .
and it was something that made something that made to be near .
the only problem that it was 10 children had been 10 .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins fell around everywhere .
i remember i have eight or nine to have had up woke up one morning and the the came in the . all my cousins fell around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the <unk> and at at me .
first , i thought that that would be a game .
i looked at her and smiling , but she looked very seriously .
this was 15 or 20 minutes . then she stood up and she came over and she she she back to me and she said , &quot; come on , and i said , &quot; come , , you , and i , we &apos;ve got to talk
i remember it was it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out with and said , &quot; i , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;ll tell you something , but you got to promise you you &apos;re not <unk> it . &quot;
i said , &quot; i , i , . &quot;
she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down me and and i said , she said , &quot; i want you to see you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
and then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise to me three things , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , i .
she said , &quot; first , me , you you to to your mom always to love your &quot; . &quot;
she said , &quot; mom &apos;s my mom , and you must to to you to promise you you &apos;re always going to care . &quot;
i my my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , i said , &quot; i , i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; next , , me , you always do the right thing to do , &quot; even though it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , and i said , &quot; yes , i . . i promise . &quot;
and she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise to me is &quot; you ever going alcohol alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , i . . i promise . &quot;
i grew up on the land , rural rural rural south and i have a brother who &apos;s older and a year ago .
when i was about 14 or 15 , , one day , my brother came home , and i got this <unk> beer with , and my sister and me and went to the the forest .
we only just around around there as too .
and he took a drink of a of of a and and my sister sister and and and they got , and then i give me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . i &apos;m you . i don &apos;t want to leave any beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do . today we do do this , you &apos;re doing anything that we do .
i had what , your sister had had . go . &quot; go . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do it . do it . . &quot;
my brother painted me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? now , &quot; what . &quot;
then he saw me into the face , and he said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t still always crazy because of the entertainment with with a ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandmother , the of the that you &apos;re what . &quot;
i was destroyed the the .
i &apos;m going to give you some of .
i should not do that .
this is a public public public .
i &apos;m 52 , and i &apos;m a , i i i &apos;ve never had a a of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s <unk> . i say that because identity means .
if we can do the right kind of identity , we can say people around around us things that they &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they didn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would say her her her her her her .
my grandfather was in the <unk> in prison .
my uncle died of <unk> diseases .
and she believed that that are the subjects that we need to take care of .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 72 300,000 people were 300,000 people in <unk> and and in prison .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today , the highest world &apos;s highest world .
seven million people are on on the <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
i think , in my opinion , our world is fundamentally changing our world .
in the and black and black and black and of are despair and despair , because of changes .
one of three male male black between 18 and 30 is in prison prison prison , in prison , on on the <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
in urban communities , in the country -- from philadelphia , philadelphia , up to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of the black young men in in prison , in prison , or on on <unk>
and the system is not just by by by questions , by asking for <unk> , , it &apos;s also <unk> . poverty .
we have a a in this country that a a better better than if you &apos;re rich and guilty of a as an arm and innocent .
wealth , not <unk> , it &apos;s the result .
yet , we seem to be happy with it .
we believe a politics of fear and anger , convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we lost lost touch .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s a few more <unk> developments .
my dangerous &apos;s in , they they their <unk> to be <unk> .
here , in in in alabama , 34 percent of the male people are lost their <unk> .
we <unk> that in 10 years , the the of of of civic civic <unk> will be as as the <unk> of the <unk> .
and silence is <unk> .
i &apos;m children .
many of my client are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world , the children kids to death in the prison .
in this country , there is a <unk> for children without without without without no form of
we &apos;ve got a lot of stuff .
the only country in the world .
i <unk> people in <unk> .
the the of death penalty is an interesting question .
we believe it &apos;s because we &apos;ve taught that the real question is , has a human being deserves to die for a of of his ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think about about depending on how we see our identity .
the other view is not , anybody thinks of death death death , but we do it , we have it to kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
in nine people we &apos;ve executed for the , that we &apos;ve been a innocent , , and the the death row .
an amazing <unk> , one of nine innocent innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never let someone with an airplane with an airplane , if the nine planes , the , , .
but somehow we do it to this issue of this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i talk a lot about questions about these .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question , whether we &apos;re right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m my my students in african story , i talk about slavery .
i talk about terrorism , the time against the end of the <unk> , , to the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
but for the there , there was a time of terror .
in many lot of parts of people have had afraid of <unk> .
or before bombs .
it was the fear of terror who shaped her life .
and the older people come to me and say , &quot; mr. mr. , <unk> , you , you , you talk , you you say , you say , saying that you should stop saying that we have to do the first time in history of our nation , to the
they say , &quot; no -- say say that we grew up with that . &quot;
and after the terrorism , of course , the <unk> and <unk> are willing willing to engage and and apartheid .
and yet , in our country in our country , we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what what meaning our our were in the historic context .
we &apos;re constantly each other .
we create create new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to be able to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> is not to to the the the and the the and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , these willingness to , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany for the death death .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up to my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s profoundly bizarre , hear it &apos;s a . &quot;
he said , &quot; there &apos;s no death in germany .
and of course , you can never give it in germany . &quot;
it was quiet . then he said a woman : &quot; it &apos;s impossible to we have to we we ever that we we the systematic of of people .
it would be <unk> of us , and and behind people . &quot;
i thought about it .
as it would feel like to live in a world where the german state people were <unk> , particularly when the <unk> , , , , , a lot of jews .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , in this country , in the old <unk> , , we &apos;re people to -- -- here &apos;s the risk of being a death , 11 , more , when the victim is , , the the , , the the , the the , the the .
and yet there &apos;s this mental <unk> .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with these those difficult topics , those are the positive and and things are affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but , , these realities are <unk> of suffering , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
i seems to to to to both .
because we &apos;re going to talk about that we need more hope more engagement , more commitment to be able to be in complex world .
for me , time , to to to think about the poor , the poor , the the , that that will never be at ted .
but thinking think about a way that is in our our life .
we all have to believe the last end of the that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re we &apos;re , we &apos;re that we we .
innovation , creativity , and development is not not only from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the in our hearts .
it &apos;s this <unk> , i i think that &apos;s to us to be not only being to be all the all the light and and things , but also for the dark and the dark .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politicians , said .
&quot; when we fought in the eastern europe against we wanted to do anything , but what we needed most of hope , an mental , , the willingness to be in in places places and <unk> . &quot;
this mental mental is the core of the what i think is that the most of the to get to .
there &apos;s no a by technology and design that allows us to be to be human and to be human , as long as you can &apos;t have eyes and and and and and <unk> and <unk> .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity is a lot more of us than if we don &apos;t take care of .
she will going to touch it .
when i a a a i a a i a a i was the to meet the <unk> park park .
and , <unk> <unk> came back to <unk> , , where they were two of their ancient friends , women , women , <unk> <unk> , who had had the <unk> -- -- -- an incredible <unk> -- and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , dr. <unk> , <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> ,
so these women were together and just just just .
and , and , wife , and he said , &quot; <unk> , , , , , , , , , we want to talk to the city .
do you want to <unk> and and &quot; ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , very love . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; listen , listen . &quot;
and i went over and just just to .
it was so inspiring , so <unk> .
one day i was there and i heard this women , and after a few hours , i met met met to me , &quot; said , &quot; well , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; to me what they do
what are trying to do ? &quot;
i started my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to put against injustice .
<unk> , people want to help people who were innocent .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the <unk> .
we want to to <unk> without without no no of the for children .
we want to do something about the death death .
we want to reduce the number of of . .
we want to eliminate <unk> . &quot;
i thought i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . &quot; <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make it very , very tired . &quot;
and then , <unk> to to me , put one finger on my face and said , &quot; and so , &quot; and why you must be very , very , very , .
and so i think that the is the the to be the the ted community .
we need to to allow us to to these challenges , these challenges , these issues , that .
because ultimately , our humanity , from our humanity .
in my work i learned learned very simple things .
i learned some very simple things .
that we all are more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for any human beings on the planet .
if somebody is lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes a , that doesn &apos;t just have a a .
even who kills someone , is not just a murderer .
and because it &apos;s that &apos;s , there &apos;s a fundamental human human to to understand the law .
i also think that in many parts of this country , and in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think think that many places places that is the opposite of poverty .
and i think , i think that although though it &apos;s dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring and so , , we &apos;re not in the technology , not in the the things we don &apos;t not to our minds and mind .
and finally , a society is not measured society as they measured their rich and powerful and powerful and privileged to do it , but to the the the poor , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
because in this context , we start to the really amazing amazing things that make us .
i &apos;m losing the balance . a story .
sometimes i embrace to very . .
i &apos;m tired of how we all all .
sometimes these ideas are going to think about very important way .
i <unk> these kids who were convicted highly highly popular .
i go into the <unk> and and go to a client , the 13 or 14 years old , who &apos;s be to be an adult .
then i ask myself , how could that could ?
how can a judge a into something that that doesn &apos;t ?
the judge hit him as adults , but i see a child .
one night , i stayed too long time , and i thought , my god , if a judge can turn us into something different , then must have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should have one thing . wish .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think more right , i started working on a .
i had a <unk> , , poor young young people .
and i started to this . the headline headline said , &quot; , , , , &quot; , &quot; <unk> , <unk> &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> . &quot;
in my my , i explained that i to to to <unk> and and and the police and and .
there was a crazy line about that in this country , no more <unk> is that there &apos;s only real .
the next morning , i woke woke up and didn &apos;t know if i was worried about it , not to be it , or actually wrote .
and i , my horror , i had &apos;t had it to it , but it &apos;s also sent to the court .
a few months , over and i had just forget all .
but i decided , i decided , my god , i have to get into the case , and these these case case .
i went to the car , and i was overwhelmed overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that this is so hard , so painful .
and i went from my car , and i went the staircase for the court .
when i was the the to the court , there was an elderly , black man , the janitors in the dish .
and when he saw me , he came to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came up to me and and me .
then he the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
and i have to say , there was force .
it touched something deep deep in me , identity identity , the ability to each single , to a a community , a a a community of hope .
now , i walked into the <unk> .
once the judge ever saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , did you put this crazy to ?
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
more people would come in in , just because they were angry .
that i had these crazy things .
<unk> were coming in and <unk> and <unk> and workers workers .
in the <unk> , the the of people who were angry , and were angry that we &apos;re about about skin skin , about about , about inequality .
my my my , i saw the janitors at the day and go down .
he was seeing the window and and it could hear the whole whole thing .
he went up and down .
and finally , , older black man came with a very <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and and sat behind behind me , almost on the <unk> .
ten minutes later , judge announced a pause .
and the the pause came in a <unk> , , that was was the janitors did in the <unk> .
this <unk> ran over over the older black black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what are you doing in the ? ? &quot;
the older black black man stood up . he saw the the <unk> , then he saw me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here here , i &apos;m here to say to this man , losing her , , don &apos;t lose the
i &apos;ve come to ted , because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe , far more <unk> , but it &apos;s the justice .
that we are not fully designed as humans , we don &apos;t take care about rights rights and <unk> .
that our survival survival is each other is connected to each other .
that we have to connect our visions of technology and design , and to creativity and creativity to humanity , pity and justice .
and in big , i want to to those of you who are just just saying , you don &apos;t lose the , you don &apos;t lose the eyes out of eyes .
you &apos;ve seen in this audience , this community , a obvious wish and hear to help them and do something .
what can we do do ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> in this spring where it &apos;s actually about to to business , to a effort to the <unk> , who otherwise otherwise the the in politics .
here , in california , in the next five years , you will a billion dollars for a a a a a a a .
and yet 46 percent of all of not a a <unk> .
<unk> percent of all <unk> come come on .
here &apos;s the chance to do something .
this <unk> is will suggest to be to to money more more and more security .
i think there are options .
in the last three decades , the <unk> is been immense in in america .
this fact , this is often put in a relationship with the <unk> .
what would you say somebody who thinks that ?
now , in fact , the number of the doesn &apos;t change very much .
most of the most of in this country is not really really in the class of the .
it was the most <unk> against drugs .
so the dramatic is going to get the in in .
we we have <unk> from the rhetoric of punishment .
now we &apos;ve got &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , which bring people to the behind grid , for a <unk> , for the theft , good , , instead of being able to to to to to give the
i think we need to do more to help people who are the victims of a <unk> , not less .
and i think that our current is is helping helping .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , you &apos;ve got a string on a string .
they are a inspirational personality .
thank you for you . thank you .
by the conference of laden &apos;s a an increased <unk> of .
two : famine in somalia . <unk> the police . .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> . . five .
six of : these are are . . percent 65 dead dead .
8 eight : <unk> .
different , <unk> . . .
recession . it &apos;s <unk> . egypt .
crisis . death .
oh my god .
so these are just some of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it could have been the last six days . or the last six
in fact , the media is prefer to show the negative issues , because our mind is the best of the minds are .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for this .
every second every day , our senses are more to more information than our brain can ever process .
and because of it &apos;s not important important than our survival , is the first stop for all the information of all the information that the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early satellite system , our <unk> system .
it hit and <unk> the entire information looking for any of of risk of risk in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look at a news .
and the old old saying , &quot; when it &apos;s <unk> , is is the demand is very true .
now , with all our digital devices , that us seven days the week , 24 hours a day , a day of all all these negative news , it &apos;s not a wonder that we are pessimistic pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a wonder that everybody thinks it &apos;s the world is getting worse .
but maybe this is not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
maybe it &apos;s a enormous amount of that we &apos;ve done in the last century by a <unk> of forces that it &apos;s so that it &apos;s going to be able to make a world of abundance .
now , i &apos;m not saying that we have no big problems -- climate crisis , water , water water , water and and -- we &apos;ve already .
and as humans , we are much better at that , , but , but , but to to to it .
let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve done in the last century , we can predict that we can predict .
in the last 100 years , the average expectancy has more than doubled that inflation , the has has <unk> <unk> &apos;s population has has <unk> .
child mortality is a tenth of a .
and the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> and more <unk> costs costs have more of .
steve pinker showed us that we &apos;re in a very very very very very time time .
and according to charles <unk> &apos;s the the <unk> in the last 60 percent of 25 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget that .
and we increase our expectations always on .
in fact , we have <unk> poverty .
remember , a lot of americans who are living under the poverty line , live under the poverty line , wealth , water , toilets , , , , , television and television and and and cars
the richest capitalists of the last century , the earth &apos;s <unk> , never never could have like these .
the basis of of it is creating technologies , and these grow <unk> .
my great friend ray ray has shown shown that every tool that is being able to information technology , on the &apos;s a huge huge , , and the the 12 to 24 months months months .
that &apos;s why the cell cell in your pocket , a million times less times less and times more times a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law of the last hundred years .
and two things on this curve .
first , how big it is it &apos;s -- in good good times , or or war , war , recession , depression and <unk> .
this is the result of faster , that is <unk> <unk> .
it slowed it down for none of our great problems .
and also , despite the logarithmic <unk> on the left goes up .
so the growth growth itself accelerating .
and on this curve , on the &apos;s of moore &apos;s law , we find find a extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary technologies that are available to the .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; something that call my friends in <unk> , <unk> sensors and networks , robots , , the , 3d , , that to to to to to our planet , synthetic biology , <unk> , , , and food and food .
how many of you have the victory of of a supercomputer on &quot; risk ? &quot;
it was big big .
i &apos;ve got the the the and the the the i looked at the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson <unk> human human . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that artificial artificial intelligence to the world of a a .
four years ago , ray kurzweil , and i &apos;ve here at ted a new university called the university called .
we bring our students all all these technologies , with the focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students to create companies , products products and create the in a decade , within a decade of people are a a of of of people .
think about that a group of students can do the lives of billions of people today .
30 years ago , this would have discovered .
today we we now in dozens of business have had that this this .
if i think about that , , i don &apos;t mean a life of a life of each on this planet ; it &apos;s about about to life life of life .
it &apos;s about creating a of of goods .
scarcity is <unk> , and technology is a resources .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy &apos;s left .
he was invited the king of <unk> .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> , <unk> , <unk> himself .
but the king of <unk> , got <unk> .
aluminum was at this time of the most valuable metal on the planet , valuable than <unk> .
this is why the the of the this is made made of aluminum .
although aluminum aluminum has gets up , it it &apos;s not not a a metal .
it &apos;s connected through oxygen and and .
but then the technology was developed developed and and made the so cheap that we use it with our <unk> . .
and let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we think about <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;re on a planet with a more energy with more energy than we use a year .
16 <unk> energy <unk> energy , all <unk> <unk> of the earth &apos;s earth .
it &apos;s not the scarcity , the problem is . .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve been able to do it for the cost of solar power in india to 50 percent of the <unk> -- <unk> rupees in the compared 17 rupees .
the cost of solar energy fell in last year .
last month , this has published a study that showing that to the end of the decade , the the the the the the the the the the the united cents a cents a <unk> in the the national average .
and if we have a <unk> , , we will have the water water .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
remember , as carl sagan by the <unk> , in the , when it was to saturn , , back to earth earth ?
he took a famous photograph . what was it meant ?
&quot; a <unk> blue . &quot;
because we live on a <unk> . .
we live on a planet that is covered in a .
yeah , it &apos;s <unk> percent in , water percent , and we &apos;re fighting to percent percent percent of the water on the planet , but here there &apos;s hope hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on on the way , <unk> .
and from a conversation with dean kamen , one of the know , the know , i do it , i want to share with you -- -- he gave me the -- his <unk> -- his <unk> , , which is a lot of you , it &apos;s been heard of the size of a <unk> . .
it can produce a thousand gallons of a day every different sources -- -- -- -- -- <unk> , , , and -- and all of that for less than two cents a
the the of coca-cola has just <unk> , a a a <unk> with a hundred units in the developing world .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola will come to global global global in in in the across the planet .
this is <unk> innovation that are now .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
you know , my god , we &apos;re going to be the 70 percent of mobile phones in developing the end of 2013 .
just remember , a a <unk> with a mobile phone in the middle of kenya , a better <unk> in the in 25 years ago .
and if you look for your smartphone onto google , you have more access to knowledge and information as president clinton about 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication has the abundance of how no no have have predictions .
and it &apos;s better better , things that you have spent on a thousand dollars on you -- gps , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and , and of books and music , and , and , and , and , and , and .
and the best thing is possibly , what is in in the area .
in the last month , i had the pleasure , with the <unk> called the &quot; $ 10 years of <unk> x prize , &quot;
we demand teams around the world , all these technologies are to to connect together to a cell phone that you can talk to the device , because it with ai , , you can <unk> <unk> or it it .
and to win , to be a a better diagnosis , a team a team .
imagine that device in front of the middle of a developing developing , where there are no doctors doctors doctors , but though percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of the health .
if this device sequenced an <unk> system , <unk> , who doesn &apos;t know , it &apos;s it &apos;s not to to the the for the to and it it .
but now to the the to the to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; coming &quot; the next billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just out the the <unk> .
and the way , the the largest population population is a a education explosion , and food in the world .
in 2010 , we &apos;ve now been in two billion people online online .
by 2020 , we will go to two of two billion <unk> of two billion .
three billion new heads of which we never heard before , , the global communication is going to join the global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are they going to do ? what are you going to desire ?
and instead of of the of of of the largest economic of of history .
these people represent multiple trillion dollars that will flow into the global economy .
and they will be healthier by using the use of the , and they will better up to the the , and by the the , , and they they have to be the opportunity to use a 3d 3d and 3d computing ,
so what can you do three billion growing , healthy , , , productive members of the <unk> ?
how about a sentence , , never never before .
how about the the , the the , wherever you are , to give a voice to go to and change change , for the first time ,
what are these three billion people bring bring ?
how about the <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict how ?
one of the things i learned learned by x prize prize is that little teams that are are are motivated by passion and do extraordinary things things that are big big companies and governments in the past .
i want to finish with a story that really really me me .
there &apos;s a program that may be familiar with .
it &apos;s a game that solved solved solved .
it was evolved at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein will developing .
the after his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the <unk> .
so , this was a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played by university of . .
and there are been hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that today , the human pattern is better the the its protein folds as the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and and the best best of the the world was this , not a <unk> , , , it was a <unk> , , , , , , a a , the day , the the the the of the the world &apos;s best <unk> in the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what is tremendous trust in our future , is the fact that we have more power to do more than individuals to put our great challenges of our planet .
we have access access to tools .
we have the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of the .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work online to the the new challenges , and to do what it needed .
we expect a few decades decades .
thank you .
i think we need to have a a a of a <unk> of a <unk> of .
and i think it starts with a medical medical and i i &apos;m .
and maybe i &apos;ve been a long enough for a long enough , that i can allow me to give up a piece of my own false <unk> to give this .
but before i get to the to the talk of my talk , let &apos;s start with little little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re near the <unk> and and to the world world .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full full of wonderful statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; starts to and and about statistics and to use these use a lot baseball baseball .
i &apos;m going to to a statistic that i hope hope that most of you &apos;ve heard .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we talk about 300 if a bat <unk> .
that means that the players are certainly going to be three by .
that &apos;s a ball called the <unk> , , he will not be trapped , and who &apos;s not to to , and who &apos;s to throw the the to the first base , not time , and the the
three 10 10 .
you know how to call a a <unk> in baseball ?
well , really , maybe a a <unk> .
you know how to call a a a ? ?
that &apos;s someone in the only one of 10 .
<unk> -- -- like ted williams <unk> <unk> <unk> baseball <unk> baseball <unk> in a a <unk> season . 400 .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , i i to make lot more comfortable with a more , or maybe a little less i &apos;ve talked about about it .
suppose they have a <unk> and and they &apos;ll take a a <unk> , , <unk> , of the <unk> of in terms of <unk> .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
suppose they are in a certain remote area , and they have a beloved beloved / <unk> <unk> and and their <unk> <unk> , and <unk> this <unk> , in 200 <unk> , in 200 <unk> .
but , but you know what ?
she &apos;s better better . it &apos;s a a .
and they <unk> a <unk> . .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;ll ask you a question .
what do you think the the <unk> for a a or a nurse or a nurse or a a <unk> , a a <unk> , should be a ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody in all the medicine knows that a a a a a a or or or or or or or .
but what we do is we we , we , to to to , to be out in the world with being perfect .
never mistakes , no one do about the the details about the details of how how how to be done .
and this is the message that i took in school medical school .
i was a presidential <unk> <unk> .
in the high school school said a school school said that brian <unk> would learn to a <unk> .
and it was .
and i learned in my little <unk> in the sisters , the toronto , <unk> from here .
i learned everything it .
in my family , i learned the origins and the tail , every stick of a a , , the the , which from the aorta , <unk> <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i even knew the <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i i i i start more and more .
and i was fine , i &apos;d <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i left the school medical i i , if i knew what knows everything knew and everything knew , or at least as as as as as as as i could have to to that to do this .
and it worked for for a time , until i met printer .
i put in in a <unk> here in toronto , when woman was brought to the the of the hospital hospital . hospital .
at that point , i was a <unk> <unk> layer in the <unk> service .
and it was my mission when the most <unk> was was to study the <unk> .
and there &apos;s be to to my my <unk> .
i studied a girl printer , she was in <unk> .
and when i gave her in , they made sounds sounds .
and when i had her chest <unk> , , i could hear a <unk> sound on both sides that told me that she was under under <unk> heart of .
this is a state of the heart , rather than pump the whole blood blood , , part of the blood blood in your lung , and and it it down , so that came up , so the came the .
and that was not hard to get <unk> diagnosis .
i made it and made me the treatment .
i gave her her <unk> . i gave her to take the pressure of the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call <unk> , called , they out , they they the liquid .
and over a half a half to two hours , and she started feel better .
i felt really right .
and i i made my first mistake ; i sent sending them home .
actually , i did two mistakes .
i sent them back to talk with my favorite <unk> .
i didn &apos;t take up on up and and did what i should have had what would have had a call in my <unk> , to it it , so he had a a chance of a a own image .
and he knew she he would have been able to see the information to the .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the doctor &apos;s doctor .
maybe i wanted to succeed as well as as to do this , so that i was so so i would be able to worry about my patients without any .
my second mistake was worse .
and i it home , i i sent her home , i i a little silent voice to tell me , &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; , no good idea . do not do it . &quot;
in really , it really wasn that i really wasn that i was the the nurse , , , and , , , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; you think , &quot; you think it &apos;s okay if you go home ?
and the nurse thought about it , and in <unk> , &quot; &quot; , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;s going to go good . &quot;
i remember it as it was yesterday .
so i went to the <unk> and and and and and and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the the one day , the night i had this <unk> feeling in my stomach .
but i continued to work .
and at the end of the day , i would go to , that went off the hospital and went to drive the parking lot to the car when i did something i did not did .
i went through the <unk> on my way home .
and there was a other nurse , not the sister that had seen the girl printer she saw another other , but another three words , me and those three words of most of the most most i know .
other other other people would be that , but the most of is especially because because we &apos;re just the way to happen .
the three three are you remember ?
&quot; remember , &quot; you remember the patients that they ? &quot;
asked the nurse <unk> .
&quot; so she said , &quot; she said , &quot; she said in this particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back and die .
and one hour after she arrived at home , after sent her home , she collapsed and the the family , <unk> , and the the <unk> , to the <unk> <unk> , a a <unk> , which is a dangerous <unk> .
she would barely breathe and she was blue .
the <unk> <unk> moved in the .
they gave her <unk> .
they closed them to the the .
i was shocked to to the inside the inner .
and i lived through that this this <unk> , because she came to the <unk> , and i hoped that would had to recover .
and after two , three days , it &apos;s clear that she never never .
she didn &apos;t have through a through .
her had brought together their family .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , she would the the .
the the day , they them them -- wife printer printer , woman , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say you &apos;re never going to forget the names of the .
and that was the first time that knew that .
the next weeks weeks , i was at , and i first time the first <unk> of our our medical culture -- i felt , , , not , not the kind of healthy shame that you don &apos;t feel because you don &apos;t feel because you don &apos;t know about the colleagues .
you know , all of healthy healthy , if you &apos;re a secret secret to the best friend &apos;s if this one on <unk> <unk> , and you get caught and the best friend of the , and the best friend of a , , but you you , you you , you you you a mistake , but you you you you you
if you &apos;re doing <unk> , and you never never do it .
this is the kind of <unk> shame .
the conventional way of i &apos;m talking about is the that you &apos;re extremely <unk> .
it &apos;s the one that &apos;s not saying that &apos;s not what you &apos;re bad bad , but you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t up in my favorite , , he was very . .
he spoke with the family and i &apos;m sure he he the the <unk> and safe and safe i would not sued .
but i was asking for these questions .
why why i didn &apos;t ask the ? ? why why i i do it home ?
and then in my my moments , how could i make such a stupid mistakes ?
why am i go into medicine ?
but slowly it it it .
i started feel better feel better .
and then on a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke and i i i i i can feel better .
and i was that i i that if i tried to to perfection , and never never to a mistake in the that the voice could be the .
and she did .
and i continued to .
and then it happened back .
two years later , i had in the <unk> in in a <unk> hospital , in toronto , and i <unk> a years old man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot and i was in a a a .
he showed up here .
i looked into the <unk> , and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him to .
and even when he went out the door , he showed his his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my next <unk> and my my <unk> , to me to a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patients with the <unk> ? &quot;
it turns out that he &apos;s a <unk> . .
he had potentially a disease disease called <unk> .
you can you you , but it &apos;s not infection to the the , but the top of the and and it &apos;s the the the the .
and luckily , he didn &apos;t die .
he got <unk> <unk> and and , a few days later .
and i went back through the same <unk> of of shame and <unk> , and i went to and and it was to work and it it back .
in a a <unk> , i &apos;ve been an <unk> <unk> .
and you &apos;ve already heard a lot of , , in that you you in a hospital that had only 14 patients at that time .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was no any any in in their treatment .
and i thought , i was a <unk> .
i &apos;m the x-ray x-ray of the kidneys , and when it was without <unk> , my colleague , in the the , the patient &apos;s a <unk> in the lower right-hand sector and and called the <unk>
the other thing that was a lot of . .
i <unk> <unk> to to him to him and asked my my to report my my . .
and that &apos;s what he did , and he &apos;s a <unk> in the right lower sector , he called the <unk> .
both cases , both and and it was all .
both both of me to me me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistakes had happened only in the first five years , what what many of my colleagues claim , but come here here .
some of my favorite had happened in the last five years .
so , , , with , .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t finish my your your your your your , if you can talk about you , i tell you , i can &apos;t find what really happened to how how can i get with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes , so that they don &apos;t make the same ?
if i was in a room like now , now , i i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re thinking about me .
when do you have the last time of someone else about <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> ?
oh yeah , you &apos;re going to cocktail cocktail party and there you you hear about any other doctor , but you don &apos;t hear someone about about your mistake .
if i put a full full of colleagues and and to to to to to , and everyone to tell you what i told you , i i was going to be able to do the end of the second story before you really would a joke , you would really , to you , you would you know , you you &apos;d forget the issue .
and in fact , when my colleagues knew that a <unk> in in my hospital had lost the the the the leg , then you believe me , i would have problems to look at the eyes .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a completely denial from your .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- the ones that make mistakes and and those who do not do , the ones who are <unk> and and the without the , and the with bad results .
it &apos;s almost a ideological response of the antibodies , attack people .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we &apos;re the ones that we make the mistakes in medicine that us us a system .
but there are two problems in this .
in my about 20 years of the medical <unk> , journalism , i have a personal medical study about medical mistakes and and and around the possible one of my first article that i first article for the first first first first first first &quot; white <unk> , black kind , &quot;
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely <unk> .
we &apos;re in in a system in the day in a a of a , in a a of 10 or or a wrong wrong , or the <unk> , and and more and more and more and more and , .
in this state , , by 24,000 <unk> to be <unk> .
in the united states , the institute at the for medicine .
they &apos;re both strong <unk> because we &apos;re not thinking about the problem as it should .
and is the <unk> . .
in a <unk> in in the medical health in the , , to the two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up with .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get it rid of it .
we own cognitive mistake , so we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient can go to an chest .
then i take the same patients with <unk> , make it <unk> and <unk> and and , and , and , and , and , and it &apos;s a a of the the story of contempt .
i &apos;m not going the same way .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me your symptoms always the same .
all just just together are are inevitable .
so if you take the system that way , as i taught taught , and all the <unk> <unk> gets out , , then , at end end , no more left .
and you know , the the of people who don &apos;t want to speak about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white <unk> , black &quot; &quot; i have the habit of &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to the the the the the of the , , , , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah ,
and then their their their their their their , they &apos;re upon the head , and look down and eat and , and to to tell their stories .
they want their stories . they want their stories .
you want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t the same mistakes that i &apos;m . &quot;
what you need is an environment that which you to it .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the <unk> used to be a human being a person , to be his humanity , it &apos;s not to make it mistakes , but everything everything from from you to learn , so it can be passed on .
it &apos;s her experiences with others .
they &apos;re given to the time of your errors .
and they &apos;re them other their mistakes , not about <unk> , , but in a loving , , doing all of that .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life and when it &apos;s , , then people do some errors from time .
so that the system system to create <unk> <unk> that make make make make mistakes to find out to make that people inevitable , and it enables to to to to , doing a , , and , and , and the the of the sense of the or to the sense of the or the sense of the choice , and the sense of the sense of the or to the sense of the sense of
my name is brian anderson .
i &apos;ve been offered the .
i &apos;m a man . i &apos;m mistakes .
but i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn best to to it to to others others .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re to me , but i can live .
so let me close with three of my words words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea of a minute , i &apos;ll tell you about three stories that i to use time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he &apos;s <unk> here .
they may think that he <unk> , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he collected fish .
he described one of them , &quot; usually . &quot;
it was a <unk> . .
until the the 80s in the , it became a <unk> . .
now he &apos;s now under the <unk> of now .
this is a story of many times of the the galapagos or from other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet still come to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re are originally .
the <unk> describe describe the <unk> as a . .
what &apos;s happened here ?
the second story is another concept that &apos;s a <unk> , , .
because i experienced it , i was doing in in in <unk> .
i went there , because i grew up in europe and later later later in africa .
i thought i could integrate .
and i got a bad <unk> , and i convinced that i really didn &apos;t really that .
it was my first <unk> . .
as you can see , the lagoon and <unk> <unk> and by some of .
there were <unk> of about 20 inches , <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> of of these <unk> were were very <unk> and and were were <unk> and and were making in in in .
when i got there there , there was the that that was to half of the size of it .
growing up , five inches .
they were genetically <unk> .
there were still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish that &apos;s also be to be there .
so it has nothing changed , and yet changed everything .
my third little story tells me about my favorite story of the <unk> in the southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s , the beginning of the &apos; 60s -- <unk> europe -- <unk> europe .
<unk> countries meant that that they had 100 fish fish , the industrial made of this fairly ugly ship , <unk> .
i was driving on and we did and we were in the southern southern ocean and and especially in the <unk> .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started .
now i know it &apos;s the the of the ocean .
90 percent of our <unk> were sponges , other animals that are connected to the .
the the biggest part of the fish that are the little dots there on the , the <unk> , , were <unk> .
basically , the the the the the the the and and then it was <unk> .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition is very quickly .
within a year , you get an survey , and then it &apos;s the the commercial fishing .
the reason is changed . in this case -- in this case -- a a -- or soft corals is <unk> .
this is a dead <unk> .
they didn &apos;t eat her , they threw away because they were dead .
once we started a alive .
she wasn &apos;t <unk> .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat it well .
in fact , this is of the of of of of of of of play you have to to you in areas that has never been in
it &apos;s not documented documented .
we &apos;re the world , but we don &apos;t remember that .
we &apos;re our our <unk> our new level and we don &apos;t put in memory , what was there .
if you &apos;re it , , here &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
and the y-axis is a few good things : biodiversity , number of <unk> , the green of the the green , the the .
it &apos;s it it changes . it &apos;s changing because people are their very , of course .
every generation of looking at the images that you take out of your conscious of your conscious life as standard and is going to win it .
and the difference is the difference as loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
it can give order order of changes .
and then , you end up just to the the remains of the remains .
now , that &apos;s now largely largely through our goal .
we want to get things that are disappeared or things that are not so much as they were .
you could think that the problem that people were in that lived in in in animals , , , , , and , and , and maybe , to a few of of the , what they did .
because obviously , an animal that has been a very , , fact , rarely , until it &apos;s .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of animals .
you &apos;re moving to the animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not a big loss .
and time time we focus on the big animals and the the the the fish are the big fish .
they &apos;re going to , because we &apos;re them .
time time there is a fish left and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is , why people accept that .
well , because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
of course , many people , , scientists , tell , it was really different .
you &apos;ll be it , because the evidence , how you &apos;re in in an pattern shape , not as way you would to to the to the .
for example , there &apos;s example example anecdote that the report report on a <unk> project that was seeing in this area , not not be not to be not , because it doesn &apos;t normally get a scientific ,
so we have the the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we are in in educated societies because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows that the enormous large role that can play a marine marine .
because by , , we we , we basically the past .
we &apos;re the the past that people can &apos;t understand because the the change is changed and very low .
so people people who can see a marine marine and and benefit from the ones that make it to <unk> their <unk> .
what about the people that that cannot &apos;t do that because they don &apos;t have access -- the the people in the the west , for example ?
here , i think , i think the art and the film that you fill in gap , and simulation simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago there were <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> , you may remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , if you think about why people have been touched by this -- except apart from the <unk> , , why were it so being ? ?
because it &apos;s something that &apos;s a a way that &apos;s lost in a way .
so my my , the only one i &apos;m going to to to cameron , to this this &quot; <unk> . &quot;
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in communist <unk> , , you had to , if you had a typewriter , that have the government .
they also had to have a sheet of <unk> from this typewriter .
the reason for that : government could be warm where where a text came from .
they found a paper <unk> <unk> , they could able to detect the creator of this thoughts .
and we couldn &apos;t understand the the as what anyone might do something like that would be the free of free freedom .
in our own countries , we would never do something .
but if you put a a new <unk> of of the today &apos;s leading <unk> , and one page , and then this is the the light on on the page , on a pattern , in a pattern that &apos;s clearly the side to you and your printer .
that &apos;s happening today .
and it seems like nobody &apos;s <unk> .
and this was an example of which our own governments were the technology against us , citizens .
and this is one of the three <unk> of the living things today .
let &apos;s look at what happens in the world , we can divide the attacks into categories .
we have three <unk> . .
there are <unk> . .
for example , this is mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
and the the of are are very easy to understand .
these people money money money .
they use <unk> to make a lot of money , a a huge bunch of money .
there are several cases cases of <unk> <unk> , <unk> that have their money by attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in estonia .
this is alfred <unk> .
stephen watt .
<unk> <unk> .
this is matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so on .
these people have come up to a and , but they &apos;ve created it illegal by using them to to to to claws , trying to save our <unk> , , as we &apos;re doing , and we &apos;re <unk> , and we &apos;re <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
the u.s. u.s. agency &apos;s <unk> <unk> , two months months ago , mr. sam &apos;s academy of mr. sam &apos;s , and on account for <unk> million dollars , it was frozen .
mr. allen itself is free foot , the <unk> is unknown .
and i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s more likely to be that we &apos;re going to be victims of a <unk> , as a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to be worse .
in the future , most crime are going .
the second largest <unk> that we can see today is not motivated by money .
they are motivated by something -- -- about , , , or through the audience .
anonymous groups are been taken over the last last 12 months and and to one of the <unk> of on the field of the .
so these are the three <unk> : criminals that say it the money for money , <unk> , to be <unk> , , but the last group group group nations have governments , governments who lead attacks .
there are that that are that the of the .
it &apos;s a a that is what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> of from the netherlands -- or it was it .
in the last fall , it had to be <unk> , because because <unk> was been hacked .
someone was been been and had been making a physical <unk> .
and last week in a meeting with dutch dutch , , i asked one of the senior senior of this group that whether it &apos;s possible for possible that because because of the people people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how do people die in a of such a remote ?
<unk> is a <unk> . .
they sell selling them .
what do you do with ? ?
now , a certificate , you you you a a website with <unk> service , for example , .
now we &apos;re all , or a lot of us , , , or her competitors , but these services are particularly especially in states like iran , where the foreign foreign nino like like , , you know , that the the are <unk> to be more <unk> than local <unk> , and that the local government doesn &apos;t have in their conversation .
but you can , if you go into a foreign foreign .
<unk> <unk> and fake <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened in the case of <unk> .
how about the arab spring and the things that happened in egypt ?
now in egypt , the <unk> in april april , the headquarters headquarters in egyptian egyptian who they found a lot of records .
in this records was a called called a called <unk> .
and in that folder , there were a big in in local local local local , who had sold a to a to a few programs that they -- -- very large at very large frame of egyptian citizens .
they had this this program to <unk> to use the egyptian government .
the <unk> is is right here .
so western governments governments <unk> governments with <unk> to to to their own citizens .
but western governments help them help themselves .
for example , in germany just a few weeks ago , called called <unk> <unk> , which was a <unk> <unk> that was used by german <unk> to to to to their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be a <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s safe to your your phone .
but today we are far beyond .
they tap down the internet connection .
they use use tools like the <unk> to to with a computer <unk> , who allows them to to their their their their their , their <unk> , their <unk> their <unk> .
so if we think about things things things , and then the obvious would be to to the answer , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not me , because i &apos;m a a citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i don &apos;t have anything to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
privacy must be given .
privacy doesn &apos;t matter to debate .
it &apos;s not a decision that &apos;s is between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control .
and as we today today , 2011 , our governments to trust , , is every right we we &apos;ll be coming , and it &apos;s coming .
and trust we trust we blind we blind , a the , the government , government government that maybe we might have in years years ?
these are the questions that we need to have the next 50 years .
it may seem weird to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> <unk> were made <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk> , a simple idea : <unk> <unk> has set up in the , that fit fit
<unk> were very rapidly , the <unk> <unk> in the world .
they put us in the to build things that were bigger than we , building , bridges , a stone after the other .
basically , the the of the the time of the time of time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out of this .
it was called the &quot; automatically rock . &quot;
and within less years , in lego into a .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion billion billion rocks have been or 75 each each each person on this planet .
you don &apos;t need to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , making beautiful bridges or beautiful building .
lego , it it for all .
lego , basically the the <unk> , the world building building , and it was a building building for our imagination .
in the meantime , in the early labs , the bell labs , the next revolution , the next next building .
the transistor was a small <unk> of <unk> that which us of a a of deep , , <unk> building blocks of a world was a .
like the <unk> , , allows us to build a much larger larger to to more these and and these these , a stone .
but there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> : the transistor was only for experts .
i don &apos;t accept that that the building block of the time of experts is , and so i decided to change this .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea of how to do the power of the engineers of poor and and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic rich that have a specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , , sound , motor and and sensor .
and the best part is that they connect together together with magnet together .
so you can &apos;t put it around .
the rocks are <unk> .
green is copy , blue is is , pink is input and orange is . .
so everything you have to do is to to do is to connect an blue and and and you can connect it quickly , and
you add one blue one green green , and you can make light .
you can put a wall in between and they have a a little <unk> .
take the switch out to take a <unk> , , and , and put into a , and they &apos;ve done a little <unk> .
add them the <unk> for a more effect on an extra one and they made a <unk> . .
i &apos;ll stop this .
beyond the simple simple , , , , actually , powerful .
instead of having a program , you to to code , or <unk> , allows you to to to to and both and and .
so to slow it down the the , or slow , slow , turn , just just this button and it makes the impulse faster
the idea behind is is that it &apos;s a a library .
we want to get every single interaction in this world into a <unk> stone .
lights , the , , motors , motors should be available .
we &apos;ve got <unk> children to children and they play with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful , how you start to the electronics that you to understand understand the the and they don &apos;t learn .
like , for example , a <unk> system works , or why the the doors to the , or or as an ipod react to
we &apos;ve also brought <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so , for example , we had no have any designers in in in in in in the experience that started playing with with materials .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and bottles , as <unk> <unk> ...
a few weeks ago , we have <unk> risd and gave them some designers that had no of of experience -- -- -- box , and and and and they said , &quot; do you do . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that made , made a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> of of that fear fear in darkness .
for these <unk> , , <unk> , another material , being another material , just another material .
and we want to make this material for everyone available .
so , &apos;s open source .
you can go to the website , all all download all the your , and and .
we want to to the the world of creators , the inventor , encourage the to , because this world in which we live in , this interactive world , we &apos;ve heard about it .
so , pull out , and you start invent them .
thank you .
